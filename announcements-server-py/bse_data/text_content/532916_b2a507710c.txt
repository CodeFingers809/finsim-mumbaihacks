Independent Auditor's Review Report on the Unaudited Standalone Financial Results of the 
Company for_the quarter and half year ended 30" September’ 2025 pursuant to the 
Regulations 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations & Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015, as amended, 
To, 
The Board of Directors of 
Barak Valley Cements Limited 
Debendra Nagar, Jhoombasti, 
P.O. Badarpurghat, Distt. Karimganj, 
Assam-788803 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of Un-audited Standalone financial results 
(‘the Statement’) of Barak Valley Cements Limited (‘the Company’), for the quarter and half- 
year ended 30% September’ 2025, together with Notes thereon attached herewith, being submitted 
by the Company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the Securities and Exchange 
Board of India (Listing Obligations & Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended. 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company’s Management and approved by 
the Board of Directors in their meeting held on 14" November’ 2025, has been prepared in 
accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting 
Standards (Ind AS) for Interim Financial Reporting (Ind AS 34), prescribed under Section 133 of 
the Companies Act, 2013 read with the relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the 
Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagement (SRE) 2410, “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This 
standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether 
the statement is free from material misstatement. A review of interim financial information 
consists of making enquiries, primarily of the Company’s personnel responsible for financial and 
accounting matters and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially 
less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently 
does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that 
might be identified in an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion. 
L FRN ataseeN)
4. Based on our review conducted as stated above, nothing has come to our attention that causes 
us to believe that the accompanying statement prepared in accordance with the applicable 
Accounting Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under Section 133 of Companies Act, 2013 read with 
relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has 
not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Listing Regulation 33 of SEBI 
(Listing Obligations & Disclosure Requirements)Regulations, 2015, including the manner in 
which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.

Independent Auditor's Review Report on the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results of 
the Company for the quarter and_half vear ended 30'" September’ 2025 pursuant to the 
Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations & Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 
2015 (as amended) 
To, 
The Board of Directors of 
Barak Valley Cements Limited 
Debendra Nagar, Jhoombasti, 
P.O. Badarpurghat, Distt. Karimganj, 
Assam-788803 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited Consolidated Financial Results 
(‘the Statement’) of Barak Valley Cements Limited (“the Parent Company”) and its 
subsidiaries (the Parent and its Subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”) for the quarter 
and half year ended 30™ September, 2025 (“the Statement”), together with notes thereon attached 
herewith, being submitted by the Parent company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 
of the SEBI (Listing Obligations & Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended. 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Parent Company's Management and 
approved by the Parent Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the 
recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 “Interim 
Financial Reporting” (“Ind AS 34”), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, 
read with the relevant rules issued there under and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our 
review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity” as specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 
2013. This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance 
as to whether the statement is free from material misstatements. A review of interim financial 
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and 
accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and 
consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all 
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit 
opinion, 
We also performed procedures in accordance with the circular issued by the SEBI under 
Regulation 33(8) of the SEBI Listing Regulations, to the extent applicable. 
4. The Statement includes the unaudited financial results of the Parent and the following 
Subsidiaries: 
 Cement International Limited (CIL) 
*Badarpur Energy Private Limited (BEPL) 
*Meghalaya Minerals and Mines Limited (MMML) 
* Valley Strong Cements (Assam) Limited (VSCAL) 
5. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above, 
nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standard and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended, 
including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
