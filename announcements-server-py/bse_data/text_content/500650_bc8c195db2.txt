Pooja Swami: Good evening, everyone. Welcome to the Q2 and H1 FY26 Earnings Conference Call of Excel 
Industries Limited. 
Today on the call, we have with us Mr. Ravi Shroff – Managing Director, Mr. Pradeep Ghattu – 
President and COO, and Mr. Devendra Dosi – CFO. 
This conference call may contain forward-looking statements about the company which are 
based on beliefs, opinions, and expectations as of today. Actual results may differ materially.  
These statements are not the guarantees of the future performance and involve risks and 
uncertainties that are difficult to predict. A detailed safe harbor statement is given on page 2 of 
the Investor Presentation of company which has been uploaded on the Stock Exchange. 
With this, now I hand over the call to Mr. Shroff for his opening remarks. Over to you, sir. 
Ravi Shroff: Thank you, Pooja. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen  and thank you for joining us today for 
the Q2 and H1 FY26 earnings call. We are happy to continue the practice initiated in May 2025 
of hosting a half-yearly conference call for our investors with the intent of keeping investors and 
analyst community familiar with and updated about our results and relevant major developments. 
While we remain committed to transparency, please note that all discussions will be conducted 
within the boundaries appropriate to our competitive positioning. 
With this, let me begin with a brief overview of the company.  As you  all are aware, Excel 
Industries is one of India's oldest chemical companies with a rich legacy and a pioneering role 
in the Indian chemical industry. Over the years, we have evolved into a focused specialty 
chemicals player while continuing to operate our waste management business which contributes 
around 1% of the revenue. The chemicals division forms the core of our business and spans into 
four major product lines.  Agrochemical intermediates, yellow phosphorus, that is YP 
derivatives, performance solutio ns and pharma intermediates and APIs. We hold leadership 
positions in several key agrochemical intermediates supported by global scale capacities and 
strong backward integration. We are the pioneers in phosphorus chemistry in India. We leverage 
this streng th in manufacturing various YP derivatives. Our performance solution product 
portfolio comprises of phosphonates, biocides, mining chemicals and polymer inputs, property 
modifiers, and functional additives where we continue to deepen our capabilities. In p harma

intermediate and API, we operate in select products where our strength lies in complete 
backward integration into basic intermediates.  Our manufacturing footprint for chemicals 
extends across three sides, Roha and Lote Parshuram in Maharashtra and Vi shakhapatnam in 
Andhra Pradesh. 
Further, updating you on the recent developments, we are pleased to inform you all that we have 
signed a binding term sheet with a reputed Indian specialty chemicals company for contract 
manufacturing and supply of a special ty chemical. This long -term arrangement spanning five 
years will involve setting up a new dedicated production line expected to be commissioned by 
June 2026 with an estimated investment of Rs 40 crores. This arrangement is expected to 
generate an annual revenue of 35 crores to 40 crores excluding the cost of raw materials and is 
EBITDA accretive . This arrangement will leverage the customer's market access for the 
downstream end products and our strengths in core areas to deliver a win -win for both 
organizations. For our company, this is a significant step towards strengthening our position in 
contract manufacturing and will reduce our dependence on the agrochemical sector. We will be 
receiving a trade advance of Rs 25 crores from the customer.  The CAPEX for this project is in 
line with our business plan of investing Rs 200 crores to 300 crores including maintenance and 
growth CAPEX in the next three years. In addition to this, we have successfully commissioned 
a capacity expansion of one of our key biocide products in October 2025. As shared in our May 
2025 update, we had entered into a long -term supply arrangement with a leading multinational 
company. I am pleased to report that the initial supplies under this contract have commenced.  
Our new R&D center launc hed last year is on track to become operational in Q3 FY26. This 
milestone reflects our ongoing commitment to innovation, product development, and long-term 
value creation. 
Looking ahead, our strategic focus remains firmly anchored in building a resilient and future -
ready organization. With decades of domain expertise and a strong foundation in specialty 
chemicals, we continue to leverage our core strength, robust process R&D , integrated 
manufacturing, and longstanding customer relationships. Our commitment to environment, 
health and safety and sustainability remains central to our growth philosophy.  The 
commissioning of a long-term supply contract and a biocide capacity expansion are key enablers 
of sustained value creation. 
With this, I would like to hand over the call to my colleague Mr. Devendra Dosi, the CFO, to 
take you all through the financials of the company. 
Devendra Dosi: Thank you, Ravi Bhai. Good evening, everyone, and welcome to our Q2 and H1 FY26 earnings 
conference call. We sincerely appreciate your time and continued interest in Excel Industries 
Limited. Let me walk you through our financial highlights for Q2 and H1 FY26.

 Page 4 of 12 
Starting with the quarterly highlights, on a standalone basis, we close the quarter with revenues 
of 270 crores versus 310 crores in Q1 FY26. The revenue decline during the quarter was 
primarily driven by the subdued demand in agrochemical segment impacted by an extended 
monsoon season coupled w ith low demand of certain key products.  The exports contributed 
17.7% of the total revenue in the quarter. EBITDA for the quarter stood at 30 crores, down 29% 
sequentially from 42 crores. Profit after -tax came in at 19 crores, down from 34 crores in the 
previous quarter.   
For the first half of the year, net operating revenue stood at R s. 580 crores, a 9% increase over 
534 crores in H1 FY25. EBITDA for H1 FY26 came in at 72 crores versus 88 crores in the same 
period previous year. Profit after  tax for the pe riod stood at 52 crores, down 20% versus H1 
FY25. 
That concludes my remarks. We now open the floor for questions. 
Moderator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question 
comes from the line of Sudesh D with Ambit Capital. 
Sudesh D: I want to ask, inventory levels across the agrochemical industry have been elevated for several 
quarters. What is Excel's current inventory position compared to Q1? 
Ravi Shroff: I will request Mr. Devendra to take this question. 
Devendra Dosi: In a sense you are right that inventory levels have gone up in agrochemical segment considering 
the current situation. In our case, it has increased by 15% to 20% from the previous quarter. 
Sudesh D: On the CAPEX side, what is the CAPEX spend in H1? And if you can help me with the outlook 
for full year FY26? 
Ravi Shroff: Mr. Devendra will respond again. 
Sudesh D: Do you bring Greenfield or Brownfield projects into consideration? 
Ravi Shroff: Can't answer those specific questions.  But as we have shared, there's the latest contract. You 
may have seen that update. 
Sudesh D: And the CAPEX spend? 
Ravi Shroff: The CAPEX spend is also mentioned in the latest contract, which I read out in my speech as 
well, 35 crores to 40 crores for this con tract and also some other developments were shared in 
the previous call as well as updates through the last few months. 
 Excel Industries Limited

Sudesh D: Over the next few years which business verticals do you expect to drive incremental growth? 
Contract manufacturing, specialty chemicals, or the environmental segment. Anything specific 
if you can throw light on? 
Ravi Shroff: While we'll continue to focus on all our segments, we believe that performance solutions will 
see perhaps faster growth than the other segments. That being s aid, we will be looking at all 
opportunities that we receive, and we will be taking a call case-to-case basis. 
Moderator: Our next question comes from Sunny Vishe with Axis Securities.  
Sunny Vishe: First is how should we think about margin sustainability in the coming courses , g iven the 
changes in product mix, raw material procurement, and the demand development? And secondly, 
what are the top 2-3 long-term growth drivers for the company? 
Ravi Shroff: The margins, so just to update, Q3 is typically lean for the agro -chemical sector. As we have 
shared for a full year, we expect 13% to 15% as shared earlier. And ongoing basis also we expect 
13% to 15% EBITDA margins. And regarding your second question, as we ha ve shared to the 
previous caller as well, performance solution is something we believe will be contributing to the 
growth of the company. Recent initiatives in contract manufacturing as well, particularly I think 
we have shared two or three updates in the recent times where we have given the disclosures as 
well, that contract manufacturing is something the company is looking at. 
Moderator: Our next question comes from the line of Dhavan Shah from Alfaccurate Advisors.  
Dhavan Shah: My question is on the incremental revenue in the H2. I think you mentioned in the presentation 
that the Biocide product is also that plant is also commissioned and maybe the dispatch has also 
started. So, what could be the incremental revenue which can come from this portfolio in the 
H2? I think there were also one of the manufacturing contract for polymer if I am not wrong in 
the last year which was about to start in the second half also. So, if you can share thoughts on 
how much incremental revenue we can see from both of thes e products during this fiscal plus 
next year also. 
Ravi Shroff: While we made the disclosure that we invested 10.33 crores for a new plant, the revenue from 
that we are expecting is 15 crores  which is EBITDA accretive . This is a full year revenue 
expected. For the other opportunity, let me just check. The other product that we are looking at 
is about 10 crores to 12 crores top line turnover when it is full stream. The latest contract 
manufacturing update that we have disclosed that the top line revenue for us will be 35 crores to 
40 crores at full stream. 
Dhavan Shah: Combining all these three products, I think the revenue would be roughly 60 crore odd and that 
is at the peak, right? So, peak would come by next year itself or it will take FY28. 
 Excel Industries Limited 
November 14, 2025 
 
 Page 6 of 12 
Ravi Shroff: A clarification on the third one that I told you, 35 crores to 40 crores, that is excluding the cost 
of raw materials. And it will be staggered over the next 12 to 18 months, I would say. Peak will 
be difficult to say exactly when it will peak because the y are three different products, three 
different projects. But you can read the disclosures and information is available. 
Dhavan Shah: You mentioned that that is excluding the cost of raw material.  So, does that mean that raw 
material will also be supplied by the standalone business? 
Ravi Shroff: Raw material is supplied by the customer. 
Dhavan Shah: Because I think we are also manufacturing the intermediates. 
Ravi Shroff: In this particular case, it will be supplied by the customer. 
Dhavan Shah: For the base business, in the H1 we did roughly 8% growth in terms of the revenue and margin 
I think more or less we have maintained that guidance which you mentioned in the Q4 con call, 
which is 1 1% to 12%.  So, going forward in second half how do you see the base business 
growth? Because I think the last year H2 was low base in terms of the operation al numbers, I 
think we'll do a strong performance in terms of the operational wise in the H2. But internally, 
top line numbers, how do you see the growth for base business? And how do you see the product 
pricing, the EPC, and the other products? 
Ravi Shroff: I can't give specific comments on product pricing,  it's dynamic, but I can share with you that 
typically Q3 is a lean quarter for us, particularly because of the agrochemical sector. For the full 
year, as I mentioned, we are targeting 13 % to 15% EBITDA guidance. What has happened in 
the agrochemical season is that there has been a prolonged monsoon this year  which has 
disrupted a lot of the agronomic cycles and there's a channel inventory accumulation due to that. 
We see normalization of demand to some extent due to abundant groundwater levels resulting 
in a better winter crop cycle. This is our expectation if there are no other disruptions and  full-
scale revival of demand could happen sometime in Q4 or little beyond that. And it will really 
depend on the pace at which the accumulated inventory gets cleared. 
Dhavan Shah: But this quarterly run rate of 300 crores odd  would continue by and large f or the next two 
quarters, right? 
Ravi Shroff: Can’t comment specifically on top line revenue. So, margin guidance we have given already 
because as I said, the prices are dynamic, it really depends. 
Moderator: Our next question comes from the line of Dhara Maheshwari from SMSB.  
Dhara Maheshwari: I have a question regarding the export contribution. The export contribution has declined this 
quarter compared to the previous one. Can you please give us some color about this decline? 
 Excel Industries Limited 
November 14, 2025 
 
 Page 7 of 12 
Ravi Shroff: The reduced export contribution is due to lower demand for our products in certain key markets. 
Dhara Maheshwari: Which product categories or segments are the largest contributors to your exports? 
Ravi Shroff: Performance chemicals is the largest contributor. 
Dhara Maheshwari: How do you expect your margins to trend in in H2 FY26? 
Ravi Shroff: As I have  shared already, ful l year  guidance, we've given as 13 % to 15 % EBITDA at the 
moment, we maintain that. 
Moderator: Our next question comes from the line of Bhavin Soni from B&K Securities.  
Bhavin Soni: I want to get some light on the raw material price movement this quarter, particularly for the 
intermediate source from China and how do you see it going forward for H2? 
Ravi Shroff: Raw material prices have gone up in the recent quarter, and we don't have too much exposure to 
sourcing from China. 
Bhavin Soni: Any outlook for H2 for the same? 
Ravi Shroff: You mean raw materials, or you mean something else? 
Bhavin Soni: Pricing, the same, raw material. 
Ravi Shroff: Again, it's very dynamic, very difficult to say. It all depends on product cycles.  We see 
sometimes quarter to quarter variations.  So, very, very hard to make any kind of specific 
comment on this. 
Bhavin Soni: The next question I wanted to ask was about the waste management and environmental services 
segment performance in Q2. How was it from your perspective? 
Ravi Shroff: The outlook remains stable for the moment. We've done some consolidation. As you are aware, 
it represents only 1% of our revenues for the company. So, that's basically the outlook. 
Moderator: Our next question comes from the line of Dhiraj Shah with RG Investment. 
Dhiraj Shah: I have two questions. Firstly, what was the Trump tariffs and additional tariffs impact on your 
business and how were you able to sustain it? Like, did you employ any particular strategy or 
measures to maybe circumvent that? Could you shed some light on that, that would be helpful. 
Ravi Shroff: We were not significantly impacted by the tariffs. 
 Excel Industries Limited 
November 14, 2025 
 
 Page 8 of 12 
Dhiraj Shah: Secondly, how was the demand scenario in the domestic agrochemical market during the quarter 
especially considering the torrential rains and maybe that would have led to accumulation of 
channel inventory levels. Could you shed some light on that? 
Ravi Shroff: Demand was weak because of the extended monsoon. It led to delays in sowing and harvesting. 
Even the spray cycles were disrupted and there was significant crop damage.  As late as 
November this month, there was rainfall in some parts of India which has af fected, so that has 
impacted and that has created the build-up of inventory, and we are hopeful that this inventory 
will start clearing. As I have shared with the previous callers as well, the Q3 is expected to be 
subdued which historically happens for us.  But maybe by Q4 there should be some things 
coming back on track. 
Moderator: Our next question comes from the line of Riju Dalui with Antique Stock Broking.  
Riju Dalui: Is it possible to provide a rough number in terms of across our overall portfolios?  How much 
will be the agro -intermediate and how much will be the rest of the segment? Is it possible to 
share that rough number? 
Ravi Shroff: This is something we have shared earlier as well, I believe. Agro -chemical intermediates is 
roughly 50% to 60% of our revenues. The YP segment is 7% to 10% of revenues. Performance 
solutions is 25 % to 30% of the revenues. And pharma intermediates and API is 6 % to 8% of 
revenues. As shared, waste management is roughly 1% of the revenue of the company. 
Riju Dalui: In terms of your export business which is on a yearly bas e 18% to 20% exports that you do on  
topline, is it mostly the agro-intermediate sort or some mix of all the other segments? 
Ravi Shroff: It's mostly in the performance solutions that we have. 
Riju Dalui: In terms of CAPEX, you have mentioned a few CAPEX comprising roughly 35 plus 10 .  So, 
roughly 50 crores to 60 crores under the CAPEX, so this the new CAPEX that you are 
undergoing, is that correct? 
Ravi Shroff: Yes, it is new CAPEX in addition to the maintenance CAPEX that we already do. 
Riju Dalui: Overall, the 50 crores to 60 crores CAPEX that you have mentioned earlier, and that will provide 
a visibility for maybe next 2-3 years, right? And beyond that, is there any new CAPEX that you 
are doing or maybe another debottlenecking kind of a CAPEX, so that we can expect some 
strong volume growth over next 2-3 years period? 
Ravi Shroff: Debottlenecking is something we keep doing all the time,  that's part of what we do. We have 
given our guidance for capital expenditure in the range of 200  crores to 300 crores which 
includes the maintenance and growth initiatives, both. As we are doing roughly 40 crores to 50 
 Excel Industries Limited 
November 14, 2025 
 
 Page 9 of 12 
crores every year on modernization and maintenance CAPEX, and whatever you s pelled out 
earlier, that is all growth CAPEX. 
Riju Dalui: If I look at your current revenue run rate, so for last maybe 2-3 years, its broadly same I believe 
it is because of the pricing scenarios. So, with the current pricing scenario  how much peak 
revenue we can expect as per the current capacities? 
Ravi Shroff: Revenue  and top line is very, very difficult to answer, nothing specific to mention on top line. 
Riju Dalui: Wanted to understand like the peak revenue potential assuming the pricing of current levels. So, 
just want to understand the revenue potential with the existing assets that we have considering 
the current pricing scenario. 
Ravi Shroff: Currently our capacit y utilization stands at 70 % to 75% . And it's not fully utilized, but for 
chemical plants particularly of our kind of business, 85 % to 90% is considered maximum 
effective utilization due to our product lines and we have to keep some operational flexibility as 
well as periodic maintenance and updates we have to keep some room for. So, that should give 
you an estimate on what is the possibility in terms of headroom and on top of that we have added 
new CAPEX as well which we have shared. 
Moderator: Our next question comes from the line of Jiya Jain with SBA Finance.  
Jiya Jain: I would like to understand how is the domestic demand scenario looking like right now. 
Ravi Shroff: As mentioned Q3 is a lean quarter for us,  combination with extended monsoon, it's  in general 
expected to be a lean quarter. 
Jiya Jain: Are you seeing increased competition from domestic players in any specific molecule or product 
category? 
Ravi Shroff: I can't comment on competition. 
Jiya Jain: Any progress on backward integration opportunity to reduce raw material import dependency? 
Ravi Shroff: As a philosophy, most of our products are backward integrated and typically (Inaudible) 29.42 
products as well. 
Jiya Jain: Are there any geopolitical factors currently affecting sourcing from China or the Middle East? 
Ravi Shroff: Nothing specific impacting us currently. 
Jiya Jain: How do you see the margin trajectory in the coming 2-3 quarters? 
 Excel Industries Limited 
November 14, 2025 
 
 Page 10 of 12 
Ravi Shroff: I have given the indication to an earlier caller as well. Full year, we are expecting 1 3% to 15% 
EBITDA margins as stated earlier. Quarter 3, as I said, would be the lean quarter but Quarter 4, 
there should be some normalization. 
Moderator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Gupta, who's an investor.  
Vivek Gupta: I want to understand more about the current capacity utilization across all the three si tes of the 
company. 
Ravi Shroff: The capacity utilization currently stands at 70% to 75% across the company. 
Vivek Gupta: How was the performance of revenue margin profile of the environmental business compared 
with the chemical segment? 
Ravi Shroff: Performance was stable. Not a big impact overall on the company because it only contributes 
1% to revenues. 
Vivek Gupta: With respect to the recently announced long term contract, is t his agreement expected to open 
new markets or customer segments? 
Ravi Shroff: Our focus is very clear. We have stated earlier as well. We want to reduce our dependence on 
the agrochemical sector.  In that regard, it is helping us reduce the dependence on th e 
agrochemical sector and it's allowing us to access certain opportunities which otherwise we did 
not have access to. 
Moderator: Our next question comes from the line of Dhavan Shah from Alfaccurate Advisors.  
Dhavan Shah: My question is on the contract manufacturing side of the business. What we have seen in the last 
12 months, I think we have seen three contracts which came for the contract manufacturing. And 
this one is one of the big contracts since the last two contracts was roughly 10 crores to 20 crores 
odd. S o, if you can share thoughts,  what kind of size do you look at from the contract 
manufacturing side, maybe two years down the line? And if you can help us to understand about 
the recent contract manufacturing contract, is that from the agrochemical side of the business or 
that is a different product altogether from the spectrum side?  And what is the potential market 
of that product? And is there any further room of incremental opportunity that can also come 
maybe 1-2 years down the line for the same product? 
Ravi Shroff: I can't really comment on size of the ultimate product because we don't have that much visibility 
and data today to give any specific comments on that. Neither can we talk about potential market 
beyond. If you can help me just repeat your question again, because this is what I picked up, but 
I'd like to understand specifically. 
 Excel Industries Limited 
November 14, 2025 
 
 Page 11 of 12 
Dhavan Shah: Basically, the contract manufacturing side of the business, we have seen three deals  in last 12 
months. Basically, how much revenue you are expecting that segment itself can do in next  2-3 
years because there could be another few deals also maybe in the pipeline or maybe you are 
evaluating something on that front. So, if you can help us to understand about that business 
potential maybe 2-3 years down the line.  Right now, your console revenue is roughly 1,000 
crores odd. And this contract manufacturing revenue can be 50 crore s odd at the peak. So, 
roughly 5% is the contribution right now.  This 5% can go up to how much percentage may be 
within next 2-3 years. That’s the first question. 
Ravi Shroff: Roughly around 55 crores to 60 crores is the consolidated revenue at peak. While I can't  give 
you an exact visibility on what level it can go to, I can definitely tell you that when we evaluate 
these opportunities, we look at multiple factors particularly important factors are how do these 
opportunities fit with our capabilities and assets. Also, we have to consider other things such as, 
what are the approvals we have available, etc. , environmental approvals and things like that. 
Plus, we also look at what is the margin profile. It should be margin accretive, EBITDA accretive 
for us. We also look at IRR when we look at such opportunities. And at the end of the day, we 
also have another factor important one which I stated earlier is we want to consciously reduce 
our dependence on the agrochemical sector. So, that is also a factor for us  in terms of looking 
for these opportunities when we particularly look for contract manufacturing opportunities. 
Dhavan Shah: This recent contract is largely from this segment, pharma, polymer, or specialty chemical, you 
mentioned the specialty chemical, so is it the biocide kind of the portfolio or is there anything 
else? 
Ravi Shroff: All three are in the performance solution sector, all three opportunities that we have got. 
Dhavan Shah: But that recent one contract is from which sub-industry if you can help us to understand. 
Ravi Shroff: It's a specialty chemical non-agro. 
Dhavan Shah: You mentioned that FY26 full year margin could be roughly 13 % to 15%. And if I look at  the 
first half operating margin is roughly 12 % odd. You are saying that the 3rd Quarter would be 
lean in terms of the revenue. So, despite that you expect the margin improvement in the second 
half because to achieve that 13% to 15% band, I think you should do at least 14% odd margin in 
the second half. So, is it still achievable based on the revenue trajectory that you are explaining? 
Ravi Shroff: That is an assessment at the moment, as I said, that's what we are saying, that there is a 
possibility. 
Moderator: Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehta from One Up.  
 Excel Industries Limited 
November 14, 2025 
 
 Page 12 of 12 
Ravi Mehta: Since you are trying to move away de -risk from the agrochemical intermediates.  So, any color 
on the R&D pipeline or  the products that you are planning, maybe application -wise are you 
thinking something on the battery chemicals or any other new age applicati ons? If you can just 
throw some light on how you are approaching the R&D and building the pipeline to de -risk the 
business. 
Ravi Shroff: One thing for clarification is we don't want to reduce our agro revenues. 
Ravi Mehta: Of course. On the incremental I am saying. 
Ravi Shroff: As we have also mentioned, our new R&D center is coming up in this quarter itself. Plus,  the 
way we are looking at R&D, we want to make sure that whatever new technologies that are 
required to be added to our existing set of capabili ties, anything else in terms of process 
capabilities, anything else in terms of specific areas of business that we have already mentioned, 
how do we strengthen our position in those areas of business? We are actively  exploring what 
other strengths are required. And along with the new R&D center whatever we require in terms 
of other infrastructure , people as well, we have evaluated all of that to make sure that R&D 
becomes a core pillar of growth. 
Ravi Mehta: Is there any benchmark in terms of complexity of products that you will be looking out for the 
newer products that you would develop in terms of maybe number of steps or maybe some value 
addition type, any benchmarks that you are setting internally just to get a color on how the future 
growth business would look like. 
Ravi Shroff: Preferably, multi -step synthesis where we can backward integrate and there has to be a 
technology asset, some other fit which meets our criteria. As I shared earlier as well, financial 
parameters, IRR contribution profile, all  of those are important parameters for  new product 
selection. 
Moderator: Ladies and gentlemen, In the interest of time, that was the last question for the Q&A session 
today. I now hand the conference over to Ravi for closing comments. 
Ravi Shroff: Thank you once again for joining the call today. Going ahead, we remain optimistic about the 
road ahead. Strategic investments in R&D and sustainability are expected to further strengthen 
our product portfolio along with building strong core business driving long-term growth ahead. 
We continue to stay committed to adhere to the benchmarks of quality established through our 
long-standing heritage.  
Moderator: On behalf of MUFG InTime, that concludes this conference. Thank you for joining us and you 
may now disconnect your lines. Thank you.
