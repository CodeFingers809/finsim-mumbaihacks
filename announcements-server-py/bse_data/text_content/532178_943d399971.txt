Thank you.  
Now, it is over to Ms. Bhoomika. To you. 
Moderator: Sir, we will start with the Q&A. 
Sanjay Jindal: Yes. 
Moderator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question -and-answer session. We take the first 
question from the line of Amit Anwani from BL Capital. Please proceed. 
Amit Anwani: Congratulations for the very strong execution which you have done. Sir, now my first question 
again on execution. We have already done kind of 33% growth for first half to first half, and I 
recollect you guiding about 20% plus for full year growth. Now are we changing then that stance 
 Engineers India Limited 
November 14, 2025 
 
 Page 4 of 16 
since the execution has been quite strong in H1? So, just first thing wanted to understand on the 
guidance.  
 And second, on the order prospects for next six months, we understand that you have won one 
international consulting order again in Africa, which you announced about INR 600+ crore odd. 
And H1 intake is roughly about INR 3,700 crore odd. What is the full year target now, and what 
are the prospective orders? On the execution, are we changing our guidance? 
Sanjay Jindal: For the guidance purpose, in the turnover, we are giving guidance of 25% plus. And we will 
stand by our margins, segment profit of around 25% in the consultancy business. And in the 
LSTK, we will maintain 6% to 7% segment profit. For the rest of the portion, Mr. Vivek Midha 
will answer to you.  
Vivek Midha: Hi, Amit. This is Vivek. 
Amit Anwani: Hi, Vivek. 
Vivek Midha: Just to update you on the business prospects of it , as of today, we have already crossed INR 
4,000 crore. Okay? And we are moving towards our last year's target, INR 8,000 crore. They are 
going to definitely cross that INR 8,000 crore mark and hope to get more than that.  
 Internationally, when you are talking about this project this year, we have been able to secure 
around INR 1,600 crore from overseas. So, this year, in the consultancy segment, overseas has 
contributed more. We are targeting a few major projects more. In months to come, you will hear 
more information on that. At the same time, we are working in the domestic market. So, 
prospects are good. We will definitely cross the last year's mark, and it will go beyond that, 
definitely. 
Amit Anwani: That is great to hear. So, one thing is that you highlighted 1,600 out of 4,000. That is 40%. So, 
are we eyeing for 40%+ consultancy contribution in the 8,000+ order inflow, which you  are 
going to have this year? 
Sanjay Jindal: It would definitely be as part of consultancy. Normally, it remains around 40 % to 50% within 
the consultancy segment. Overall, it would be somewhere around 20% to 25% in the overall. 
Amit Anwani: Second question, I was just observing the revenue from consultancy overseas, which was kind 
of INR 85 crore to INR 100 crore last year, quarterly run rate. And now this year, it is about INR 
70 crore to INR 75 crore quarterly run rate despite the overseas consultancy order book has been 
massive. We won massive orders last year also. So, any particular reason of this not picking up? 
In fact, it has declined, the overseas consultancy revenue this year. 
Sanjay Jindal: Actually, till now, our major client was Dangote Refinery in Nigeria, and we were getting 
turnover from our Mongolia business also. Now these projects are going to be tapered because 
the work has been completed. But since we have got good order in '24-'25 itself in the foreign 
 Engineers India Limited 
November 14, 2025 
 
 Page 5 of 16 
territory, so that business has started execution, taking on. So, we are confident that in the next 
quarter, you will see the results of massive order book in the foreign territory. 
Amit Anwani: And are we targeting the similar 50-50 mix, or since the turnkey was very strong this quarter, so 
what is the mix we are expecting for this year now? 
Sanjay Jindal: On annual basis, it will be 50-50 or 50% to 48% at most. 
Amit Anwani: Lastly, sir, on the losses from associates, I am assuming that this is because of the shutdown in 
Ramagundam. So, just an update on that, because I think H1 basis, the losses have been massive, 
and on the PAT level, the numbers are lower because of that, despite very strong performance. 
We just wanted to understand an update on Ramagundam. 
Sanjay Jindal: In this quarter, Ramagundam project was under shutdown for 45 days out of 90 days. So, in this 
quarter also, we have loss of around INR 25 crore. But in the third quarter, that project plant is 
going well, and we are expecting profit in the third quarter. And we are definitely expecting the 
third quarter will give profits. There were some technical problems, so the plant was under 
shutdown for 45 days in the 2nd Quarter. 
Amit Anwani: Thank you so much for answering the questions. 
Moderator: We take the next question from the line of Mohit Kumar from ICICI Securities. Please proceed. 
Mohit Kumar: Congratulations on a very good quarter. Sir, first question is on the EBIT margin for the 
consultancy. I think this quarter it was 28%. Is there any one-off which we should be aware of? 
Sanjay Jindal: Sir, I could not understand, actually, your question. 
Mohit Kumar: The EBIT margin on the consultancy is 28% during the quarter. Is there any one-off? 
Sanjay Jindal: You are saying about the write back. 
Mohit Kumar: No, no. The margin on the consultancy, EBIT margin. 
Sanjay Jindal: Sir, actually, in this quarter, we have a profit segment of 28%. But if on the half-yearly basis, it 
is around 25%. We are sure that we will be able to secure our margin of around 25% on overall 
basis in the consultancy segment. And in the LSTK segment, we are maintaining the segment 
profit of 6% to 7%. 
Mohit Kumar: Sir, any outlook on the domestic consultancy order inflow or pipeline? There was an IOCL 
Paradip Phase-2 project. Is the tender out? 
Sanjay Jindal: Mr. Vivek Midha will answer.  
 Engineers India Limited 
November 14, 2025 
 
 Page 6 of 16 
Vivek Midha: With respect to the IOCL Paradip, there is no tender is going to come out. We are in the Phase-
1 of execution. As soon as the Phase-1 is completed, they will have their management approval, 
and they will proceed with the Phase-2. Now, both the phases have been awarded to us. It is that 
we will get the work order for the Phase-2 subsequently when the Phase-1 is completed. So, 
Phase-1 is progressing at this point of time. It is not in our hand. 
Mohit Kumar: Is it right to say that Phase-1 was merely INR 100 crore worth of project, and Phase-2 will be 
much, much larger? If I am not wrong, it should be around INR 900 crore. Will it be booked in 
this fiscal year, the balance Phase-2, or next year, next fiscal? 
Vivek Midha: It should come towards the end of this fiscal year. Towards the end, it should come. Because the 
Phase-1 is in progress, and we are going to submit the reports, the study reports, and then they 
will take the Board approval and then Board decide on the proceeding on the job. So, we are 
hopeful that by the end of this financial year, it should be done. Phase-1 should be done, and 
they should get the clearance. O r otherwise, it would be early next financial year it should be 
awarded. 
Mohit Kumar: Sir, any other large domestic pipeline order, domestic ordering pipeline which we are looking at 
in H2 or FY '27? 
Vivek Midha: You have this Andhra refinery which is going on. We are working on this feasibility study. 
Hopefully, the second phase, if this study is accepted, then they will come with the 
implementation phase. Similarly, there is a petrochemical complex, AGCPL. They are thinking 
of expansion. Their tender could come. There could be some small specialty chemical projects. 
There are various studies that have been done by IOCL, and they are thinking of implementing 
the various speci alty chemical projects. So, those are expected to come in times too in this 
financial year. 
Moderator: We take the next question from the line of Prateek from IntelSense, please proceed. 
Prateek: My question was on the write -back that we have done. I think about INR 35 crores of write-
back. Can you, sir, give a light on as to which project this was and when was the provision 
actually made in the past for this INR 35 crore amount? 
Sanjay Jindal: Actually, this provision relates to one of our projects, Dangote Refinery in Nigeria. That 
provision is kept for our defect liability period. Whenever this defect liability period is over, 
client releases our bank guarantee, and then provision is reversed. So, client is reversing our 
bank guarantee in the piecemeal basis. So, in this quarter, we have got the provision reverse of 
INR 35 crore based on the reduced liability on this project. 
Prateek: And s ir, like you said, it  is on a piecemeal basis , so i s there any other amount that you are 
expected to receive on this? 
 Engineers India Limited

 Page 7 of 16 
Sanjay Jindal: A small portion is balance. That will be released in the due course of time, maybe in this quarter 
or next quarter. 
Prateek: Sir, one last question. Sir, in our last con call, you had mentioned that there were several projects 
which were in advance negotiation stage. So, in this quarter orders, have those materialized or 
still we are expecting those kind of orders? 
Sanjay Jindal: You can see our order book of INR 13,000 crore. Definitely, some of the orders have been 
matured. And in this quarter, we have already got the order of INR 3,700 crore. So, definitely, 
our efforts are fruitful, and we have got some of the orders. 
Moderator: We take the next question from the line of Saket Kapoor from Kapoor & Co. Please proceed. 
Saket Kapoor: Firstly, sir, we were also looking for some diversification in terms of moving away from the oil 
refinery space and then looking for the  hydrogen opportunity going ahead. So, sir, where are 
we? There is some work was also done earlier, which were informed in some forum by the MD. 
Correct me there, sir, if I am with the information. 
Vivek Midha: With respect to the, see, diversification, definitely, we have done diversification in this segment. 
We have moved out of, basically, the hydrocarbon. Today, our infrastructure business is almost 
more than the hydrocarbon business. That is a major diversification.  
 With respect to the new areas, which we have talked about, like this hydrogen is done and coal 
gasification is done and bio refinery is done. So, bio refinery, you know  that we have already 
done one bio refinery, bamboo -based bio refinery. Recently, we have been awarded one 
assignment for coal gasification from the coal to SNG by NTPC. That assignment we just got 
now which we are executing. We are anticipating this kind of assignments from other clients 
also. We are in the bidding process for various projects of this sort. 
Saket Kapoor: Sir, when we look at our capital investment in the various JVs, Ramagundam Fertilizer is there. 
Then, sir, we have a small stake in the Numaligarh Refinery also. What has been the contribution, 
if any, in terms of any dividend and how is the performance there? I think so, our major 
investment is for this 4% stake to the tune of INR 830 crore. 
R.P. Batra: Yes, it will be coming in the next quarter. NRL dividend will be coming in the next quarter. So, 
they are basically in the expansion phase. So, they are giving the limited dividend. In the last 
financial year, they have given the substantial dividend. But going forward, they are investing 
the money for their new project. So, whatever dividend they have declared for the last financial 
year, that will be coming in the next quarter. 
Saket Kapoor: So, what was the amount, sir, last year? How much we have received? 
R.P. Batra: In this year, around INR 20 crore will be coming. 
 Engineers India Limited 
November 14, 2025 
 
 Page 8 of 16 
Saket Kapoor: And, sir, any step, we will hold on to this minority stake of 4%. In the total real m of things, we 
are only holding 4% of the entity. Or we can also look forward for divesting this stake? 
Sanjay Jindal: Actually, at this moment, we have percentage of 4.37%. And whenever opportunity comes, we 
will review it. 
Saket Kapoor: And also, sir, we have two upstream assets investment also under NELP IX. So, already, you 
have mentioned that during the bi dding stage, there was the project cost was envisaged at INR 
300 crore, as mentioned in the presentation. So, we have not invested anything on these assets  
as of now. 
Sanjay Jindal: No, we are not investing any further. Basically, whatever investment was done, is done. So, we 
are not anticipating any further investment in this block. 
Saket Kapoor: And lastly, sir, with the reversal of this INR 35 crore because of the Nigerian no defect project, 
which you mentioned to the early participant, that means net of that has moved up the profit by 
that amount. So, we need to factor in that number in terms of the profit profitability. That is the... 
Sanjay Jindal: Actually, reversal of provision is a continuous process. Because provisions are reversed 
whenever defect liability period of the projects is over. So, it is a routine business for EIL. Some 
of the provisions are created and some of the provisions are reversed. So, this is not a cause of 
worry for EIL. 
Saket Kapoor: What is the net of impact? How much provision we have made, if any, for this quarter or for the 
first term? And how much have been reversed in totality? 
Sanjay Jindal: For this quarter, it is reverse d on overall basis, I think it is minus 12. But in the last quarter, it 
was on positive side. So, sometimes it is on positive side, sometimes it is on negative side. 
Sanjay Jindal: As per contractual provision, we create the provision, and as per the contractual provision, we 
write back the provision. So, this is a continuous process over the tenure of the project. The 
provisions are created when the project is completed, and in case any liability does not come, 
we reverse that. So, it is basically a continuous process. 
Sanjay Jindal: In the coming time, some more projects are going to be closed or defect liability period is going 
to be over. So, it is a continuous process. 
Saket Kapoor: And sir, lastly, on the cash, on the books, and what steps are we taking? How can we create 
value through that cash, through sharing with investors? Or what is the best possible way? What 
is the closing balance, the cash balance we have? And how are you looking forward to deploy 
the same? 
Sanjay Jindal: Currently, all the cash is being deployed as per DPE guidelines, and we are constantly looking 
for the investment opportunity where the CapEx are lower, and standalone facility. Whenever 
 Engineers India Limited 
November 14, 2025 
 
 Page 9 of 16 
we get a good opportunity, definitely, EIL management will consider for the investment of the 
same, like NRL and RFCL. And we are constantly looking for that. 
Saket Kapoor: Closing balance, sir, can you confirm? Cash on cash and books? 
Sanjay Jindal: It is between INR 900 crore to INR 1,000 crore. 
Moderator: We take the next question from the line of S Ramesh, an individual. Please proceed. 
S Ramesh: So, if you look at the split between the turnkey and the consulting income, so if your turnkey 
revenue share is higher, it is a drag on your margin s, right? You are talking about single -digit 
margin. So, as a strategy, how do you view the split between the two revenue streams from 
consulting and turnkey? And how do you see your overall strategic  objective of maintaining 
ROCE for the business based on this blend? 
Sanjay Jindal: Actually, it is definitely, we have more segment profit in consultancy segment and less in LSTK 
business segment. But in the Indian economy, there is limitations on the consultancy business, 
because at one times, mega projects are not more than two or three. So, whenever we are having 
opportunity in India, in the consultancy business, definitely, we are grabbing it, and w e are 
expanding our footprints in international market also for the consultancy business. And with the 
balance manhour, we are doing the LSTK job, so that we can have a good turnover, as well as 
good bottom line also. And as a strategy, we are trying to maintain consultancy business around 
minimum 50%. 
S Ramesh: So, basically, you are saying that overall, you will be able to sustain your ROC E based on the 
top line growth and the cash flows. Is that the right way to understand? 
Sanjay Jindal: Basically, LSTK gives the top line, but consultancy gives the bottom line. So, we are striking a 
balance between the two. 
S Ramesh: So, in terms of the accounting in turnkey projects, in terms of you book the income, is there any 
Ind AS impact? And what is the percentage booking you do in terms of the overall timeline for 
the turnkey revenue? 
Sanjay Jindal: Actually, in the turnkey business, turnover is coming on cost progress basis. It is not based upon 
the timing or billing. Once we get the project, the whole turnover is booked within the three to 
four years, because a mega project takes minimum three to four years, and that is the timeline 
for the mega consultancy, as well as LSTK projects. 
S Ramesh: So, in terms of your investment holding, you are getting about 12% return , if you look at the 
other income, the value of the investment in the standalone numbers . So, is there any strategic 
rationale for holding on to these investments in Ramagundam Fertilizers, for example, or the 
other companies? Even that the returns are not really what you would expect from equity 
investments. So, what is the management thought process on the equity investments? You expect 
 Engineers India Limited 
November 14, 2025 
 
 Page 10 of 16 
the returns to go up in future? Or is there a thought process in terms of exiting some of the 
investments which may not be productive? 
Sanjay Jindal: Actually, I think Ramagundam project, Ramagundam is a very good investment, because India 
is filling short of urea, and Ramagundam is able to generate minimum profits of INR 500 crore 
on annual basis. But we are facing some technical problems. That's why project is going for the 
shutdown on time to time basis. But we have sorted out the issue, and in the next quarter itself, 
in this quarter itself, the plant will generate the profit. So, this is not a question of worry for EIL, 
because our investment is safe in the Ramagundam project. 
Moderator: We take the next question from the line of Mohit Kumar from ICICI Securities. Please proceed. 
Mohit Kumar: Sir, the question is, Ramagundam, I think, was making profit for last couple of years, right? So, 
what has happened in last two quarters? The losses have been  in the first quarter was INR 8  
crore, I think, 2nd Quarter is only widened, right? So, is it fair to expect that from Q3 onwards, 
you could start seeing a normal profit? Or do you think this will continue for some more time? 
Sanjay Jindal: Actually, we are facing some problem in stabilization, and definitely, you are right, in the first 
quarter, there was shutdown, and in the 2nd Quarter, there was shutdown also for the 45 days. 
But now, we have sorted out the problem, and now plant is running well. And definitely, we are 
going to get profit in this quarter. 
Mohit Kumar: Second question is on the order intake guidance for the full year. I think we spoke, I think, we 
have guided for broadly INR 8,000 crore kind of order intake. Is it fair to assume that PMC will 
be close to INR 5,000 crore order inflow for the entire fiscal? Or will it be a lower number? 
Sanjay Jindal: You are talking about the order inflow for… 
Mohit Kumar: Order inflow for the entire Fiscal Year ' 26. Out of INR 8,000 crore, how much could be the 
consultancy order inflow? 
Sanjay Jindal: Out of INR 8,000 crore, it could be definitely, consultancy will be somewhere around 50%.  
Mohit Kumar: INR 4,000 crore. 
Sanjay Jindal: It is typically, we maintain will be balance of 50-50. Sometimes, it is 40%, 55%, 46%. It depends, 
but remains in this range itself. 
Mohit Kumar: Sir, last year, consultancy was very good, I think, we did INR 4,500 crore. So, asking whether 
we can cross that number, or do you think it will be lower than that number? 
Vivek Midha: We can.  
Sanjay Jindal: We definitely can.

Mohit Kumar: And on the international side, I think the size of orders are, I think, start getting slightly bigger. 
What is the size of orders, the large orders in the pipeline, in the inquiry pipeline, or in the 
tendering stage? Is the pipeline growing, or is the pipeline only small, small orders, orders will 
come in bits and pieces? 
Vivek Midha: No, it is a mix of pipeline. We are working in Abu Dhabi. We are working as an engineering 
consultant with a number of companies. We have running long-term agreements with them. We 
get various smaller assignment jobs under that. We also get the bigger assignment job, bigger 
size jobs under that, means INR 300 crore, INR 400 crore.  
 It depends, but we cater to all kind of jobs. We want to grab maximum, so that our order is 
maintained. So, we maintain the mix of that, because the smaller assignments have a smaller 
period, but it gives you good revenue. The bigger assignments have more execution. It is a longer 
execution period. So, that is one of the opportunity, but it is a mix of both. 
Moderator: We take the next question from the line of Anupam Goswami from SUD Life. Please proceed. 
Anupam Goswami: Sir, on the consultancy order that we won, the large order, what is our timeline of execution for 
that? On the whole overall order book, how do you take it on the margin front, and the execution 
timeline for the whole order book as well? 
Vivek Midha: Typically, any bigger project will have a time schedule of 36 to 48 months. So, specifically, this 
project, which we have won, it is around 36 months. So, this turnover would be divided into, 
basically, the recovery would be in three years' time.  
Sanjay Jindal: In the first year, any new project gives only 10 % to 15% turnover. And in the second and third 
year, it gives 25% to 30% turnover. And in the fourth year, it gives 15% to 20% turnover. This 
is the general trend. 
Anupam Goswami: I will join back in the queue. 
Moderator: We take the next question from the line of Rajesh Agarwal, an individual investor. Please 
proceed.  
Rajesh Agarwal: Sir, how much we have invested in Ramagundam project, and what can be the annualized normal 
profits, if everything is okay? 
Sanjay Jindal: We have invested around INR 491 crore in Ramagundam project. And when everything is okay, 
it will generate minimum INR 500 crore profit, and our share will be 26%. 
Rajesh Agarwal: 26%. Okay. And now, things are normalized, sir, there? 
Sanjay Jindal: Yes, things are normalized. Plant is running well.

Rajesh Agarwal: Sir, one question. I want to understand on the write-back. Suppose, this quarter, we have written 
back INR 35 crores. So, net-net, how do we understand that how much we have written back? 
Some provisions must have been made for the other orders also. 
Sanjay Jindal: Actually, we have written back a figure of INR 35  crores. Actually, as per contract, provisions 
are being made, and whenever our defect liability period is over, we reverse the provision for 
that particular project. So, in this quarter, we have reversed the one of the major project amount, 
INR 35 crore, and we have made some provisions also. But overall impact is negative. 
Rajesh Agarwal: Negative mean negative of how much? INR 12 crores. 
Sanjay Jindal: 12 crores. 
Rajesh Agarwal: INR 12 crore less we have provided. 
Sanjay Jindal: 12 crore we have reversed, because provision is made there. 
Rajesh Agarwal: Okay, INR 12 crore. 
Sanjay Jindal: Provision is reversed more. And sometimes, it is created, it is positive. Sometimes, it is negative. 
It depends upon the... 
Rajesh Agarwal: So, without reversal, what is the EBITDA in the consultancy business margin? 
Sanjay Jindal: So, part of EBITDA, part of operating profit. 
Rajesh Agarwal: Consultancy EBITDA will be how much, separately? 25%? 
R.P Batra: Basically, it's a segment result, we are publishing.  
Sanjay Jindal: The segment profit is 28% in this quarter on the consultancy business. 
Rajesh Agarwal: And how is the order outlook, sir? Future order outlook? 
Vivek Midha: Order outlook is good. W e will be touching more than 8,000. We are working towards it. W e 
will meet the last year target, and order book has already exceeded with respect to the last month. 
So, it is further going to increase. Let's hope for the best. 
Rajesh Agarwal: What can we annualized run rate in the turnover, including both turnkey and consultancy? INR 
6,000 crore? 
Sanjay Jindal: 8,000, annualized turnover? Our analyzed turnover for the last year is INR 3,000 crore, and we 
are expecting more than 25% growth in this year. So, it may be around INR 3,800  crore, INR 
3,900 crore.

Moderator: The next question is from the line of Samarth Khandelwal from ICICI Securities. Please proceed.  
Samarth Khandelwal: Sir, could you share some color on how our order inflow trajectory is from domestic markets 
and international market? 
Sanjay Jindal: Domestic, we have told you that this year, as of now, we have booked the order worth of INR 
4,000 crore, out of which approximately around INR 1,500 crore or INR 1,800 crore is from the 
LSTK segment. Rest is from the consultancy . And consultancy, we have overseas, has 
contributed more than INR 1,680 crore. 
Samarth Khandelwal: And going forward, how do you see it to be? 
Sanjay Jindal: We will be going towards the last year ’s figure of INR 8,000 crore. We should cross that. We 
are already on INR 4,000 crore as of now. 
Samarth Khandelwal: Sir, I meant, do we see more opportunities in the international versus domestic, or how is it? Is 
it balanced from both the… 
Vivek Midha: International has lot of opportunities. We are focusing on the international market aggressively. 
At the same time, domestic market also has opportunities. We are working on them. It is like 
that, sometimes, the activities, some of the contracts, major contracts, we were negotiating, has 
been concluded. Some more, we are discussing. It could get realized by the end of this financial 
year. 
Samarth Khandelwal: That is very helpful. 
Moderator: We take the next question from the line of Saket Kapoor from Kapoor & Co. Please proceed. 
Saket Kapoor: Only a small clarification. Since we are having this equity investment in Ramagundam 
Fertilizers, so, these are only book entries that we have to pass through with respect to the equity 
holding we have. So, even if the company reports the estimated profits, which you have been 
explaining, we will be again booking only book profits. It is only when they declare dividend. 
Yes, please correct me, sir.  
Sanjay Jindal: On the consolidated front, we are consolidating only bottom line figure. Turnover is not being 
included in the EIL turnover, and RFCL has not started the dividend yet. Whenever dividend 
will be declared, that will be taken into other income. 
Saket Kapoor: Sir, my question was whatever losses of profit, which we are booking because of our equity 
investment, are only the book entries. There is no actual cash impact on that. 
Sanjay Jindal: That is a part of our consolidated results. Whenever they will declare the dividend, that will 
come into the company and will be shown as other income in the standalone financial.

Saket Kapoor: As of now, there is, I mean, one can understand that whatever INR 491 crore we have invested, 
that is the equity as we hold in our stock market. There is no return as of now, till they start 
releasing out any cash. That is what the understanding is.  
Sanjay Jindal: Whatever loss in RFCL, that is being offset with our profit on the consolidated basis. Equity is 
intact.  
Saket Kapoor: Sir, we are not getting any advantage from the losses. Are the tax liability on our consolidated 
number get reduced because of those, or they are only the book entry?  
Sanjay Jindal: Nothing.  
Saket Kapoor: Nothing. So, that is what my question is. Other than that, this is only a book entry. It has no other 
reference as such.  
Sanjay Jindal: Yes, book entry for the consolidated financial. In the standalone, there is no entry, because it  is 
a temporary loss. In case, if it was a permanent loss, then entry has to be provided. 
Saket Kapoor: Sir, we have also participated in the rights issue for NRL also in the first quarter. So, we have 
retained our stake only, and is our stake diluted to what extent?  
Sanjay Jindal: We are maintaining our percentage, and based upon that, whatever right issue is there, we have 
subscribed that. 
Moderator: We take the next question from the line of Anupam Goswami from SUD Life. Please proceed.  
Anupam Goswami: Sir, if you can give us a little color on the whole oil and gas CapEx in the near term, and how is 
it in the domestic, as well as in international, and where are we targeting in our outlook? 
Vivek Midha: if you see that BPCL is investing in the refining and petrochemical complex . Investment is 
around INR 95,000 crore. Similarly, the Barmer Refinery, which was there, it is around INR 
72,000 crore. IOCL in all has invested around INR 1.66 lakh crore in various projects, various 
refinery projects. MENA is investing INR 50,000 crore.  
 Similarly, you have this ONGC Gujarat Jamnagar. They are also investing. They are thinking of 
the Petchem project there. It is around INR 8 0,000 crore to INR 1,000 crore. Smaller various 
independent refineries could be there, somewhere around INR 1.25 lakh crores and also.  
 So, there are a lot of opportunities are there. Many studies have been done in past, and those are 
still under consideration with the clients. So, if they get materialized, let's hope for the best. It 
should be implemented. 
 Also, there has been some issues with respect to this, the tariff issue, which is going on. So, some 
of the private ventures  were to set up the Petchem plants, based on the imported ethane, they

have got stalled. Until the time this tariff issue is resolved, it will take some time to settle. When 
this tariff issue is resolved, hopefully, it should get resolved. And t hen we should see those 
investment getting realized in times to come. 
Moderator: We take the next question from the line of Mohit Kumar from ICICI Securities. Please proceed. 
Mohit Kumar: My first question is on the, do you think there will be a dilution on the consultancy margin due 
to rising international mix? Or is it fair to expect that we will maintain that band of 22% to 25% 
margin in the consultancy? 
Sanjay Jindal: On overall basis, in the domestic as well as international projects, we are maintaining our margin 
of 22%-25%, and we are expected to maintain it. 
Mohit Kumar: Sir, will there be any impact of pay commission on next year consultancy margins? 
Sanjay Jindal: That provision we are already taken in the account. So, as on the date, there will not be any 
impact on the financials of the company, but definitely, whenever it will be higher, then that will 
be looked into. 
Mohit Kumar: Last question, Andhra BPCL project, has the location been zeroed in, and can we expect the next 
stage of tendering in the next fiscal? 
Vivek Midha: It should be towards the end of this financial year, or early next year. The study is on, study we 
are doing it, so that at the point of time, they are deciding the configuration and some 
environmental impact assessment studies are being on. So, by the end of that study, they will 
take a decision and take the management approval. This decision they will take to implement 
that project. So, it should happen towards the end of this financial year or early next financial 
year. 
Moderator: We take the next question from the line of Prateek Dugar from Intelsense. Please proceed. 
Prateek Dugar: Sir, you mentioned about the oil and gas CapEx. And among this, sir, large figures that we hear, 
what would be the opportunity side that would be for EIL actually? 
Vivek Midha: Everything, all the figures which we see are the opportunity for us. But it is a competitive world. 
We will be bidding for them, and we get some. But these are the started opportunity. They are 
not coming in one way, because it  is a large investment. Many of the projects will come in the 
phases. So, we are anticipating that we should be getting good business out of it. 
Prateek Dugar: So, sir, my understanding is that, for these projects, whatever is like the construction, we are 
handling mostly the consultancy part, or when we take up the turnkey, how are we bidding for 
that, sir? 
 Engineers India Limited

Vivek Midha: No, any of the projects, these, the figures, which we have told, is the total CapEx part, which 
includes the cost of the land and various other costs, including the cost of the plant. Consultancy 
is a very smaller part of it. So, we primarily focus on the consultancy services. We don’t get into 
the construction. We are the consultant. We get into the concept to commissioning of that 
project, starting from the studies to implementation of the same. We get the work done through 
the contractors.  
 So, we work as basically owner's engineers or a project management consultant, whichever way 
you say. We are basically the extended arm of the client in implementing that project. But 
construction is done by somebody else, the specialized consultant or the EPC contractors. We 
are not into the business of construction. 
Prateek Dugar: So, just like as a thumb rule, I mean, what would be the percentage of consultancy for a given, 
say, project cost? Can we get a guidance on like what would be the thumb rule for some 
percentage figure of the total cost of the project? 
Sanjay Jindal: It all depends in which mode it is being executed, because it could be, if you  see the larger 
project, it could be 2 %-3%. Our service could be 1 % or 2%, 3%, depending on the size of the 
project. These are the just overall cost, which are available in the market. If you talk about 1 
lakh crore of the project, it is not actually the complete, the cost on which we will be getting the 
consultancy. We will be getting the consultancy services on the base, on the plant and machinery 
cost of it. So, if you see, the overall project cost will be 1% or 2% or 3%. Depends. 
Moderator: Thank you. As there are no further questions from the participants, I would now like to hand the 
conference over to the management for closing comments. Over to you, sir. 
Sanjay Jindal: Thank you.  
Moderator: Thank you. On behalf of DAM Capital Advisors Limited, that concludes this conference. Thank 
you for joining us, and you may now just disconnect your lines.
