At Mindspace REIT , we believe great workspaces are more than just buildings—they are 
ecosystems where ideas thrive, businesses grow, and people feel inspired. Over the past five 
years since our listing, we have remained committed to building loved workspaces that not only 
support enterprise but also enhance well-being and create lasting value for stakeholders.
Client experience lies at the core of all our developments. Every campus is thoughtfully 
designed with curated amenities, hospitality-driven services, and modern design elements 
that create dynamic, vibrant work environments. By embedding wellness, convenience, and 
community into the workplace, we elevate experiences for both occupiers and their people.
This philosophy has shaped our strategy; consolidating in core markets through strategic 
acquisitions, rejuvenating assets like Airoli, and making entry into prime hubs such as 
Hyderabad’s financial district.
These numbers validate the enduring preference for Mindspace campuses and the long-term value we continue to unlock.
As we mark five years of listing, the essence of our journey lies in balancing work with wellness, growth with resilience, and 
value with vision. Loved by occupiers, trusted by stakeholders, and shaped by a forward-looking strategy, Mindspace REIT 
continues to be the ecosystem where businesses can truly think big.

Our Expansion Strategy
PILLAR
India has become a preferred office destination for  multinational corporations 
(MNCs) due to a robust economy, skilled workforce, and thriving digital 
ecosystem. This shift is driving an unprecedented demand for Grade-A office 
spaces, especially in key business hubs where global companies are setting up 
Global Capability Centers (GCCs) and expanding their operations.
To meet these evolving needs, we take an insight-driven approach to organic development. By understanding market 
dynamics and tenant preferences, we focus on functional design, collaborative spaces, and market-aligned development 
strategies. This ensures that our office spaces remain competitive, adaptable, and in step with industry trends.

Acquisitions
Expanding Scale with 
Acquisitions and Execution
Over the years, Mindspace REIT has shown strength in balancing 
organic development with value-driven acquisitions. Development builds 
a strong foundation, while acquisitions enable us to scale efficiently, 
diversify the portfolio, and deliver sustained returns, reinforcing our long-
term commitment to quality and tenant-centric growth.
Acquisition of The Square 110, Financial District (Erstwhile Q-city) 
Mindspace REIT expanded its presence in Hyderabad’s Financial District with the acquisition of Q-City, a premium office 
campus offering approximately 0.81 Mn sq. ft. of leasable area. The acquisition was completed through Horizonview 
Properties Private Limited, SPV of Mindspace Business Parks REIT , via a 100% equity purchase in Mack Soft Tech Private 
Limited. Horizonview properties private limited has acquired the shares from seller’s entities viz. Mack Soft Resolution 
Company Limited and Quinn Finance Unlimited Company. Fully debt-funded, the transaction was closed on July 23, 2025 
at a gross consideration (enterprise value) of ` 4,957  Mn, reflecting an 11.6% discount to the asset’s independent valuation 
of  5,608 Mn. With this addition, Mindspace REIT’s portfolio in Hyderabad has extended to nearly 16 Mn sq. ft. The asset 
has been rebranded as ‘The Square 110, Financial District’ post the acquisition.

Sustainability-linked Bond Issuance
Pioneering Sustainable 
Financing
We marked another milestone in sustainable financing with the issuance of our second 
tranche of ` 5,500 Mn Sustainability-Linked Bonds. The bond structure links our financing 
cost to the achievement of predefined sustainability targets — reinforcing our commitment 
to measurable environmental performance. This initiative further strengthens our position 
as a responsible issuer and broadens investor participation, attracting a diverse mix of 
mutual funds, insurance companies, and institutional investors.
Reflecting our Financial Strength and 
Long-term Environmental Responsibility
During the year, we marked another milestone in sustainable 
financing by raising ` 5,500 Mn through our Sustainability-Linked 
Bond issuance from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), 
the private sector investment arm of the World Bank Group. This 
issuance marks a landmark moment in India’s real estate sector, as 
the first SLB issuance by an Indian REIT under the new Environment, 
Social and Governance (ESG) framework introduced by the 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), under the SEBI 
circular dated June 05, 2025 titled ‘Framework for Environment, 
Social and Governance (ESG) Debt Securities (other than green debt 
securities)’ (SEBI ESG Circular).
The bond structures link our financing costs to the achievement of 
predefined sustainability targets, underscoring our commitment to 
responsible growth and measurable environmental impact.
This takes our total sustainability-linked fundraising to ` 12,000 Mn, 
including the ` 6,500 Mn raised last year. In addition, we had 
previously raised ` 5,500 Mn through Green Bonds. Our total 
outstanding green and sustainability-linked financing now stands at 
` 21,639 Mn.
How are sustainability-linked bonds 
different from green bonds?
Sustainability-linked bonds differ from green bonds as they 
are tied to the achievement of specific Environmental, Social, 
and Governance (ESG) targets. In contrast, green bonds are 
restricted to financing eco-friendly projects. Sustainability-linked 
bonds incentivise sustainability efforts by linking financial terms 
to the issuer’s performance on predefined goals. These goals 
include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving energy 
efficiency and improving green footprint.

Progress through Environmental 
Responsibility
Commitment to Resource Efficiency
We recognise the critical role of natural resources in property development. With this awareness, we advance 
sustainable practices and responsible resource use. Our initiatives in energy, water, and waste management 
improve efficiency while reinforcing our commitment to environmental stewardship.
Adopting Renewable Energy 
By September 2025, renewable energy contributed 
47.8% of total operational energy consumption 
(developer scope), up significantly from 40.2% in 
FY25. On a like-to-like basis (excluding two new assets 
added in FY26), the renewable energy mix stood at 
54.0%, reflecting strong progress in clean energy 
transition across comparable assets. Green power used 
Total rooftop solar PV Installation capacity
2.23 MW
Fresh Air Provision
30% Extra
Sustainability for us begins with renewable energy. Here is 
how we turn this commitment into action:
These efforts lessen the environmental impact and 
redefine sustainability standards within the real estate 
sector. As of H1 FY26, our rooftop solar capacity stands 
at 2.23 MW, generating 1,115 MWh of renewable energy 
during the first half of the fiscal year.
Water and Wastewater 
Management
Managing water wisely remains central to our 
sustainability agenda, supported by the following actions:
  We recycle and reuse treated water as part of our 
commitment to sustainable water management
  Recycled water is rigorously tested to uphold strict 
standards of safety and purity
  Advanced sewage treatment plant (STP) technology 
has raised water quality and improved operational 
efficiency
Sustainable Waste Practices
We minimise our footprint by embedding waste reduction 
into construction activities. At Mindspace REIT’s business 
parks, sustainable waste management covers composting 
for landscaping, centralised treatment, on-site reuse, and 
tenant participation. We also focus on reducing single-
use plastic and achieving 100% wet waste reuse. These 
actions reflect our responsibility to conserve resources 
while protecting the environment. 
Policy for Construction Waste
We comply fully with legal requirements to ensure 
responsible waste management and pollution prevention. 
By aligning our approach with UN Sustainable 
Development Goal 12: Responsible Consumption 
and Production, we strengthen our commitment to 
sustainability and minimise environmental impact.
Our Construction Waste Management Policy, developed 
as per the Construction Waste Management Law 
2025, provides a structured system to handle, reduce, 
reuse, and dispose of waste responsibly. It minimises 
environmental impact, ensures full compliance with 
regulatory requirements, and improves resource efficiency 
through responsible consumption. This integrated 
approach embeds sustainability into construction and 
reinforces our long-term commitment to environmental 
stewardship.
K Raheja Corp and Mindspace REIT have adopted 
Whole Building Life Cycle Assessment (WBLCA) to 
reduce embodied environmental impacts in line with 
LEED v4.1 standards. At KRC Infra B4, interventions 
such as using 40% GGBS in concrete, 15% recycled 
steel and 30% recycled aluminium achieved a 10% 
reduction in GWP and earned 3 LEED points. This 
approach demonstrates our commitment to material 
efficiency, sustainable construction, and climate 
resilience through data-driven practices.

Social Commitment 
in Action
Stepathon Challenge 2025
To strengthen employee wellness, we launched a 41-day 
Stepathon Challenge across locations. Employees tracked 
daily steps through fitness devices and mobile apps. The 
initiative encouraged physical activity and built a culture of 
workplace fitness.
The initiative not only encouraged physical fitness but 
also strengthened camaraderie and engagement across 
the workforce. It further supported mental well-being by 
inspiring healthier routines, reducing sedentary habits, 
and encouraging group participation.
Through such wellness programmes, we advance our 
ESG agenda under the ‘Social’ pillar. We believe that a 
healthy workforce drives collaboration, raises productivity, 
and ensures long-term organisational sustainability.
Technology-enabled Workspaces
Digital Resilience with WiredScore 
We are pursuing WiredScore certification for KRIT B8 
to benchmark the building’s digital infrastructure and 
resilience. This globally recognised rating assures tenants 
of strong connectivity, robust internet reliability, and 
workplaces designed for the future. It also strengthens our 
ESG focus on innovation, tenant well-being, and smart 
infrastructure.
Innovation through SmartScore
KRIT B8 is also being advanced for SmartScore 
certification, reflecting our commitment to intelligent, 
technology-enabled workspaces. The rating confirms 
our focus on sustainability, digital security, and user 
experience, while positioning us against global 
benchmarks for ESG-driven innovation.
ESG Workshops
IGBC AP Workshop 2.0 
Building on last year’s successful workshop, we continued 
to advance green expertise across our teams. In H1 
FY26, 200+ team members registered for the CII–Indian 
Green Building Council (IGBC) Accredited Professional 
(AP) examination, further strengthening our capabilities in 
sustainable building practices.
Stakeholder’s Consultant Meet 2.0
We organised a second consecutive brainstorming session 
with MEP and sustainability consultants, aimed at creating 
unified sustainability guidelines for future projects. More 
than 10 consultants and certification bodies participated, 
encouraging dialogue, idea exchange, and deeper 
collaboration. This initiative reduces design conflicts, 
ensures smoother execution, and demonstrates our 
commitment to responsible practices and ESG integration.
Maharashtra Energy Conservation 
Building Code Rule (ECBC) Workshop 
T o foster energy-efficient construction, we hosted a 
workshop on the ECBC. The session brought together 
architects, consultants, and other stakeholders to 
understand compliance requirements and best practices 
for improving building performance. This initiative advances 
SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy and SDG 13: Climate 
Action, while embedding sustainable development into our 
projects.
Celebrating Community through 
Family Day
To build community and celebrate diversity, we hosted 
Family Day with the theme ‘Travel around the World’. 
Employees and their families enjoyed interactive activities, 
cultural performances, and global cuisines. The event 
fostered stronger employee–family bonds and reinforced 
our commitment to inclusivity and well-being under the 
Social pillar.
Tenant ESG Collaboration Forum
Mindspace REIT conducted a T enant ESG Collaboration 
Forum to strengthen engagement and promote collective 
sustainability action. The forum focused on opportunities for 
Green Power procurement, Green Leasing, and enhanced 
ESG collaboration. Mindspace also initiated data sharing on 
energy performance and introduced a template to capture 
tenant-led ESG initiatives.

Evaluation Criteria: 
We measured suppliers across seven areas: legal 
compliance, business integrity, pollution management, 
resource efficiency, climate change, labour practices, 
and occupational health and safety. Each was rated from 
zero (no measures) to three (comprehensive policies). 
Scores captured incremental progress and were 
averaged for a final result.
Objective:
Our aim was to conduct annual ESG assessments 
of critical suppliers to ensure compliance and steady 
improvement.
Findings:
While most suppliers satisfied the basic requirements, 
gaps remained, especially in climate-related measures 
and environmental management.
Conclusion: 
Advancing sustainability practices and compliance 
requires stronger focus in environmental areas. Ongoing 
efforts are key to achieving full alignment with ESG 
standards.

Human Rights Due  
Diligence
At Mindspace REIT , protecting and promoting human 
rights is central to our business philosophy. We conduct 
annual Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) across 
all assets to ensure ethical, fair, and safe workplaces. 
In FY25, we undertook human rights assessments at 
our Gera Commerzone Kharadi, Pune, covering both 
operational and under-construction sites, following an 
independent third-party HRDD in FY24. The assessment 
benchmarked our practices against international 
frameworks such as the UDHR, UNGC, ILO, OECD, 
and UNGPs, and involved detailed reviews, employee 
engagement, and site-level evaluations. Focus areas 
included labour standards, collective bargaining, non-
discrimination, data privacy, community well-being, and 
workplace safety. All employees received human rights 
training, and no violations were observed.
Looking ahead to FY26, we plan to expand HRDD 
coverage to all portfolio assets, strengthen supplier 
due diligence, and integrate human rights metrics 
into our ESG risk assessment framework. We will also 
enhance capacity-building initiatives for employees and 
contractors to embed a culture of respect, inclusion, and 
accountability across our operations and value chain.
Environmental and Social Due 
Diligence
Mindspace REIT has instituted a robust Environmental 
and Social Due Diligence (ESDD) framework as part of 
its asset acquisition and management strategy, ensuring 
alignment with international sustainability standards. 
The ESDD process involves detailed evaluation of 
environmental and social risks associated with each 
potential project, including verification of statutory E&S 
documents, compliance with The World Bank ESDD 
checklist, and timely resolution of any identified gaps. 
Where required, legal documents are renewed, ownership 
disputes resolved, and title clearances obtained from 
relevant authorities.
All projects are encouraged to obtain certifications such 
as ISO 14001, ISO 45001, and LEED, while implementing 
measures for resource efficiency and pollution control. 
In cases of land contamination, site assessments and 
remediation plans are undertaken in compliance with 
environmental regulations, including the Hazardous 
Waste Management Rules. Structural integrity, fire safety, 
ergonomics, and worker health and safety remain core 
priorities.
Mindspace REIT also prepares Annual Monitoring Reports 
(AMRs) in IFC’s preferred format, tracking key E&S 
parameters, action plans, and compliance status.
In FY26, we aim to further strengthen ESDD through 
digital integration, supplier and contractor audits, 
climate risk screening, and enhanced monitoring of E&S 
performance across all operational and development 
assets to advance sustainable growth.

had entered into a power purchase agreement dated 
May 27, 2021 ( “PPA”) with KEIPL for supply of power

power from the other available sources at market rates. 
This resulted into additional power purchase cost of  
` 101 Mn to be incurred by KRC DISCOMs on account 
of material breach of the PPA by KEIPL. Therefore, the 
KRC DISCOMs have filed this petition (Case No. 162

(ii) Criminal matters
1.  Sharmin Habib ( “Complainant”) lodged a first 
information report ( “FIR”) on October 10, 2017 with 
the Madhapur Police Station alleging that certain staff 
members of the Raheja Group ( “Accused”) prevented 
the Complainant and a staff from entering the premises 
for conducting the business of a day care centre in the 
name of Kidz Paradise in in Building No. 2.B, Mindspace 
Madhapur (KRIT), and harassed them. The concerned 
investigating officer has filed final report dated November 
16, 2017 of the matter before the Metropolitan Magistrate, 
Kukatpally at Miyapur, Cyberabad (“Court”), stating inter 
alia that while there was a rental dispute between the 
Complainant and the Accused which was pending in the 
Court, the particular incident was in relation to a regular 
security aspect of access in the IT Park being allowed on 
showing identity card, whereas Complaint tried to enter 
without showing identity card. The investigating officer 
also reported that the Complainant did not comply with 
the notices under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure 
Code, and that no such incident had occurred as alleged 
by the Complainant. The investigating officer further 
recorded that the complaint was filed on completely 
flimsy grounds and filed the final report before the Court 
recommending closure of the case on basis of lack of 
evidence. The matter is pending.
(iii) Regulatory actions
1.  The Comptroller and Auditor General of India ( “CAG”) 
had issued a report on public sector undertakings for 
the year ended March 2016 ( “CAG Report”) where 
certain audit observations were made with respect to 
certain public sector undertakings including: (a) a low 
rate of return on investments made by APIIC (now, 
TGIIC) in KRIT ; (b) allocation of the development and 
construction of complexes for IT and ITES companies 
to K. Raheja Corporation Private Limited by the erstwhile 
Government of Andhra Pradesh ( “GoAP”) without 
adopting a due tender process; (c) transfer of certain 
portion of land to non-IT/ITES sister companies of the 
KRC group, namely, Trion Properties Limited – Inorbit 
Malls and Chalet Hotels– Westin Hotel at a discounted 
price, in violation of GoAP directions dated August 
11, 2003 and without prior consultation with APIIC, 
pursuant to the demerger of KRIT . KRIT responded to 
the observations under the CAG report by its letter dated 
September 21, 2017 submitting its issue-wise detailed 
explanations and explaining various factual inaccuracies 
in respect of the said observations under the CAG 
Report, denying the irregularities and deficiencies. No 
further correspondence has been received.
2.  KRIT had proposed a rights issue of shares in which 
Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation 
(“APIIC”) (now, TGIIC) abstained from subscribing to 
the rights shares. Consequently, upon closure of the 
rights issue subscription by the other shareholders of 
KRC group, the stake of APIIC in KRIT reduced from 
11%. Thereafter, upon demerger of certain undertakings 
of KRIT into Intime and Sundew, the APIIC’s stake 
reduced in each of these entities instead of what it 
was initially at 11%.  Such rights issue of shares was 
undertaken in compliance with applicable law and 
agreement between the parties, and after KRIT had 
waited over one year for APIIC to decide.
  Subsequently, APIIC / GoAP disputed such dilution of 
their stake in KRIT , Intime and Sundew, which led to 
an inquiry by Vigilance and Enforcement Department 
of GoAP against the Government Officials and 
correspondingly, KRIT . APIIC issued a letter dated July 
10, 2012 to KRIT , referring to a report of vigilance and 
enforcement department ( “VED Report”) in relation to 
the Mindspace Madhapur project. Subsequently, the 
equity stake of APIIC was restored to 11% in KRIT , Intime 
and Sundew together with compensating APIIC for any 
loss of corporate benefits in the intervening period. The 
VED Report alleged certain irregularities, which include 
alleging a financial loss to APIIC and GoAP pursuant 
to sale of the land to its sister concerns and sale of 
constructed area, at a nominal price, dilution of 11% 
equity stake of APIIC and loss of immovable asset base 
to APIIC due to the dilution of equity.
  KRIT denied such irregularities, violations or financial 
loss caused to APIIC /GoAP .  While denying the loss 
alleged by APIIC, KRIT , Intime and Sundew provided a 
joint undertaking dated February 14, 2014 to APIIC inter 
alia undertaking (i) to pay the amounts to APIIC in respect 
of APIIC’s claim of losses, due to any differences in 
values pertaining to the sale transactions in Mindspace 
Madhapur project; (ii) that payments shall be made by 
KRIT within 30 days of receipt of such written demand 
from APIIC; and (iii) that KRIT shall be bound by the 
decision of APIIC and comply with the same within the 
stipulated timelines.
  KRIT has further provided an undertaking dated October 
24, 2016 to APIIC, inter alia undertaking to pay losses 
incurred by Government of T elangana /APIIC as per the 
VED Report and to maintain the agreed shareholding of 
the Government of T elangana or APIIC in KRIT , Intime 
and Sundew post conversion of KRIT to public limited 
company and the Government of T elangana/ APIIC will 
not be required to infuse additional funds to maintain its 
equity stake in KRIT , Intime and Sundew.

addressed to the wrong persons and informed PMC of 
the non-receipt of relevant information and documents

that the impugned challans, demands and notice are 
illegal, null and void and ultra vires; and called upon 
PMC to withdraw the impugned challans and letter 
forthwith. Further, without prejudice to the contentions 
raised in the reply and without admitting any liability to 
pay the amount as per the impugned challans, MBPPL

i.e. December 30, 2015, no objection was received and 
it was deemed approved and accordingly, the proposed

1 Distributions to Unitholders will be based on the net distributable cash flows available for distribution. Our ability to make 
distributions to the Unitholders may be affected by several factors including:
• business and financial position of Asset SPVs, debt servicing requirements of Asset SPVs,
• construction and leasing of under construction area,
applicable laws and regulations, which may restrict the payment of dividends by the Asset SPVs or other distributions.
2 The REIT Regulations impose certain restrictions on our operations, including maintaining a specific threshold of investment 
in rent generating properties and conditions on availing debt financing. These conditions may restrict our ability to raise 
additional funds as well as limit our ability to make investments.
3 Real estate markets are cyclical in nature, and a recession, slowdown or downturn in the real estate market as well as in 
specific sectors, such as technology, where our tenants are concentrated, including markets such as USA and Europe 
and adoption of hybrid work models, slowdown in hiring and job losses due to adoption of artificial intelligence, potentially 
leading to slowdown in office leasing activity, increase in property taxes, changes in development regulations and zoning 
laws, availability of financing, rising interest rates, increasing competition, adverse changes in the financial condition of our 
tenants, increased operating costs, disruptions in amenities and public infrastructure and possible outbreaks of pandemic, 
among others, may lead to a decline in demand for our Portfolio, which may adversely affect our business, results of 
operations and financial condition.
4 A significant portion of our revenues are derived from a limited number of tenants. Any conditions that impact these tenants 
could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are required by the terms of the lease 
deeds, grant documents or sale deeds with certain statutory authorities to lease a proportion of our Portfolio to tenants 
from the IT and IT eS sectors. Some of the assets are large and contribute significantly to our revenue from operations 
resulting in asset concentration.
Assets are primarily located in four key office markets and select micro markets within these office markets resulting in 
market and micro market concentration.
5 Our title to the land where the Portfolio is located may be subject to legal uncertainties and defects, which may interfere with 
our ownership of the assets and result in us incurring costs to remedy and cure such defects. Any failure or inability to cure 
such defects may adversely affect the Portfolio including the rentals, which may also impact returns for the Unitholders.
6 Existing lease/license agreements are subject to risks including (i) non-renewal upon expiration, (ii) delay or failure in 
making rental payments by the lessees/licensees, (iii) delay in receipt of / inability to obtain necessary approvals from 
regulatory bodies for letting out and commencing operations by the lessee/licensee, some of which may expire in the 
ordinary course of business and are subject to periodic renewals, (iv) premature termination, (v) failure to re-lease or re-
license the vacant space and our dependence on rental income may adversely affect our profitability, our ability to meet 
financial obligations, to make distributions to our Unitholders.
7 We may be unable to renew leases or license arrangements, lease or license vacant area or re-lease or re-license area on 
favourable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.
8 Due to a variety of factors, including competitive pricing pressure in our markets, changing market dynamics including 
demand supply, a general economic downturn and the desirability of our properties compared to other properties in our 
markets, we may be unable to realise our estimated market rents across the properties in our Portfolio at the time of future 
leasing.
9 Valuation is an estimate and not a guarantee, and it is dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions as to income, 
expense and market conditions. Further, the valuation methodologies used to value our Portfolio involve subjective 
judgments and projections, which may not be accurate. Valuation methodologies will also involve assumptions and 
opinions about future events, which may turn out to be incorrect. Further, valuations do not necessarily represent the price 
at which a real estate asset would sell, since market prices of assets can only be determined by negotiation between a 
willing buyer and seller. As such, the value of an asset forming part of our Portfolio may not reflect the price at which such 
asset could be sold in the market, and the difference between value and the ultimate sale price could be material.

10 The resurgence of COVID-19 or any other future pandemic may cause a material decline in general business activity 
and demand for real estate transactions, and if that persists, it would adversely affect our ability to execute our growth 
strategies, including identifying and completing acquisitions and expanding into new markets.
Factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic, or a future pandemic, that could have an adverse impact on our financial 
condition, results of operations and cash flows, primarily include:
- a complete or partial closure of, or other operational issues at, one or more of our properties;
- tenants’ inability to pay rent on their leases, in part or full or our inability to re-lease space that is or becomes vacant;
- slowdown in getting lease commitments for new spaces;
- any impairment in value of our properties;
- an increase in operational costs; and
- the extent of construction delays on our under-construction properties due to work-stoppage orders, disruptions in 
the supply of materials, shortage of labour, delays in inspections, or other factors.
11 We have certain contingent liabilities, which if they materialise, may adversely affect our results of operations, financial 
condition and cash flows. For details, see “Note 40 to Notes to accounts of Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
for the half year ended September 30, 2025”.
12 There are outstanding litigations, title irregularities and regulatory actions involving the Asset SPVs and the Manager, which 
may adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. For details, see “Brief details of material litigations 
and regulatory actions as at the half year ended September 30, 2025” in this report.
13 Our business and results of operations are subject to compliances with various laws, and any non-compliances may 
adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our business is governed by various laws and regulations, 
including but not limited to SEBI (Real Estate Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014, Transfer of Property Act, 1882, Special 
Economic Zones Act, 2005 and Special Economic Zone Rules, 2006, Maharashtra Industrial Development Act, 1961, 
Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority Act, 1974, Maharashtra Information T echnology and Information 
T echnology Enabled Services Policy, 2015, rent control legislations of various states, municipal laws of various states and 
environment related regulations. Our business could be adversely affected by any change in laws, municipal plans or 
stricter interpretation of existing laws, or promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations applicable to us.
The regulatory and policy environment in which we operate is constantly evolving and subject to change and such changes 
in the rules and regulations applicable to us and/or our Asset SPVs, may adversely affect our business, future results of 
operations, prospects and functioning, to the extent that we are unable to suitably respond to and comply with any such 
changes in applicable laws and policies.
For instance, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has amended the Companies (Corporate Social Responsibility 
Policy) Rules, 2014 and has introduced the Companies (Corporate Social Responsibility Policy) Amendment Rules, 2021 
(“CSR Rules”). The CSR Rules provides, among others, specific treatment of unspent CSR amount based on whether 
it pertains to an ongoing project. Any failure on the part of our Asset SPVs to make the necessary transfer towards CSR 
requirements and ensure compliance under the CSR Rules may result in penal actions being initiated against the relevant 
Asset SPV by the concerned regulatory authority.
14 The Ministry of Environment and Forests (“MOEF”) vide Office Memorandum dated May 01, 2018 (“CER OM”) had issued 
guidelines for recommending expenses towards ‘Corporate Environment Responsibility’ ( “CER”) with a view to bring 
transparency and uniformity in imposition of expenses towards CER. Accordingly, conditions relating to CER were being 
imposed in the environment clearances relating to projects. Thereafter, CER OM was superseded by OM dated September 
30, 2020 (“CER OM 2”) which directed that Expert Appraisal Committee (“EAC”) or State Level Expert Appraisal Committee 
(“SEAC”) shall deliberate on the commitments made by project proponent and prescribe specific condition(s) in physical 
terms while recommending the proposal, for grant of prior environment clearance instead of allocation of funds under CER. 
The CER OM 2 further directed that all the activities proposed by the project proponent or prescribed by the EAC/SEAC, as 
the case may be, shall be part of the Environment Management Plan (“EMP”). Consequently, CER OM is not valid and only 
(1) the commitments which are deliberated by EAC/SLEAC, and (2) specific conditions prescribed in physical terms while 
recommending the proposal need to be complied with. In view of the aforesaid, the respective Asset SPV’s have made or 
will make (if required) the aforesaid representations to MOEF authorities including during the MOEF hearings for grant of 
amended EC’s (if required) in respect of the respective REIT Assets, or table the same in the periodic reports being filed 
with the authorities. If any alternate view is taken by the MOEF authorities and despite the CER OM 2, the MOEF authorities 
mandate compliance of CER in accordance with CER OM, then Asset SPVs will have to incur additional expenses towards 
compliance of CER in accordance with CER OM and any delay or failure on the part of the respective Asset SPVs to make 
the necessary spending towards CER may result in penal actions being initiated against the relevant Asset SPV by the 
concerned regulatory authority.

15 Any non-compliance with and/or changes in, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could adversely 
affect the development of our properties and our financial condition. We are subject to environmental, health and safety 
regulations in the ordinary course of our business. If we face any environmental issue during the development of a property 
or if the government introduces more stringent regulations, we may incur delays in our estimated timelines and may need 
to incur additional costs.
16 Any delay, failure or inability on part of Asset SPVs to obtain, maintain or renew all regulatory approvals that are required 
for their respective businesses, may adversely impact our development and business.
17 For our assets located on land leased from MIDC and MMRDA, the relevant Asset SPVs are required to comply with the 
terms and conditions provided in the respective lease agreements with such government bodies. Any non-compliance 
by the Asset SPVs of the respective lease agreements with such government bodies or by the tenants of the terms of the 
lease deed executed with them, may result in the action by the regulatory authorities, including revocation/termination of 
lease, demolition of the construction, payment of fines, or inability to produce lease agreements as evidence of the fact in 
any court of law. In the event that our leases are revoked, not renewed or terminated prematurely, it could have an adverse 
impact on the Asset SPVs and in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
18 Inability to access infrastructure, certain logistical challenges in new markets and our relative inexperience with newer 
markets, may prevent us from expanding our presence in new markets in India which may adversely affect our business, 
results of operations and cash flows.
19 We have entered and may enter into several related party transactions, which could involve conflicts of interest. The 
Manager may face conflicts of interests in choosing our service providers, and certain service providers may provide 
services to the Manager, the Sponsor Group on more favourable terms than those applicable to us.
20 Some of our assets are located on land notified as SEZs and the Asset SPVs are required to comply with the SEZ Act and 
the rules made thereunder.
While no income tax benefits are available to SEZ developers which have been notified after March 31, 2017, income tax 
benefits are available for their tenants/units on the income earned by them on account of the exports from the SEZs, if they 
have commenced operations on or before March 31, 2021.
Further, some of our Asset SPVs have made applications for de-notifying certain land parcels notified as SEZs and hence 
they will be eligible to avail lower fiscal incentives than what were previously available to them, which may adversely affect 
our business, results of operations and financial condition.
21 Due to various regulatory and other restrictions, we may not be able to successfully meet financing requirements for 
completion of construction of Under Construction Area, construction of Future Development Area and for refurbishments, 
renovation and improvements beyond our current estimates.
Our inability to raise adequate finances may adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.
22 Liquidity in the credit market may become constrained due to market disruptions, including due to conflicts among other 
countries, along with higher nominal interest rates due to inflationary pressures may make it costly to obtain new lines 
of credit or refinance existing debt. As a result, we may not be able to refinance our existing indebtedness or to obtain 
additional financing on attractive terms. Further, adverse economic conditions could negatively affect commercial real 
estate fundamentals and result in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values in our Portfolio and in the 
collateral securing any loan investments we may make.
23 Any adverse tax changes or withdrawal of tax benefits may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.
Any maintenance or refurbishment may result in disruption of operations and it may not be possible to collect the full or any 
rental income on area affected by such renovations and refurbishment of our assets.
24 The restrictive covenants under the financing agreements, entered or to be entered into with various lenders or investors, 
from time to time, include or could include, among others, (a) obtaining prior consent of the lenders (i) for change in the 
capital structure, (ii) for amendment of constitutional documents, (iii) for declaration of dividends/ distribution of profits 
in case of defaults, (iv) for incurring further indebtedness against the security provided, (v) for making any acquisition/
disposal of assets and (vi) for providing surety or guarantee to any third party, and (b) certain reporting requirements with 
timelines which, if not complied with, may lead to defaults consequences. These or other limitations may adversely affect 
our flexibility and our ability to make distributions to our Unitholders.

25 We are not fully insured against some business risks and the occurrence of accidents that cause losses in excess of limits 
specified under our policies, or losses arising from events not covered by our insurance policies, such as damage caused 
to our property and equipment due to war, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
While we believe that we have industry standard insurance for our Portfolio, if a fire or natural disaster substantially damages 
or destroys some or all of our assets in the Portfolio, the proceeds of any insurance claim may be insufficient to cover any 
expenses faced by us, including rebuilding costs.
26 Under the REIT Regulations, a REIT is required to hold assets acquired by it for a period of three years from the date of 
purchase and in case of under-construction properties or under-construction portions of existing properties acquired by it, 
three years from the date of their completion. Additionally, any sale of property or shares or interest in the Asset SPVs by the 
holding company or REIT , as the case may be, exceeding 10% of the value of the REIT assets will require prior approval of 
the Unitholders. These factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
27 Any disagreements with our collaborators or joint venture partners or any delay or failure to satisfy the terms and conditions 
set-out in the binding agreements with such collaborators or the joint-venture partners, may adversely impact our business 
and operations.
28 We do not own the trademarks or logos for “Mindspace”, “Mindspace Business Parks”, “K Raheja Corp”, “Commerzone” 
“CAMPLUS” and “The Square” that are associated with our Portfolio. Further, we do not own the trademark or logo for 
“Mindspace Business Parks REIT” and “Mindspace REIT”. These trademarks and logos are licensed to our Asset SPVs, the 
Manager and us, as applicable, by the Sponsors or Sponsor Group entities who are either the registered owners of these 
trademarks and logos or have made applications for registered ownership some of which are pending. We may not be 
able to prevent infringement of the trademark, and a passing off action may not provide sufficient protection. Accordingly, 
we may be required to litigate to protect our trademark and logo, which could be time consuming and expensive and may 
adversely affect our business and results of operations.
29 Our Asset SPVs may, in the future be exposed to a variety of risks associated with development of an Integrated IT 
T ownship, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
30 Land is subject to compulsory acquisition by the government and compensation in lieu of such acquisition may be 
inadequate. Additionally, we may be subject to conditions of use or transfer of land wherever such land is subject to orders 
under the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976.
31 On-going conflicts such as Russia-Ukraine conflict, Israel-Iran conflict and Israel-Hamas conflict, supply chain disruptions, 
inflation / increase in commodity prices, imposition of reciprocal tariffs by the United States of America globally and 
retaliatory tariffs by other nations, could result in a wide range of economic consequences, financial instability and could 
potentially impact projects under development and our business, results of operations and financial condition.
32 Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the Indian Rupee and other currencies will affect the foreign currency equivalent 
of the Indian Rupee price of the Units. Such fluctuations will also affect the amount that holders of the Units will receive in 
foreign currency upon conversion of cash distributions or other distributions paid in Indian Rupees by us on the Units, and 
any proceeds paid in Indian Rupees from any sale of the Units in the secondary trading market. This may have an adverse 
effect on the price of our Units, independent of our operating results. For instance, the exchange rate between the Indian 
Rupee and the U.S. dollar has fluctuated substantially in recent years and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the 
future.
33 Our portfolio is subject to risks inherent in ownership interests in properties as some of the properties in which we have an 
interest are part of a larger development which comprises certain areas which are held by or are adjacent to or incorporate 
common or other areas which are shared with owners of neighbouring properties. Any development or asset enhancement 
works that we propose for such properties may require the consent and cooperation of these owners, which may not be 
forthcoming in a timely manner or at all, or on terms acceptable to us. Our inability to obtain the requisite consent may 
affect our ability to deal with our interests in some of our properties in a manner which achieves our objectives and in turn 
could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.

34 We are exposed to a variety of risks associated with safety, security and crisis management.
Serious incidents or a combination of events, including but not limited to, exceptional events such as extreme weather, 
civil or political unrest, violence and terrorism, serious and organised crime, fraud, employee dishonesty, cybercrime, 
pandemics, fire and day-to-day accidents, incidents, health crises of guests and petty crime which impact the tenant, 
consumers, hotel guest or employee experience, could cause loss of life, sickness or injury and result in compensation 
claims, fines from regulatory bodies, litigation and impact our reputation and such events which are not in our control could 
result in a crisis which, if managed poorly, could further expose us and our Asset SPVs to significant reputational damage. 
Any accidents or any criminal activity at our properties may result in personal injury or loss of life, substantial damage to or 
destruction of property and equipment resulting in the suspension of operations.
While we maintain insurance on property and equipment in amounts believed to be adequate and consistent with industry 
practice, we may not be able to cover all losses we may incur in our business operations.
35 We may not be able to successfully complete future acquisitions or efficiently manage the assets we may acquire in the 
future. Further, any of our acquisitions in the future may be subject to acquisition related risks.
36 Some or all of our under construction area and future development area may not be completed by their expected completion 
dates or at all. Such delays could affect its estimated construction cost and timelines resulting in cost overruns, which in 
turn could adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial conditions.
37 We depend on the Manager and its personnel for our success, along with for managing our business, assets and results 
of operations. We may not find a suitable replacement for the Manager if the Investment Management Agreement is 
terminated or if any key / senior management personnel of the Manager ceases to be employed by the Manager or 
otherwise become unavailable to us.
38 We rely on third party operators to successfully operate and manage certain assets. Any deficiency or interruption in their 
services may adversely affect our business.

INTRODUCTION
1.  We have reviewed the accompanying unaudited 
Condensed Standalone Financial Statements of 
Mindspace Business Parks REIT  (the “REIT”),  
(“the Condensed Standalone Financial Statements”) 
which comprise of the following:
 •  the unaudited Condensed Standalone Balance 
Sheet as at September 30, 2025;
 •  the unaudited Condensed Standalone Statement 
of Profit and Loss (including other comprehensive 
income) for the quarter and half year ended  
September 30, 2025;
 •  the unaudited Condensed Standalone Statement 
of Cash flow for the quarter and half year ended 
September 30, 2025;
 •  the unaudited Condensed Standalone Statement 
of Changes in Unitholders’ Equity for the half year 
ended September 30, 2025;
 •  the unaudited Statement of Net Assets at Fair Value 
as at September 30, 2025;
 •  the unaudited Statement of T otal Returns at Fair 
Value for the half year ended September 30, 2025;
 •  
the unaudited Statement of Net Distributable 
Cash Flow for the quarter and half year ended 
September 30, 2025; and
 • select explanatory notes.
  These Condensed Standalone Financial Statements 
are being submitted by the Manager pursuant to the 
requirements of Securities and Exchange Board of India 
(Real Estate Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014 as 
amended (the “REIT Regulations”), and pursuant to 
requirement of Regulations 52 and 54 of the SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015, as amended (“Listing Regulations”).
2. 
 The Condensed Standalone Financial Statements, which 
is the responsibility of Manager and approved by the 
Manager’s Board of Directors, have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the REIT Regulations, 
Listing Regulations, the recognition and measurement 
principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 
“Interim Financial Reporting” (“Ind AS 34”), prescribed 
under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with 
relevant rules issued thereunder, and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility 
is to express a conclusion on the Condensed Standalone 
Financial Statements based on our review.
SCOPE OF REVIEW
3.  We conducted our review of the Condensed Standalone 
Financial Statements in accordance with the Standard 
on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410 ‘Review of Interim 
Financial Information Performed by the Independent 
Auditor of the Entity’, issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (ICAI). A review of interim financial 
information consists of making inquiries, primarily 
of the Manager’s personnel responsible for financial 
and accounting matters, and applying analytical and 
other review procedures. A review is substantially less 
in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with 
Standards on Auditing issued by ICAI and consequently 
does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would 
become aware of all significant matters that might be 
identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an 
audit opinion.
CONCLUSION
4.  Based on our review conducted and procedures 
performed as stated in paragraph 3 above, nothing has 
come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 
accompanying Statement, has not been prepared in 
accordance with the REIT Regulations which prevails 
over certain Ind AS requirements, as explained in 
the Emphasis of Matter paragraph 5 below, Listing 
Regulations and also in accordance with the recognition 
and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid 
Indian Accounting Standard and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, or has not 
disclosed the information required to be disclosed 
in terms of REIT Regulations, including the manner in 
which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material 
misstatement.
EMPHASIS OF MATTER
5.  We draw attention to Note 15(a)(i) of the Condensed 
Standalone Financial Statements, which describes the 
presentation of “Unit Capital” as “Equity” to comply with 
REIT Regulations. Our conclusion is not modified in 
respect of this matter.

 Notes
 1) Measurement of fair values:
   The fair values of Investments in SPV are computed basis the fair value of Investment property, Property, plant 
and equipment, Investment property under construction and Capital work-in-progress which are solely based on 
an independent valuation performed by an external property valuer (“”independent valuer””), having appropriately 
recognised professional qualification and recent experience in the location and category of the properties being valued.
  Valuation Technique
   The fair value measurement for all of the Investment property, Property, plant and equipment, Investment property under 
construction and Capital work-in-progress including Pocharam, which has been classified as held for sale (excluding 
Pocharam building) has been categorised as a Level 3 fair value based on the inputs to the valuation technique 
used. The valuer has followed a Discounted Cash Flow method, except for valuation of land for future development 
where the valuer has adopted Comparable Sales Method (under the Market Approach). The Discounted Cash Flow 
valuation model considers the present value of net cash flows to be generated from the respective properties, taking 
into account the expected rental growth rate, vacancy period, occupancy rate, and lease incentive costs. The expected 
net cash flows are discounted using the risk adjusted discount rates. Among other factors, the discount rate estimation 
considers the quality of a building and its location (prime vs secondary), tenant credit quality, lease terms and investor 
return expectations from such properties.The existing buildings in Pocharam are unoccupied. Considering the absence 
of leasing demand in the near term, and therefore no expected income stream and also since the asset is held for sale, 
the Valuer has opted for the Cost Approach. Under this method, building and plant & machinery components have 
been valued using the Depreciated Replacement Cost Method. The same has been categorised as a Level 3 fair value 
based on the inputs from the valuation technique used.

regulations. (refer note 15 on presentation of “Unit 
Capital” as “Equity” instead of compound instruments 
under Ind AS 32 – Financial Instruments: Presentation). 
The accounting policies adopted and methods of 
computation followed are consistent with those of the 
previous financial year.
  Accounting policies have been consistently applied 
except where a newly issued accounting standard is 
initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting 
standard requires a change in the accounting policy 
hitherto in use.
  These Condensed Standalone Financial Statements 
were authorised for issue in accordance with the 
resolution passed by the Board of Directors of the 
Manager on November 05, 2025.
 Statement of compliance to Ind-AS
  These Condensed Standalone Financial Statements for

been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting 
Standard (Ind AS) 34 “Interim Financial Reporting”,as 
prescribed in Rule 2(1)(a) of the Companies (Indian

3 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 a) Functional and Presentation Currency
   The Condensed Standalone Financial Statements 
are presented in Indian Rupees, which is also 
Mindspace REIT functional currency in which 
Mindspace REIT operates. All financial information 
presented in Indian Rupees has been rounded off 
to the nearest Mn except otherwise stated.
 b) Basis of measurement
   These Condensed Standalone Financial Statements 
are prepared on the historical cost basis, except 
for certain financial assets and liabilities (refer 
accounting policy regarding financial instrument) 
measured at fair values.
 c) Use of judgments and estimates
   The preparation of the Condensed Standalone 
Financial Statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles in India (Ind AS) 
requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual 
results could differ from those estimates.
   Estimates and underlying assumptions are 
reviewed on a periodic basis. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimates are revised and in any future 
periods affected.
   Information about critical judgements in applying 
accounting policies that have the most material 
effect on the amounts recognised in the Condensed 
Standalone Financial Statements is included in the 
following notes:
  (i)  Presentation of “Unit Capital” as “Equity” in 
accordance with the SEBI REIT Regulations 
instead of compound instrument (Note no 15)
  (ii)  Impairment and Fair valuation of Investments 
in SPVs and impairment of loans to SPVs. 
(Note 4 and 5)
  (iii)  Recognition and measurement of provisions 
for contingencies and disclosure of contingent 
liabilities (Note 32 (a))
 d) Current versus non-current classification
   Mindspace REIT presents assets and liabilities in 
the Balance Sheet based on current/ non-current 
classification:
  An asset is treated as current when it is:
   - Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or 
consumed in normal operating cycle;
  - Held primarily for the purpose of trading;
   - Expected to be realised within twelve months after 
the reporting date; or
   - Cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted 
from being exchanged or used to settle a liability 
for at least twelve months after the reporting date.
  All other assets are classified as non-current.
  A liability is current when:
   - It is expected to be settled in normal operating 
cycle;
    - It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
   - It is due to be settled within twelve months after 
the reporting date; or

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTD.)
RN:IN/REIT/19-20/003 (All amounts are in ` Mn unless otherwise stated)
   -There is no right at end of the reporting period to 
defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period.
  All other liabilities are classified as non-current
   Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as 
non-current assets and liabilities.
   The operating cycle is the time between the 
acquisition of assets for processing and their 
realisation in cash and cash equivalents. 
Mindspace REIT has identified twelve months as 
its operating cycle.
 e) Measurement of fair values
   Fair value is the price that would be received to 
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an 
orderly transaction between market participants 
at the measurement date, regardless of whether 
that price is directly observable or estimated using 
another valuation technique. In estimating the fair 
value of an asset or a liability, the Trust takes into 
account the characteristics of the asset or liability 
and how market participants would take those 
characteristics into account when pricing the asset 
or liability at the measurement date.
   Mindspace REIT accounting policies and 
disclosures require the measurement of fair values, 
for both financial and non-financial assets and 
liabilities. Mindspace REIT has an established 
control framework with respect to the measurement 
of fair values.
   Mindspace REIT regularly reviews significant 
unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. 
If third party information is used to measure 
fair values then the finance team assesses the 
evidence obtained from the third parties to support 
the conclusion that such valuations meet the 
requirements of Ind AS, including the level in the 
fair value hierarchy in which such valuations should 
be classified.
   When measuring the fair value of an asset or a 
liability, Mindspace REIT uses observable market 
data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised 
into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based 
on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as 
follows:
  •  Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities that 
entity can access on measurement date.
  •  Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices 
included in Level 1 that are observable for the 
asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
  •  Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that 
are not based on observable market data 
(unobservable inputs).
   If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an 
asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair 
value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is 
categorised in its entirety in the same level of the 
fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is 
significant to the entire measurement.
 3.1 Foreign currency transactions
   Transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
are initially recorded at the functional currency spot 
rate at the date of the transactions first qualifies for 
recognition.
   Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies, are translated at the functional 
currency spot rate at the reporting date. Non-
monetary foreign currency items that are measured 
in terms of historical cost are translated using 
functional currency spot rates at the dates of 
initial transactions. Exchange differences arising 
on settlement or translation of monetary items are 
recognised in statement of profit or loss.
 3.2 Embedded derivatives
   Derivatives embedded in a host contract that is 
an asset within the scope of Ind AS 109 are not 
separated. Financial assets with embedded 
derivatives are considered in their entirety 
when determining whether their cash flows 
are solely payment of principal and interest.  
Embedded derivatives closely related to the 
host contracts are not separated. Derivatives 
embedded in all other host contract are separated 
only if the economic characteristics and risks of the 
embedded derivative are not closely related to the 
economic characteristics and risks of the host and 
are measured at fair value through profit or loss. “
 3.3 Tax expense
   Income tax expense comprises current tax and 
deferred tax charge or credit. It is recognised in 
the Condensed Standalone Statement of Profit 
and Loss except to the extent that it relates to 
an item recognised directly in equity or in other 
comprehensive income in which case, the current 
184
Half-yearly Report 2025-26
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTD.)
RN:IN/REIT/19-20/003 (All amounts are in ` Mn unless otherwise stated)
and deferred tax are also recognised in equity and 
other comprehensive income respectively.
  a) Current tax
    Current tax comprises the expected tax 
payable or receivable on the taxable income 
for the period and any adjustment to the tax 
payable or receivable in respect of previous 
years. The amount of current tax reflects the 
best estimate of the tax amount expected to 
be paid after considering the uncertainty, if 
any, related to income taxes. It is measured 
using tax rates (and tax laws) enacted or 
substantively enacted by end of reporting 
period. Current tax assets and liabilities are 
offset only if there is a legally enforceable 
right to set off the recognised amounts, and it 
is intended to realise the asset and settle the 
liability on a net basis or simultaneously.
    Section 115UA of the Income T ax Act, 1961 
governs special provisions relating to taxation 
of Business Trusts. The said section read with 
10(23FC) of the Act provides for exemption of 
dividend income and interest income received 
from Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) in 
the hands of Business Trusts. Applying the 
provisions of the said sections, the dividend 
income and interest income received or 
receivable by MREIT from its SPVs are exempt 
from tax.
  b) Deferred tax
    Deferred tax asset/ liability is recognised on 
temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
Condensed Standalone Financial Statements 
and the corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are measured that are 
expected to apply to the period when the 
asset is realised or the liability is settled, using 
the tax rates and tax laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the end 
of the reporting period.
    The measurement of deferred tax liabilities 
and assets reflects the tax consequences 
that would follow from the manner in which 
Mindspace REIT expects, at the end of the 
reporting period, to recover or settle the 
carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
    Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised 
for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred 
tax assets are generally recognised for all 
deductible temporary differences to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profits will be 
available against which those deductible 
temporary differences can be utilized. Such 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are not 
recognized if the temporary difference arises 
from the initial recognition (other than in a 
business combination) of assets and liabilities 
in a transaction that affects neither the taxable 
profit nor the accounting profit.
    The carrying amount of deferred tax assets 
are reviewed at the end of each reporting 
period and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits 
will be available to allow all or part of the asset 
to be recovered.
    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset 
if there is a legally enforceable right to offset 
current tax assets and liabilities, and they 
relate to income taxes levied by the same tax 
authority on the same taxable entity, or on 
different tax entities, but they intend to settle 
current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis 
or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized 
simultaneously.
 3.4 Provisions and contingent liabilities
   Provisions are recognised when Mindspace REIT 
has a present legal or constructive obligation 
as a result of a past event, it is probable that the 
Trust will be required to settle the obligation, and a 
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. The amount recognised as a provision 
is the best estimate of the consideration net of 
recoveries if any, required to settle the present 
obligation at the end of the reporting period, 
taking into account the risks and uncertainties 
surrounding the obligation. Provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected future 
cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding 
of the discount is recognised as finance cost.
   Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is 
a possible obligation or a present obligation that 
may, but will probably not, require an outflow of 
resources. When there is a possible obligation of a 
185
MINDSPACE BUSINESS PARKS REIT
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTD.)
RN:IN/REIT/19-20/003 (All amounts are in ` Mn unless otherwise stated)
present obligation in respect of which the likelihood 
of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or 
disclosure is made.
   Provisions and Contingent Liabilities are reviewed 
at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the 
current best estimates.
 3.5 Investment in SPVs
   The Trust has elected to recognise its investments 
in SPVs at cost in accordance with the option 
available in Ind AS 27, ‘Separate Financial 
Statements’. The details of such investments are 
given in Note 4.
   Assets representing investments in SPVs are 
reviewed for impairment, whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that 
carrying amount may not be recoverable. Such 
circumstances include, though are not limited 
to, significant or sustained decline in revenues 
or earnings and material adverse changes in the 
economic environment.
 3.6 Financial instruments
  1 Initial recognition and measurement
    Financial assets and/or financial liabilities are 
recognised when Mindspace REIT becomes 
party to a contract embodying the related 
financial instruments. All financial assets, 
financial liabilities are initially measured at fair 
value. Transaction costs that are attributable to 
the acquisition or issue of financial assets and 
financial liabilities (other than financial assets 
and financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit or loss) are added to or deducted from 
as the case may be, the fair value of such 
assets or liabilities, on initial recognition. 
Transaction costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition of financial assets or financial 
liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 
(FVTPL) are recognised immediately in the 
Condensed Standalone Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
  2 Financial assets:
   a) Classification of financial assets:
    (i)  Mindspace REIT classifies its 
financial assets in the following 
measurement categories:
      -those to be measured 
subsequently at fair value (either 
through other comprehensive 
income, or through the Statement 
of Profit and Loss), and
      -those measured at amortised cost.
    (ii)  The classification is done 
depending upon Mindspace REIT 
business model for managing the 
financial assets and the contractual 
terms of the cash flows.
    (iii)  For investments in debt instruments, 
this will depend on the business 
model in which the investment is 
held.
    (iv)  Mindspace REIT reclassifies debt 
investments when and only when 
its business model for managing 
those assets changes.
   b) Subsequent Measurement
    (i) Investment in Debt instruments:
      Subsequent measurement of debt 
instruments depends on Mindspace 
REIT business model for managing 
the asset and the cash flow 
characteristics of the asset. There 
are three measurement categories 
into which the Trust classifies its 
debt instruments:
      Financial assets at amortised 
cost
      Financial assets are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost if these 
financial assets are held within a 
business whose objective is to 
hold these assets in order to collect 
contractual cash flows and the 
contractual terms of the financial 
asset give rise on specified dates to 
cash flows that are solely payments 
of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
      Financial assets at fair value 
through other comprehensive 
income (FVTOCI)
      Financial assets are subsequently 
measured at fair value through 
other comprehensive income if 
these financial assets are held 
within a business whose objective

is achieved by both collecting 
contractual cash flows that 
give rise on specified dates to

outstanding and by selling financial 
assets.

      Financial assets are subsequently 
measured at fair value through 
the Statement of Profit and Loss 
unless it is measured at amortised 
cost or fair value through other 
comprehensive income on initial 
recognition. The transaction 
costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition of financial assets and 
liabilities at fair value through profit 
or loss are immediately recognised 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
   c) Impairment of financial assets:
     The Mindspace REIT applies the 
expected credit loss model for 
recognising impairment loss on financial 
assets measured at amortised cost, 
other contractual rights to receive cash 
or other financial asset. This expected 
credit loss allowance is computed 
based on a provision matrix which 
takes into account historical credit loss 
experience and adjusted for forward-
looking information.
   d) Derecognition of financial assets:
     
A financial asset is primarily derecognised 
when:
    (i)  the right to receive cash flows from 
the asset has expired, or
    (ii)  Mindspace REIT has transferred its 
rights to receive cash flows from 
the asset; and
      Mindspace REIT has transferred 
substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset, or
      Mindspace REIT has neither 
transferred nor retained 
substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset.
      On derecognition of a financial 
asset in its entirety (other than 
investments in equity instruments at 
FVTOCI), the differences between 
the carrying amounts measured 
at the date of derecognition and 
the consideration received is 
recognised in Statement of Profit 
and Loss. Any interest in transferred 
financial assets that is created or 
retained by Mindspace REIT is 
recognised as a separate asset or 
liability.
 3.7 Financial liabilities and equity instruments
  (a) Classification as debt or equity
    Financial liabilities and equity instruments 
issued by Mindspace REIT are classified 
according to the substance of the contractual 
arrangements entered into and the definitions 
of a financial liability and an equity instrument.
   Financial Liabilities
    Recognition, measurement and 
classification
    Financial liabilities are classified as either 
held at a) fair value through the Statement 
of Profit and Loss, or b) at amortised cost. 
Management determines the classiﬁcation 
of its financial liabilities at the time of initial 
recognition or, where applicable, at the time 
of reclassification.
    Mindspace REIT financial liabilities 
include trade and other payables, loans 
and borrowings and derivative financial 
instruments. Subsequent measurement 
of financial liabilities depends on their 
classification as fair value through the 
Statement of Profit and Loss or at amortised 
cost. All changes in fair value of financial 
liabilities classified as FVTPL are recognised 
in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Amortised 
cost category is applicable to loans and 
borrowings, trade and other payables. After 
initial recognition the financial liabilities 
are measured at amortised cost using the 
Effective Interest Rate method.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTD.)
RN:IN/REIT/19-20/003 (All amounts are in ` Mn unless otherwise stated)
   Derecognition
    A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged or 
cancelled or expires. Gains and losses are 
recognised in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss when the liabilities are derecognised.
   Offsetting of financial instruments
    Financial assets and financial liabilities are 
offset and presented on net basis in the 
Balance Sheet when there is a currently 
enforceable legal right to offset the recognised 
amounts and there is an intention either to 
settle on a net basis or to realise the assets 
and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
 3.8 Financial guarantee contracts
   A financial guarantee contract is a contract that 
requires the issuer to make specified payments to 
reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a 
specified debtor fails to make payments when due 
in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. 
Financial guarantee contract are measured initially 
at the fair value and in accordance with Ind AS 
109 unless on a case to case basis Mindspace 
REIT elects to account for financial guarantee as 
Insurance Contracts. Subsequently, the liability 
is measured at the higher of the amount of 
loss allowance determined as per impairment 
requirements of Ind AS 109 and the amount 
recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative 
amount of income recognised in accordance with 
the principles of Ind AS 115.”
 3.9 Revenue Recognition
   Revenue is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable. This inter 
alia involves discounting of the consideration due 
to the present value if payment extends beyond 
normal credit terms.
   Revenue is recognised when recovery of the 
consideration is probable and the amount of 
revenue can be measured reliably.
   Recognition of dividend income, interest 
income
   Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss 
on the date on which Mindspace REIT’s right to 
receive payment is established.
   Interest income is recognised using the effective 
interest method. The ‘effective interest rate’ is the 
rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
receipts through the expected life of the financial 
instrument to the gross carrying amount of the 
financial asset.
   In calculating interest income, the effective interest 
rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of 
the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired). 
However, for financial assets that have become 
credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest income is calculated by applying the 
effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the 
financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-
impaired, then the calculation of interest income 
reverts to the gross basis.
 3.10 Borrowing costs
   Borrowing costs are interest and other costs 
(including exchange differences relating to foreign 
currency borrowings to the extent that they are 
regarded as an adjustment to interest costs) 
incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds. 
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in 
the period in which they are incurred.
   Interest expense is recognised using the effective 
interest method. The ‘effective interest rate’ is the 
rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
payments through the expected life of the financial 
instrument to the amortised cost of the financial 
liability. In calculating interest expense, the effective 
interest rate is applied to the amortised cost of the 
liability.
 3.11 Cash and cash equivalents
   Cash and cash equivalents comprises of cash at 
bank and on hand, demand deposits, investment 
in overnight mutual funds, other short term, highly 
liquid investments with original maturities of three 
months or less that are readily convertible to known 
amounts of cash and which are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value.
 3.12 Distribution to unit holders
   Mindspace REIT recognises a liability to make 
distributions to Unitholders when the distribution 
is authorised and a legal obligation has been 
created. As per the REIT Regulations, a distribution 
is authorised when it is approved by the Board of 
Directors of the Manager. A corresponding amount 
is recognised directly in equity.

RN:IN/REIT/19-20/003 (All amounts are in ` Mn unless otherwise stated)
 3.13 Statement of Cash flows
   Cash flow is reported using the indirect method, 
whereby net profit before tax is adjusted for the 
effects of transactions of a non-cash nature 
and any deferrals or accruals of past or future 
cash receipts or payments. The cash flows from 
operating, investing and financing activities of 
Mindspace REIT are segregated.
   For the purpose of the Statement of Cash Flow, 
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and 
short-term deposits, as defined above, net of 
outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered 
an integral part of the Mindspace REIT’s cash 
management.
 3.14 Subsequent events
   If the Trust receives information after the reporting 
period, but prior to the date of approved for 
issue, about conditions that existed at the end 
of the reporting period, it will assess whether the 
information affects the amounts that it recognises 
in its Financial Statements. The Trust will adjust the 
amounts recognised in its Financial Statements 
to reflect any adjusting events after the reporting 
period and update the disclosures that relate to 
those conditions in light of the new information. 
For non-adjusting events after the reporting period, 
the Trust will not change the amounts recognised 
in its Financial Statements, but will disclose the 
nature of the non-adjusting event and an estimate 
of its financial effect, or a statement that such an 
estimate cannot be made, if applicable.
 3.15 Earnings per unit
   The basic earnings per unit is computed by dividing 
the net profit/ (loss) attributable to the unit holders 
of the REIT by the weighted average number of 
units outstanding during the reporting period. 
The number of units used in computing diluted 
earnings/ (loss) per unit comprises the weighted 
average units considered for deriving basic 
earnings/ (loss) per unit and also the weighted 
average number of units which could have been 
issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential 
units.
 3.16 Earnings before finance costs and tax
   Mindspace REIT has elected to present earnings 
before finance cost and tax as a separate line 
item on the face of the Condensed Standalone 
Statement of Profit and Loss. Mindspace REIT 
measures earnings before finance cost and tax 
on the basis of profit/ (loss) from continuing 
operations. In its measurement, Mindspace REIT 
does not include finance costs and tax expense.
 3.17 Errors and estimates
   Mindspace Business Parks REIT revises its 
accounting policies if the change is required due 
to a change in Ind AS or if the change will provide 
more relevant and reliable information to the users 
of the Condensed Standalone financial statement. 
Changes in accounting policies are applied 
retrospectively.
   A change in an accounting estimate that results 
in changes in the carrying amounts of recognised 
assets or liabilities or to profit or loss is applied 
prospectively in the period(s) of change.
 3.18 Distribution Policy
   The Net Distributable Cash Flows of Mindspace 
REIT are based on the cash flows generated from 
Mindspace REIT’s assets and investments. In terms 
of the Distribution Policy of Mindspace REIT and the 
REIT Regulations, not less than 90% of the NDCF of 
each of the Asset SPVs is required to be distributed 
to Mindspace REIT , in proportion of Mindspace 
REIT’s shareholding in the Asset SPV , subject to 
applicable provisions of the Companies Act 2013. 
NDCF to be received by Mindspace REIT from the 
Asset SPVs may be in the form of dividends, interest 
income, principal loan repayment, proceeds of any 
capital reduction or buyback from the Asset SPVs 
or as specifically permitted under the Trust Deed or 
in such other form as may be permissible under the 
REIT Regulations. Such SPV Distributions shall be 
declared and made for every quarter of a Financial 
Year in terms of the Distribution Policy.

    Ind AS 21 - The Effects of Changes in 
Foreign Exchange Rates
    On May 07, 2025, the Ministry of Corporate 
Affairs issued amendment to Ind AS 21 to 
address situations where currency lacks 
exchangeability. The amendement specifies 
how an entity should assess whether a 
currency is exchangeable and how it should 
determine a spot exchange rate when 
exchangeability is lacking. The amendments 
also require disclosure of information that 
enables users of its financial statements 
to understand how the currency not being 
exchangeable into the other currency affects, 
or is expected to affect, the entity’s financial 
performance, financial position and cash 
flows. When applying the amendment, an 
entity is not required to restate comparative 
information. The amendment is not relevant 
or do not have an impact on the Condensed 
Standalone Financial Statements of the Entity.
    On August 13, 2025, the Ministry of Corporate 
Affairs has issued amendments to the 
following standards:
    Ind AS 1- Presentation of Financial 
Statements
    MCA issued amendments to paragraphs 69 
to 76 of Ind AS 1 to specify the requirements 
for classifying liabilities as current or non-
current. The amendments clarify:
   •  What is meant by a right to defer 
settlement
   •  That a right to defer must exist at the end 
of the reporting period
   •  That classification is unaffected by the 
likelihood that an entity will exercise its 
deferral right
   •  That only if an embedded derivative in 
a convertible liability is itself an equity 
instrument would the terms of a liability 
not impact its classification
     In addition, a requirement has been 
introduced to require disclosure when a 
liability arising from a loan agreement is 
classified as non-current and the entity’s 
right to defer settlement is contingent on 
compliance with future covenants within 
twelve months. The amendment does 
not have an impact on the Condensed 
Standalone Financial Statements of the 
Entity.
    Ind AS 7 - Statement of Cash Flows and 
Ind AS 107 Financial Instruments:
    Disclosures The amendments clarify 
the characteristics of supplier finance 
arrangements and require additional disclosure 
of such arrangements. The disclosure 
requirements in the amendments are intended 
to assist users of financial statements in 
understanding the effects of supplier finance 
arrangements on an entity’s liabilities, 
cash flows and exposure to liquidity risk.  
The amendment does not have an impact 
on the Condensed Standalone Financial 
Statements of the Entity.
    Ind AS 12 - Income Taxes
    The amendment introduces a mandatory 
exception from recognising and disclosing 
information about deferred tax assets and 
liabilities related to Pillar T wo income taxes. 
When applying the amendment, an entity is 
required to restate comparative information. 
The amendment is not relevant or do not have 
an impact on the Condensed Standalone 
Financial Statements of the Entity.
  B Standards issued not yet effective
    In addition to the above amendment to Ind 
AS 1, the amendment also require that if a 
covenant breach is rectified after the reporting 
date, it will be treated as a non-adjusting 
event This amendment will be applicable from 
annual reporting periods beginning on or after 
the April 01, 2026.

Units held by the Unitholders. The Trust declares and pays distributions in Indian Rupees.
    Under the provisions of the REIT Regulations, Mindspace Business Parks REIT is required to distribute to 
Unitholders not less than 90% of the net distributable cash flows to be met for a given financial year on a cumulative

 Level 2 -  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
 Level 3 -  Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
 The following table presents the fair value measurement hierarchy for assets at September 30, 2025

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
ON REVIEW OF CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
  These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
are being submitted by the Manager pursuant to the 
requirements of Securities and Exchange Board of India 
(Real Estate Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014 as 
amended (the “REIT Regulations”), and pursuant to 
requirement of Regulations 52 and 54 of the SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015, as amended (“Listing Regulations”).
2.  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, 
which is the responsibility of the Manager and approved 
by the Manager’s Board of Directors, have been 
prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
REIT Regulations, Listing Regulations, the recognition 
and measurement principles laid down in Indian 
Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” 
(“Ind AS 34”), prescribed under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 read with relevant rules issued 
thereunder, and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India. Our responsibility is to express a 
conclusion on the Condensed Consolidated Financial 
Statements based on our review.
SCOPE OF REVIEW
3.  We conducted our review of the Condensed Consolidated 
Financial Statements in accordance with the Standard 
on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410 “Review of Interim 
Financial Information Performed by the Independent 
Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (ICAI). A review of interim financial 
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of 
Manager’s personnel responsible for financial and 
accounting matters and applying analytical and other 
review procedures. A review is substantially less in 
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with 
Standards on Auditing issued by ICAI and consequently 
does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would 
become aware of all significant matters that might be 
identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express 
an audit opinion. We have also performed procedures 
in accordance with Regulation 13(5) of the REIT 
Regulations, as amended, to the extent applicable.

Measurement of fair values
The fair values of Investment property, Property, plant and equipment, Investment property under construction and Capital work-
in-progress are solely based on an independent valuation performed by an external property valuer (“independent valuer”), 
having appropriately recognised professional qualification and recent experience in the location and category of the properties 
being valued. Other assets include cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances and other working capital balances which 
are not factored in the discounted cashflow method used in determining the fair value of investment property, investment property 
under construction, property, plant and equipment, capital work-in-progress and intangibles.
Valuation technique
The fair value measurement for all of the Investment property, Property, plant and equipment, Investment property under 
construction and Capital work-in-progress including Pocharam, which has been classified as held for sale (excluding Pocharam) 
has been categorised as a Level 3 fair value based on the inputs to the valuation technique used. The valuer has followed a 
Discounted Cash Flow method, except for valuation of land for future development where the valuer has adopted Comparable 
Sales Method (under Market Approach). The Discounted Cash Flow valuation model considers the present value of net cash 
flows to be generated from the respective properties, taking into account the expected rental growth rate, vacancy period, 
occupancy rate, and lease incentive costs. The expected net cash flows are discounted using the risk adjusted discount rates. 
Among other factors, the discount rate estimation considers the quality of a building and its location (prime vs secondary), tenant 
credit quality, lease terms and investor return expectations from such properties.
The existing buildings in Pocharam are unoccupied. Considering the absence of leasing demand in the near term, and therefore 
no expected income stream and also since the asset is held for sale, the Valuer has opted for the Cost Approach. Under this 
method, the building and plant & machinery components have been valued using the Depreciated Replacement Cost Method. 
The same has been categorised as a Level 3 fair value based on the inputs from the valuation technique used.

resolution passed by the Board of Directors of the 
Manager on November 05, 2025.
 Statement of compliance to Ind AS:
  These Condensed Consolidated financial statements for 
the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025 have 
been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting 
Standard (Ind AS) 34 “Interim Financial Reporting”,as 
prescribed in Rule 2(1)(a) of the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended) to the 
extent not inconsistent with the REIT regulations as more 
fully described above and Note 20A to the condensed 
consolidated financial statements.The accounting 
policies adopted and methods of computation followed 
are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
  The financial statements of all the SPVs and the Trust 
used for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to 
the same reporting date.
 Basis of Consolidation
  Mindspace Business Parks Group consolidates entities 
which it controls. The Condensed Consolidated 
Financial Statements comprise the financial statements 
of Mindspace Business parks REIT and its subsidiary/
SPVs as disclosed in note 1. Control exists when the 
parent has power over the entity, is exposed, or has 
rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the 
entity and has the ability to affect those returns by using 
its power over the entity. Power is demonstrated through 
existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant 
activities, those which significantly affect the entity’s 
returns. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date 
control commences until the date control ceases.
  The procedure for preparing Condensed Consolidated 
Financial Statements of Mindspace Business Parks 
Group are stated below:
 a)  The financial statements of Mindspace Business 
Parks Group are consolidated for like items 
and intragroup balances and transactions for 
assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses 
and cash flows between entities of Mindspace 
Business Parks Group are eliminated in full upon 
consolidation.
 b)  T elangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation 
Limited, which is a shareholder in Intime, KRIT and 
Sundew has not agreed to exchange their equity 
interest in the Subsidiary/SPVs (Intime, KRIT and 
Sundew), thus, Mindspace Business Parks REIT 
has recorded a non-controlling interests for these 
SPVs. The interest of non-controlling shareholders 
may be initially measured either at fair value or at the 
non-controlling interest proportionate share of the 
fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
The choice of measurement basis is made on an 
acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to 
acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling 
interests is the amount of those interests at initial 
recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ 
share of subsequent changes in equity.
 c)  The figures in the notes to accounts and 
disclosures have been Consolidated line by line 
and Inter-company transactions and balances 
including unrealised profits are eliminated in full on 
consolidation.

RN:IN/REIT/19-20/003 (All amounts are in ` Mn unless otherwise stated)
 (c) Use of judgements and estimates
   The preparation of the Condensed Consolidated 
Financial Statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles in India (Ind AS) 
requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual 
results could differ from those estimates.
   Estimates and underlying assumptions are 
reviewed on a periodic basis. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimates are revised and in any future 
periods affected.
   Information about critical judgements in applying 
accounting policies that have the most material 
effect on the amounts recognised in the Condensed 
Consolidated Financial Statements is included in 
the following notes:
  *  Presentation of “Unit Capital” as “Equity” in 
accordance with the REIT Regulations instead 
of compound instrument - note 20
  *  Estimation of lease term for revenue 
recognition - note 3.7 and 3.14
  *  Estimation of useful life of property, plant and 
equipment and investment property - note 3.2 
and 3.3
  *  Estimation of recognition of deferred tax 
assets, availability of future taxable profit 
against which tax losses carried forward can 
be used and income taxes - note 3.10
  *  Impairment of Investment Property, Investment 
property under construction and Property, 
plant and equipment - note 3.4
  *  Interest capitalised to investment property 
under construction - note 3.5 and note 36 in 
notes to accounts.
  *  Significant judgements is involved in the 
allocation cost of acquisition to the identifiable 
assets and liabilities based on their relative 
fair values at the date of acquisition in case of 
asset acquistion - note 42
 d) Current versus non-current classification
   Mindspace Business Parks Group presents assets 
and liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated 
Balance Sheet based on current/ non-current 
classification:
  An asset is treated as current when it is:
  -  Expected to be realised or intended to be sold 
or consumed in normal operating cycle;
  - Held primarily for the purpose of trading;
  -  Expected to be realised within twelve months 
after the reporting period; or
  -  Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted 
from being exchanged or used to settle a 
liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period.
  All other assets are classified as non-current.
  A liability is current when:
  -  It is expected to be settled in normal operating 
cycle;
  - It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
  -  It is due to be settled within twelve months 
after the reporting period; or
  -  There is no right at the end of the reporting 
period to defer the settlement of the liability 
for at least twelve months after the reporting 
period.
   All other liabilities are classified as non-current.
   Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as 
non-current assets and liabilities.
   The operating cycle is the time between the 
acquisition of assets for processing and their 
realisation in cash and cash equivalents. 
Mindspace Business Parks Group has identified 
twelve months as its operating cycle.
 (e) Measurement of fair values
   Fair value is the price that would be received to 
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an 
orderly transaction between market participants 
at the measurement date, regardless of whether 
that price is directly observable or estimated using 
another valuation technique. In estimating the fair 
value of an asset or a liability, Mindspace REIT 
takes into account the characteristics of the asset 
or liability and how market participants would take 
those characteristics into account when pricing the 
asset or liability at the measurement date.
   Mindspace Business Parks Group’s accounting 
policies and disclosures require the measurement 
of fair values, for both financial and non-financial 
assets and liabilities. Mindspace Business Parks

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTD.)
RN:IN/REIT/19-20/003 (All amounts are in ` Mn unless otherwise stated)
Group has an established control framework with 
respect to the measurement of fair values.
   Mindspace Group regularly review significant 
unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. 
If third party information is used to measure 
fair values then the Management assesses the 
evidence obtained from the third parties to support 
the conclusion that such valuations meet the 
requirements of Ind AS, including the level in the 
fair value hierarchy in which such valuations should 
be classified.
   When measuring the fair value of an asset or a 
liability, Mindspace Business Parks Group uses 
observable market data as far as possible. Fair 
values are categorised into different levels in a fair 
value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the 
valuation techniques as follows:
  •  Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities that 
entity can access on measurement date.
  •  Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices 
included in Level 1 that are observable for the 
asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
  •  Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that 
are not based on observable market data 
(unobservable inputs).
   If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an 
asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair 
value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is 
categorised in its entirety in the same level of the 
fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is 
significant to the entire measurement.
3.1 Financial guarantee contracts
  A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires 
the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the 
holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor 
fails to make payments when due in accordance with 
the terms of a debt instrument.
  Financial guarantee contract are measured initially at 
the fair value and in accordance with Ind AS 109 unless 
on a case to case basis Mindspace REIT elects to 
account for financial guarantee as Insurance Contracts. 
Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher 
of the amount of loss allowance determined as per 
impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the amount 
recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative 
amount of income recognised in accordance with the 
principles of Ind AS 115.
3.2 Property, plant and equipment
 (a) Recognition and measurement
   Property, Plant and equipment are stated at cost, 
net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes the 
cost of replacing part of the plant and equipment 
and borrowing costs for acquisition or construction 
of a qualifying asset if the recognition criteria are 
met. The cost of property, plant and equipment 
includes freight, duties, taxes and other incidental 
expenses related to the acquisition or construction 
of the respective assets. Acquisition or construction 
cost is defined as any consideration paid or fair 
value of any other consideration given to acquire 
the asset. The cost of such assets not ready for 
their intended use are disclosed as capital work-in-
progress.
   Advance paid and expenditure incurred on 
acquisition / construction of property, plant and 
equipment which are not ready for their intended 
use at each balance sheet date are disclosed under 
other non-current assets as advances on capital 
account and capital work-in-progress respectively.
 (b) Subsequent expenditure
   Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it 
is probable that the future economic benefits 
associated with the expenditure will flow to 
Mindspace Business Parks Group. Subsequent 
costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount 
or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, 
only when it is probable that future economic 
benefits associated with the item will flow to 
Mindspace Business Parks Group and the cost of 
the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs 
and maintenance are charged to the Condensed 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss during 
the reporting period in which they are incurred.
 (c) Depreciation
   Depreciation / amortisation is provided using 
straight line method as per the useful life of the 
assets estimated by the management over the 
balance useful life. The estimated useful lives of 
the assets, which are higher than, lower than or 
equal to those prescribed under Schedule II of the 
Companies Act 2013, are listed in the table below. 
Depreciation on addition / deletion of property, 
plant and equipment made during the period is 
provided on pro-rata basis from / to the date of 
such addition / deletion.

 (d) De-recognition
   An item of property, plant and equipment is 
derecognised upon disposal or when no future 
economic benefits are expected to arise from 
the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss 
arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of 
property, plant and equipment is determined as 
the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in 
the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss.
3.3 Investment property
 (a) Initial recognition and measurement
   Properties including land, building and other 
assets, which are held either for long-term rental 
yield or for capital appreciation or for both, and 
which are not occupied substantially by Mindspace 
Business Parks Group are classified as investment 
property.
   Investment properties are initially recognised at cost, 
including related transaction costs. Subsequent 
to initial recognition, investment properties are 
measured in accordance with the requirement 
of Ind AS 16’s requirements for cost model i.e. 
Cost less depreciation less impairment losses, 
if any.The cost of Investment properties includes 
acquisition costs or direct development costs, 
import duties and other non-refundable purchase 
taxes, borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
development and any directly attributable cost of 
bringing the asset to its working condition for its 
intended use. The cost of such assets not ready 
for their intended use are disclosed as Investment 
Properties under construction. Advance paid for 
acquisition or development of investment property 
which are not ready for their intended use at each 
balance sheet date are disclosed under other non-
current assets as capital advance.
   Plant and machinery, furniture and fixtures, office 
equipment and electrical equipment’s which are 
physically attached to the commercial buildings 
are considered as part of investment property.
 (b) Subsequent expenditure
   Subsequent expenditure is capitalised to the 
asset’s carrying amount only when it is probable 
that future economic benefits associated with the 
expenditure will flow to Mindspace Business Parks 
Group and the cost of the item can be measured 
reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs 
are expensed when incurred.
 (c) Depreciation
   Depreciation / amortisation is provided using 
straight line method as per the useful life of the 
assets estimated by the management over the

assets except Leasehold Land is estimated to 
be 5% of the original cost of those respective 
assets at SPV .
  (2)  Assets individually costing less than ` 5,000

end of the reporting period with the effect of 
any changes in the estimation accounted for 
on a prospective basis.
  (4)  Useful life of building is restricted to the lease 
term of leasehold land on which the building 
is constructed.
 (d) Fair Value
   Fair value of investment property is based on a 
valuation by an independent valuer who holds a 
recognised and relevant professional qualification 
and has recent experience in the location and 
category of the investment property being valued. 
The fair value of investment property is disclosed in 
the Statement of Net assets at Fair Value.
 (e) De-recognition
   An investment property is derecognised upon 
disposal or when the investment property is 
permanently withdrawn from use and no future 
economic benefits are expected from the disposal. 
Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the 
property (calculated as the difference between 
the net disposal proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset) is included in the Condensed 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the 
period in which the property is de-recognised.
   In determining the amount of consideration from the 
derecognition of Investment properties, the Group 
considers the effects of variable consideration, 
existence of a significant financing component, 
non-cash consideration, and consideration 
payable to the buyer (if any).
3.4 Impairment of assets
  Mindspace Business Parks Group assesses at each 
balance sheet date, whether there is any indication 
that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication 
exists, Mindspace Business Parks Group estimates 
the recoverable amount of the asset. The recoverable 
amount of the assets (or where applicable that of the 
cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs) 
is estimated as the higher of its fair value less cost of 
disposal and its value in use. Value in use is the present 
value of estimated future cash flows (discounted using 
a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset) expected to arise from the 
continuing use of the assets and from its disposal at the 
end of its useful life. In determining fair value less costs 
of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into 
account. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets 
that cannot be tested individually are grouped together 
into the smallest group of assets that generates cash 
inflows from continuing use that are largely independent 
of the cash inflows of other assets or CGU. An impairment 
loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an 
asset or the cash-generating unit to which it belongs, 
exceeds its recoverable amount.  Impairment loss is 
recognised in the Condensed Consolidated Statement 
of Profit and Loss.
  When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the 
carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) 
is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, so that the increased carrying amount does 
264
Half-yearly Report 2025-26
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTD.)
RN:IN/REIT/19-20/003 (All amounts are in ` Mn unless otherwise stated)
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised 
for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A 
reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately 
in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss.
3.5 Borrowing costs
  Borrowing costs that are attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of qualifying assets are 
treated as direct cost and are considered as part of cost 
of such assets. Borrowing costs consist of interest and 
other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the 
borrowing of funds. A qualifying asset is an asset that 
necessarily requires a substantial period of time to get 
ready for its intended use or sale.
  Capitalisation rate used to determine the amount of 
borrowing costs to be capitalised is the weighted average 
interest rate applicable to the general borrowings.
  Interest expense is recognised using the effective 
interest method. The ‘effective interest rate’ is the rate 
that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments 
through the expected life of the financial instrument to 
the amortised cost of the financial liability. In calculating 
interest expense, the effective interest rate is applied to 
the amortised cost of the liability.
  Capitalisation of borrowing costs is suspended during 
the extended period in which active development is 
interrupted. Capitalisation of borrowing costs is ceased 
when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare 
the qualifying asset for its intended use or sale are 
complete.
  All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense 
in the period in which they are incurred.
  Borrowing cost incurred by the SPVs on inter-company 
loans is continued to be capitalised only to the extent 
Mindspace Group has incurred external borrowing cost.
3.6 Inventories
 (a) Measurement of inventory
   Inventories comprise of building material and 
components. Contractual work in progress, in 
respect of third party customers, is classified as 
work in progress. Mindspace Business Parks 
Group measures its inventories at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value.
 (b) Cost of inventories
   The cost of inventories of building material and 
components and work in progress comprise all 
costs of purchase and other costs incurred in 
bringing the inventories to their present location 
and condition. Cost is determined on moving 
weighted average basis.
 (c) Net realisable value
   Net realisable value is the estimated selling price 
in the ordinary course of business, less estimated 
costs of completion and estimated costs necessary 
to make the sale.
3.7 Revenue recognition
 (a) Facility rentals
   Revenue from property leased out under an 
operating lease is recognised on a straight line 
basis over non-cancellable period, except where 
there is an uncertainty of ultimate collection, 
together with any further term for which the tenant 
has the option to continue the lease, where, at the 
inception of the lease, the Company is reasonably 
certain that the tenant will exercise that option.
   Lease incentives granted are recognised as an 
integral part of the total rental income. Contingent 
rents are recognised as revenue in the period in 
which they are earned.
 (b) Revenue from works contractual services
   Revenue from contracts with customers is 
recognised as per Ind AS 115 ‘Revenue from 
contracts with customers’ when a performance 
obligation is satisfied by transfer of promised 
goods or services to a customer in accordance 
with the agreement with the customer. For works 
contract arrangement, the performance obligation 
gets satisfied over time, and therefore, the revenue 
recognition is done by measuring the progress 
towards complete satisfaction of performance 
obligation from time to time as per the agreement 
with the customer. The progress is measured in 
terms of a proportion of actual cost incurred to-
date, to the total estimated cost attributable to the 
performance obligation. The revenue is recognised 
to the extent of transaction price allocated to the 
performance obligation satisfied. Transaction price 
is the amount of consideration to which the Group 
expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring 
goods or services to a customer excluding amounts 
collected on behalf of a third party.
 (c) Maintenance services
   Maintenance income is recognised over a period of 
time for services rendered to the customers.

RN:IN/REIT/19-20/003 (All amounts are in ` Mn unless otherwise stated)
 (d) Revenue from power distribution
   Revenue from power distribution is accounted for 
on the basis of billings to consumers and includes 
unbilled revenues accrued up to the end of the 
accounting year. Mindspace Business Parks Group 
determines surplus/deficit i.e. excess/ shortfall of 
aggregate gain over return on equity entitlement 
for the period in respect of its operations based 
on the principles laid down under the respective 
T ariff Regulations as notified by Maharashtra 
Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), on the 
basis of the tariff order issued by it. In respect of 
such surplus/deficit, appropriate adjustments as 
stipulated under the regulations are made during 
the period. Further, any adjustments that may arise 
on annual performance review by the MERC under 
the tariff regulations is made after the completion of 
such review.
 (e) Finance Lease
   For assets let out under finance lease, Mindspace 
Business Parks Group recognises a receivable at 
an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. 
Rentals received are accounted for as repayment 
of principal and finance income. Minimum lease 
payments receivable on finance leases are 
apportioned between the finance income and 
the reduction of the outstanding receivable. The 
finance income allocated to each period during the 
lease term so as to produce a constant periodic 
rate of interest on the remaining net investment in 
the finance lease.
   Contingent rents are recorded as income in the 
periods in which they are earned.
 (f)  Sale of surplus construction material and 
scrap
   Revenue from sale of surplus construction material 
and scrap is recognised when control of the goods 
are transferred to the customer at an amount that 
reflects the consideration to which the Group 
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods 
net of the expected removal cost.
3.8 Rental Support
  Rental supports that are an integral part of an acquisition 
transaction is treated as a deduction in the acquisition 
cost of such investment properties. Where, the right to 
receive the rental support is spread over a period of time, 
the right to receive the rental support is reduced from the 
acquisition cost and is recognised as a financial asset at 
fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost 
based on effective interest rate method.
3.9 Recognition of dividend income, interest income:
 (i)  Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on 
the date on which Mindspace REIT group has right 
to receive payment is established.
 (ii)  Interest income is recognised on time proportion 
basis, by reference to the principal outstanding 
and the effective interest rate applicable.
 (iii)  Delayed payment charges and interest on delayed 
payments are recognised, on time proportion 
basis, except when there is uncertainty of ultimate 
collection.
3.10 Tax expense
  Income tax expense comprises current tax and deferred 
tax charge or credit. It is recognised in the Condensed 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss except to 
the extent that it relates to an item recognised directly 
in equity or in other comprehensive income in which 
case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised 
in equity and other comprehensive income respectively.
 (a) Current tax
   Current tax comprises the expected tax payable 
or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the 
period/year and any adjustment to the tax payable 
or receivable in respect of previous periods/years. 
The amount of current tax reflects the best estimate 
of the tax amount expected to be paid or received 
after considering the uncertainty, if any, related to 
income taxes. It is measured using tax rates (and 
tax laws) enacted or substantively enacted by end 
of reporting period.
   Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if 
there is a legally enforceable right to set off the 
recognised amounts, and it is intended to realise 
the asset and settle the liability on a net basis or 
simultaneously.
 (b) Deferred tax
   Deferred tax asset/liability is recognised on 
temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the Condensed 
Consolidated Financial Statements and the 
corresponding tax bases used in the computation 
of taxable profit. Deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are measured that are expected to apply to the 
period when the asset is realised or the liability 
is settled, using the tax rates and tax laws that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the end of reporting period. The measurement 
of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the 
266
Half-yearly Report 2025-26
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTD.)
RN:IN/REIT/19-20/003 (All amounts are in ` Mn unless otherwise stated)
tax consequences that would follow from the 
manner in which Mindspace Business Parks Group 
expects, at the end of the reporting period, to 
recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets 
and liabilities.
  Deferred tax is not recognised for:
  -  T emporary differences arising on the initial 
recognition of assets and liabilities in a 
transaction that is not a business combination 
and that affects neither accounting nor taxable 
profit or loss at the time of the transaction; 
and
  -  T emporary differences related to investments 
in subsidiaries, associates, and joint 
arrangements to the extent that Mindspace 
Business Park Group is able to control 
the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
differences and it is probable that they will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future;
   Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised 
for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax 
assets are generally recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profits will be available against which 
those deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are not recognised if the temporary difference 
arises from the initial recognition (other than in a 
business combination) of assets and liabilities in a 
transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor 
the accounting profit.
   The existence of unused tax losses is strong 
evidence that future taxable profit may not be 
available. Therefore, in case of a history of recent 
losses, the Mindspace Business Parks Group 
recognises a deferred tax asset only to the extent 
that it has sufficient taxable temporary differences 
or there is convincing other evidence that sufficient 
taxable profit will be available against which such 
deferred tax asset can be realised.
   The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are 
reviewed at the end of each reporting period and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to 
allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
   Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there 
is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax 
liabilities, and they relate to income taxes levied by 
the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, 
or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle 
current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis 
or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised 
simultaneously.
   For operations carried out under tax holiday 
period (80IA benefits of Income T ax Act, 1961), 
deferred tax assets or liabilities, if any, have been 
established for the tax consequences of those 
temporary differences between the carrying values 
of assets and liabilities and their respective tax 
bases that reverse after the tax holiday ends.
   In the situations where one or more units of the 
Group are entitled to a tax holiday under the tax 
law, no deferred tax (asset or liability) is recognised 
in respect of temporary differences which reverse 
during the tax holiday period, to the extent the 
concerned unit’s gross total income is subject 
to the deduction during the tax holiday period. 
Deferred tax in respect of temporary differences 
which reverse after the tax holiday period is 
recognised in the year in which the temporary 
differences originate. However, the Group restricts 
recognition of deferred tax assets to the extent it 
is probable that sufficient future taxable income 
will be available against which such deferred tax 
assets can be realised. For recognition of deferred 
taxes, the temporary differences which originate 
first are considered to reverse first.
 (c) Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT)
   MAT credit entitlement is recognised as an asset 
only when and to the extent there is convincing 
evidence that normal income tax will be paid during 
the specified period. In the year in which MAT credit 
becomes eligible to be recognised as an asset, 
the said asset is created by way of a credit to the 
Condensed Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss and shown as MAT credit entitlement under 
deferred tax assets. This is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and the carrying amount of 
MAT credit entitlement is written down to the extent 
it is not reasonably certain that normal income tax 
will be paid during the specified period.
3.11 Earnings per unit (EPU):
  The basic earnings per unit is computed by dividing 
the net profit/ (loss) attributable to the unit holders of 
Mindspace REIT by the weighted average number 
of units outstanding during the reporting period. The 
number of units used in computing diluted earnings/ 
(loss) per unit comprises the weighted average units 
considered for deriving basic earnings/ (loss) per unit 
267
MINDSPACE BUSINESS PARKS REIT
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTD.)
RN:IN/REIT/19-20/003 (All amounts are in ` Mn unless otherwise stated)
and also the weighted average number of units which 
could have been issued on the conversion of all dilutive 
potential units.
3.12 Provisions and contingent liabilities
  Provisions are recognised when Mindspace Business 
Parks Group has a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that Mindspace Business Parks Group will be required 
to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation.
  The amount recognised as a provision is the best 
estimate of the consideration net of recoveries if any, 
required to settle the present obligation at the end of 
the reporting period, taking into account the risks and 
uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Provisions 
are determined by discounting the expected future 
cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is 
recognised as finance cost.
  Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a 
possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but 
will probably not, require an outflow of resources. When 
there is a possible obligation of a present obligation in 
respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is 
remote, no provision or disclosure is made.
  Provisions for onerous contracts, i.e. contracts where the 
expected unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations 
under the contract exceed the economic benefits 
expected to be received under it, are recognised when 
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits will be required to settle a present 
obligation as a result of an obligating event, based 
on a reliable estimate of such obligation. If the effect 
of the time value of money is material, provisions are 
discounted.
  Provisions and Contingent Liabilities are reviewed at 
each Balance Sheet date and adjusted to reflect the 
current best estimates.
3.13 Foreign currency transactions and translations
  Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are 
initially recorded at the functional currency spot rate at 
the date of the transactions first qualifies for recognition.
  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies, are translated at the functional currency 
spot rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary foreign 
currency items that are measured in terms of historical 
cost.
  Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation 
of monetary items are recognised in Condensed 
Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.
3.14 Leases
 As a Lessor
  Mindspace Business Parks Group enters into lease 
agreements as a lessor with respect to some of its 
investment properties.
  Leases for which Mindspace Business Parks Group 
is a lessor is classified as finance or operating leases. 
Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the 
contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases 
are classified as operating leases.
  When Mindspace Business Parks Group is an 
intermediate lessor, it accounts for the head lease and 
the sublease as two separate contracts. The sublease is 
classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to 
the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.
  Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease and 
presented as unbilled revenue in other financial assets.
  The lease term is the non-cancellable period together 
with any further term for which the tenant has the option 
to continue the lease, where, at the inception of the 
lease, the Mindspace Group is reasonably certain that 
the tenant will exercise that option.
  Initial direct costs such as brokerage expenses incurred 
specifically to earn revenues from an operating lease are 
capitalised to the carrying amount of leased asset and 
recognised over the lease term on the same basis as 
rental income.
  Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are 
recognised as receivables at the amount of Mindspace 
Business Parks Group’s net investment in the leases. 
Finance lease income is allocated to reporting periods 
so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on 
Mindspace Business Parks Group’s net investment 
outstanding in respect of the leases.
 As a Lessee
  Mindspace Business Parks Group assesses whether a 
contract is or contains a lease, at inception of a contract. 
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys 
the right to control the use of an identified asset for a 
period of time in exchange for consideration. Mindspace 
Business Parks Group recognises a right-of-use asset 
and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all 
268
Half-yearly Report 2025-26
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTD.)
RN:IN/REIT/19-20/003 (All amounts are in ` Mn unless otherwise stated)
lease agreements in which it is the lessee, except for 
short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term 
of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets. 
For these leases, Mindspace Business Parks Group 
recognises the lease payments as an operating expense 
on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless 
another systematic basis is more representative of the 
time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased 
asset are consumed.
  The lease liability is initially measured at the present 
value of the lease payments that are not paid at 
the commencement date, discounted by using the 
rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily 
determined, Mindspace Business Parks Group uses its 
incremental borrowing rate.
  Lease payments included in the measurement of the 
lease liability comprise:
 •  fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed 
payments), less any lease incentives;
 •  variable lease payments that depend on an index 
or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at 
the commencement date;
 •  the amount expected to be payable by the lessee 
under residual value guarantees;
 •  payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if 
the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to 
terminate the lease.
  The lease liability is presented separately as part of 
Financial Liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated 
balance sheet. The lease liability is subsequently 
measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect 
interest on the lease liability (using the effective interest 
method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect 
the lease payments made.
  Mindspace Business Parks Group remeasures the lease 
liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the 
related right-of-use asset) whenever
 •  the lease term has changed or there is a change in 
the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, 
in which case the lease liability is remeasured by 
discounting the revised lease payments using a 
revised discount rate.
 •  the lease payments change due to changes in an 
index or rate or a change in expected payment 
under a guaranteed residual value, in which cases 
the lease liability is measured by discounting the 
revised lease payments using the initial discount 
rate (unless the lease payments change is due to 
a change in a floating interest rate, in which case a 
revised discount rate is used).
 •  a lease contract is modified and the lease 
modification is not accounted for as a separate 
lease, in which case the lease liability is remeasured 
by discounting the revised lease payments using a 
revised discount rate.
  The right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement 
of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments 
made at or before the commencement day and any 
initial direct costs.They are subsequently measured at 
cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses.
  Whenever Mindspace Business Parks Group incurs an 
obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased 
asset, restore the site on which it is located or restore the 
underlying asset to the condition required by the terms 
and conditions of the lease, a provision is recognised 
and measured under Ind AS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent 
Liabilities and Contingent Assets’. The costs are 
included in the related right-of-use asset, unless those 
costs are incurred to produce inventories.
  Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-
line method from the commencement date over 
the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the 
underlying asset.
  Mindspace Business Parks Group applies Ind AS 36 
Impairment of Assets to determine whether a right-of-
use asset is impaired and accounts for any identified 
impairment loss as described in Note 3.5.
  Variable rents that do not depend on an index or rate 
are not included in the measurement the lease liability 
and the right-of-use asset. The related payments are 
recognised as an expense in the period in which the 
event or condition that triggers those payments occurs 
and are included in the line “ other expenses” in the 
Condensed Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
3.15 Financial instruments
 1 Initial recognition and measurement
   Financial assets and/or financial liabilities are 
recognised when Mindspace Business Parks 
Group becomes party to a contract embodying the 
related financial instruments. All financial assets/ 
financial liabilities are initially measured at fair 
value, plus in case of financial assets/ financial

RN:IN/REIT/19-20/003 (All amounts are in ` Mn unless otherwise stated)
liabilities not recorded at fair value through profit or 
loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are attributable 
to the acquisition or issue of financial assets/ 
financial liabilities are added to or deducted, 
as the case may be, from the fair value of such 
assets or liabilities. Transaction costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition of financial assets 
or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or 
loss are recognised immediately in the Condensed 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. Trade 
receivables that do not contain a significant 
financing component are measured at transaction 
price.
 2 Financial assets:
  (a) Classification of financial assets:
   (i)  Mindspace Business Parks Group 
classifies its financial assets in the 
following measurement categories:
    -  those to be measured subsequently 
at fair value (either through other 
comprehensive income, or through 
the Condensed Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss), and
    - those measured at amortised cost.
   (ii)  The classification is done depending 
upon Mindspace Business Parks 
Group’s business model for managing 
the financial assets and the contractual 
terms of the cash flows.
   (iii)  For investments in debt instruments, this 
will depend on the business model in 
which the investment is held.
   (iv)  Mindspace Business Parks Group 
reclassifies debt investments when 
and only when its business model for 
managing those assets changes.
  (b) Subsequent Measurement
   (i) Debt instruments:
     Subsequent measurement of debt 
instruments depends on Mindspace 
Business Parks Group’s business model 
for managing the asset and the cash 
flow characteristics of the asset. There 
are three measurement categories into 
which Mindspace Business Parks Group 
classifies its debt instruments:
    Financial assets at amortised cost
     Financial assets are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost if these 
financial assets are held within a business 
whose objective is to hold these assets 
in order to collect contractual cash flows 
and the contractual terms of the financial 
asset give rise on specified dates to 
cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding.
     Financial assets at fair value through 
other comprehensive income 
(FVTOCI)
     Financial assets are subsequently 
measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income if these financial 
assets are held within a business whose 
objective is achieved by both collecting 
contractual cash flows that give rise on 
specified dates to solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding and by selling 
financial assets.
     Financial assets at fair value through 
the Statement of Profit and Loss 
(FVTPL)
     Financial assets are subsequently 
measured at fair value through the 
Condensed Consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss unless it is measured 
at amortised cost or fair value through 
other comprehensive income on initial 
recognition. The transaction costs 
directly attributable to the acquisition of 
financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss are immediately 
recognised in the Condensed 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss.
   (ii) Equity instruments:
     Mindspace Business Parks Group 
subsequently measures all equity 
investments at fair value. There are two 
measurement categories into which 
Mindspace Business Parks Group 
classifies its equity instruments:
270
Half-yearly Report 2025-26
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTD.)
RN:IN/REIT/19-20/003 (All amounts are in ` Mn unless otherwise stated)
     Investments in equity instruments at 
FVTPL:
     Investments in equity instruments 
are classified as at FVTPL, unless 
Mindspace Business Parks Group 
irrevocably elects on initial recognition 
to present subsequent changes in fair 
value in other comprehensive income for 
equity instruments which are not held for 
trading.
     Investments in equity instruments at 
FVTOCI:
     On initial recognition, Mindspace 
Business Parks Group can make an 
irrevocable election (on an instrument-
by-instrument basis) to present the 
subsequent changes in fair value in 
other comprehensive income. This 
election is not permitted if the equity 
investment is held for trading. These 
elected investments are initially 
measured at fair value plus transaction 
costs. Subsequently, they are measured 
at fair value with gains and losses 
arising from changes in fair value 
recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in the reserve 
for ‘equity instruments through other 
comprehensive income’. The cumulative 
gain or loss is not reclassified to 
Condensed Consolidated Statement 
of Profit and Loss on disposal of the 
investments, but is transferred to 
retained earnings.
  (c) Impairment of financial assets:
    Mindspace Business Parks Group applies the 
expected credit loss model for recognising 
impairment loss on financial assets measured 
at amortised cost, lease receivables, trade 
receivables, other contractual rights to 
receive cash or other financial asset. For 
trade receivables, Mindspace Business 
Parks Group measures the loss allowance at 
an amount equal to lifetime expected credit 
losses. Further, for the purpose of measuring 
lifetime expected credit loss allowance for 
trade receivables, Mindspace Business Parks 
Group has used a practical expedient as 
permitted under Ind AS 109. This expected 
credit loss allowance is computed based on 
a provision matrix which takes into account 
historical credit loss experience and adjusted 
for forward-looking information.
  (d) Derecognition of financial assets:
    A financial asset is primarily derecognised 
when:
   (i)  the right to receive cash flows from the 
asset has expired, or
   (ii)  Mindspace Business Parks Group has 
transferred its rights to receive cash 
flows from the asset; and
    Mindspace Business Parks Group has 
transferred substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset, or
    Mindspace Business Parks Group has neither 
transferred nor retained substantially all 
the risks and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset.
    On derecognition of a financial asset in its 
entirety (other than investments in equity 
instruments at FVOCI), the differences 
between the carrying amounts measured 
at the date of derecognition and the 
consideration received is recognised in 
Condensed Consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss. Any interest in transferred financial 
assets that is created or retained by the SPV 
is recognised as a separate asset or liability.
 3  Financial liabilities and equity instruments
  (a) Classification as debt or equity
    Financial liabilities and equity instruments 
issued by Mindspace Business Parks Group 
are classified according to the substance of 
the contractual arrangements entered into 
and the definitions of a financial liability and 
an equity instrument.
  (b) Equity instruments
    An equity instrument is any contract that 
evidences a residual interest in the assets 
of Mindspace Business Parks Group 
after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity 
instruments are recorded at the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTD.)
RN:IN/REIT/19-20/003 (All amounts are in ` Mn unless otherwise stated)
  (c) Compound financial instruments
    The component parts of compound financial 
instruments issued by Mindspace Business 
Parks Group are classiﬁed separately as 
ﬁnancial liabilities and equity in accordance 
with the substance of the contractual 
arrangements and the deﬁnitions of a 
ﬁnancial liability and an equity instrument. 
A conversion option that will be settled by 
the exchange of a ﬁxed amount of cash or 
another ﬁnancial asset for a ﬁxed number 
of Mindspace Business Parks Group’s own 
equity instruments is an equity instrument.
    At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability 
component is estimated using the prevailing 
market interest rate for similar non-convertible 
instruments. This amount is recorded as a 
liability on an amortised cost basis using the 
effective interest method until extinguished 
upon conversion or at the instrument’s 
maturity date. 
    The conversion option classiﬁed as equity 
is determined by deducting the amount of 
the liability component from the fair value of 
the compound instrument as a whole. This 
is recognised and included in equity, net of 
income tax effects, and is not subsequently 
remeasured.
    Transaction costs that relate to the issue of 
the convertible instruments are allocated 
to the liability and equity components in 
proportion to the allocation of the gross 
proceeds. Transaction costs relating to the 
equity component are recognised directly in 
equity. Transaction costs relating to the liability 
component are included in the carrying 
amount of the liability component and are 
amortised over the lives of the convertible 
instrument using the effective interest method.
  (d) Financial Liabilities
   •  Recognition, measurement and 
classification
     Financial liabilities are classified as 
either held at a) fair value through the 
Condensed Consolidated Statement 
of Profit and Loss, or b) at amortised 
cost. Management determines the 
classiﬁcation of its financial liabilities at 
the time of initial recognition or, where 
applicable, at the time of reclassification.
     Mindspace Business Parks Group’s 
financial liabilities include trade and 
other payables, loans and borrowings 
and derivative financial instruments. 
Subsequent measurement of financial 
liabilities depends on their classification 
as fair value through the Condensed 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss or at amortised cost. All changes in 
fair value of financial liabilities classified 
as FVTPL are recognised in the 
Condensed Consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss. Amortised cost category 
is applicable to loans and borrowings, 
trade and other payables. After initial 
recognition the financial liabilities are 
measured at amortised cost using the 
Effective Interest Rate method.
   • Derecognition
     A financial liability is derecognised 
when the obligation under the liability 
is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
Gains and losses are recognised in the 
Condensed Consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss when the liabilities are 
derecognised.
 4 Offsetting of financial instruments
   Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset 
and presented on net basis in the Balance Sheet 
when there is a currently enforceable legal right 
to offset the recognised amounts and there is an 
intention either to settle on a net basis or to realise 
the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
 5 Embedded derivatives
   Derivatives embedded in a host contract that is 
an asset within the scope of Ind AS 109 are not 
separated. Financial assets with embedded 
derivatives are considered in their entirety when 
determining whether their cash flows are solely 
payment of principal and interest.
   Embedded derivatives closely related to the 
host contracts are not separated. Derivatives 
embedded in all other host contract are separated 
only if the economic characteristics and risks of the 
embedded derivative are not closely related to the 
economic characteristics and risks of the host and 
are measured at fair value through profit or loss.

RN:IN/REIT/19-20/003 (All amounts are in ` Mn unless otherwise stated)
3.16 Cash and cash equivalents
  Cash and cash equivalents comprises of cash at banks 
and on hand, demand deposits, other short-term, highly 
liquid investments with original maturities of three months 
or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of 
cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value.
3.17 Statement of Cash flow
  Cash flow is reported using the indirect method, 
whereby net profit before tax is adjusted for the effects 
of transactions of a non-cash nature and any deferrals 
or accruals of past or future cash receipts or payments. 
The cash flows from operating, investing and financing 
activities of Mindspace Business Parks Group are 
segregated.
  Initial direct costs such as brokerage expenses incurred 
specifically to earn revenues from an operating lease 
which are capitalised to the carrying amount of leased 
assets are considered as cashflows used in investing 
activity.
  For the purpose of the Condensed Consolidated 
Statement of Cash Flow, cash and cash equivalents 
consist of cash and short-term deposits, as defined 
above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are 
considered an integral part of Mindspace Business 
Parks Group’s cash management.
  As per para 8 of Ind AS 7 “where bank overdrafts which 
are repayable on demand form an integral part of an 
entity’s cash management, bank overdrafts are included 
as a component of cash and cash equivalents. Bank 
overdraft, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance 
Sheet, is included as ‘borrowings’ under Financial 
Liabilities.
3.18 Employee benefits plan
  Disclosure pursuant to Ind AS – 19 
‘Employee benefits’
 (1) Short term employee benefits
   All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve 
months of rendering the service are classified as 
short-term employee benefits such as salaries, 
wages, etc. and are recognised in the period in 
which the employee rendered the related services. 
The undiscounted amount of short-term employee 
benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the 
services rendered by employees is recognised as 
an expense during the period.
 (2) Long term employee benefits
  Defined contribution plans
   Contributions to defined contribution schemes 
such as provident fund are charged as an expense 
based on the amount of contribution required to be 
made as and when services are rendered by the 
employees. Mindspace Business Parks Group’s 
provident fund contribution, in respect of certain 
employees, is made to a government administered 
fund and charged as an expense. The above 
benefits are classified as defined contribution 
schemes as Mindspace Business Parks Group has 
no further defined obligations beyond the monthly 
contributions.
  Defined benefit plan
   Mindspace Business Parks Group’s gratuity benefit 
scheme is a defined benefit plan. Mindspace 
Business Parks Group has determined the gratuity 
liability based on internal calculation based on the 
number of years completed and last drawn basic 
salary as mentioned in the Payment of Gratuity 
Act, 1972. The liability or asset recognised in the 
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet in respect 
of defined benefit gratuity plans is the present value 
of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the 
reporting period less the fair value of plan assets, 
if any. The defined benefit obligation is calculated 
annually by actuaries SPVs using the projected unit 
credit method.
   The present value of the defined benefit obligation 
denominated in ` is determined by discounting 
the estimated future cash outflows by reference to 
market yields at the end of the reporting period on 
government bonds that have terms approximating 
to the terms of the related obligation. The net 
interest cost is calculated by applying the discount 
rate to the net balance of the defined benefit 
obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This 
cost is included in employee benefit expense in the 
Condensed Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss.
   Other long term employee benefits - 
Compensated absences
   Benefits under compensated absences are 
accounted as other long-term employee benefits. 
Mindspace Business Parks Group has determined 
the liability for compensated absences based on 
internal calculation which is determined on the

MINDSPACE BUSINESS PARKS REIT
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTD.)
RN:IN/REIT/19-20/003 (All amounts are in ` Mn unless otherwise stated)
basis of leave credited to employee’s account and 
the last drawn salary. Mindspace Business Parks 
Group’s net obligation in respect of compensated 
absences is the amount of benefit to be settled in 
future, that employees have earned in return for 
their service in the current and previous years. 
The benefit is discounted to determine its present 
value. The obligation is measured on the basis of 
an actuarial valuation by SPVs using the projected 
unit credit method. Remeasurement is recognised 
in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise. 
Compensated absences which are not expected 
to occur within twelve months after the end of the 
period in which the employee renders the related 
services are recognised as a non-current liability.
3.19  Earnings before finance costs, depreciation 
and amortisation, regulatory income / expense, 
exceptional items and tax
  Mindspace Business Parks Group has elected to 
present earnings before interest, depreciation and 
amortisation, regulatory income / expense, exceptional 
items and tax as a separate line item on the face of 
the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss. Mindspace Business Parks Group measures 
earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation, 
regulatory income / expense, exceptional items and tax 
on the basis of profit/ (loss) from continuing operations.
3.20 Subsequent events
  If the Mindspace Business Parks Group receives 
information after the reporting period, but prior to the 
date of approved for issue, about conditions that existed 
at the end of the reporting period, it will assess whether 
the information affects the amounts that it recognises 
in its Condensed Consolidated financial statements. 
The Group will adjust the amounts recognised in its 
financial statements to reflect any adjusting events after 
the reporting period and update the disclosures that 
relate to those conditions in light of the new information. 
For non-adjusting events after the reporting period, the 
Group will not change the amounts recognised in its 
condensed consolidated financial statements, but will 
disclose the nature of the non-adjusting event and an 
estimate of its financial effect, or a statement that such 
an estimate cannot be made, if applicable.
3.21 Errors and estimates
  Mindspace Business Parks Group revises its accounting 
policies if the change is required due to a change in Ind 
AS or if the change will provide more relevant and reliable 
information to the users of the Condensed Consolidated 
financial statement. Changes in accounting policies are 
applied retrospectively.
  A change in an accounting estimate that results in 
changes in the carrying amounts of recognised assets 
or liabilities or to profit or loss is applied prospectively in 
the period(s) of change.

if this results in the non-controlling interests having a 
deficit balance.
3.24 Distribution to unit holders
  The Group recognises a liability to make distributions 
to Unitholders when the distribution is authorised and 
a legal obligation has been created. As per the REIT 
Regulations, a distribution is authorised when it is 
approved by the Board of Directos of the Manager. A 
corresponding amount is recognised directly in other 
equity/Unit Capital.
3.25 Distribution Policy
  The Net Distributable Cash Flows of Mindspace 
REIT are based on the cash flows generated from 
Mindspace REIT’s assets and investments. In terms of 
the Distribution Policy of Mindspace REIT and the REIT 
Regulations, not less than 90% of the NDCF of each of 
the Asset SPVs/HoldCo are required to be distributed 
to Mindspace REIT , in proportion of Mindspace REIT’s 
shareholding in the Asset SPV/HoldCo, subject to 
applicable provisions of the Companies Act 2013.

SPVs/HoldCo may be in the form of dividends, interest 
income, repayment of debt by SPVs to REIT , proceeds 
of any capital reduction or buyback from the Asset SPVs 
or as specifically permitted under the Trust Deed or in 
such other form as may be permissible under the REIT 
Regulations. Such SPV Distributions shall be declared 
and made for every quarter of a Financial Year in terms 
of the Distribution Policy.
3.26  Non-current assets held for sale and Discontinued 
Operations:
  Discontinued operation is a component of the Company 
that has been disposed of or classified as held for sale 
and represents a major line of business or geographies. 
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if 
their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use. This 
condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly 
probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in 
its present condition.
  Management must be committed to the sale which 
should be expected to qualify for recognition as 
a completed sale within one year from the date of 
classification.
3.27 Joint Development Accounting:
  Development rights received under joint development 
arrangements is measured at the fair value of 
the estimated construction service rendered to 
the landowner and accounted as an asset with 
corresponding obligation for construction service. The 
cost as and when incurred along with the corresponding 
revenue are recognised in the statement of Profit and 
Loss as per Ind AS 115 ‘Revenue from contracts with 
customers’.
  The Developmental Rights will be grouped as Land under 
Investment Property post execution of Conveyance 
Deed in the name of the Company. Transaction cost 
such as stamp duty, taxes etc. are considered as part of 
land cost as and when incurred.
3.28 Recent Pronouncements
  Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA ”) notifies new 
standards or amendments to the existing standards 
under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 
as issued from time to time.
 A New and amended standards:
   The accounting policies adopted and methods of 
computation followed are consistent with those 
of the previous financial year, except for items 
disclosed below:
   Ind AS 21 - The Effects of Changes in Foreign 
Exchange Rates
   On May 07, 2025, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs 
issued amendment to Ind AS 21 to address 
situations where currency lacks exchangeability. 
The amendement specifies how an entity should 
assess whether a currency is exchangeable and 
275
MINDSPACE BUSINESS PARKS REIT
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTD.)
RN:IN/REIT/19-20/003 (All amounts are in ` Mn unless otherwise stated)
how it should determine a spot exchange rate 
when exchangeability is lacking. The amendments 
also require disclosure of information that enables 
users of its financial statements to understand 
how the currency not being exchangeable into the 
other currency affects, or is expected to affect, the 
entity’s financial performance, financial position 
and cash flows.
   When applying the amendment, an entity is not 
required to restate comparative information. The 
amendment is not relevant or do not have an 
impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the Group.
   On August 13, 2025, the Ministry of Corporate 
Affairs has issued amendments to the following 
standards:
  Ind AS 1- Presentation of Financial Statements
   MCA issued amendments to paragraphs 69 to 
76 of Ind AS 1 to specify the requirements for 
classifying liabilities as current or non-current. The 
amendments clarify:
  • What is meant by a right to defer settlement
  •  That a right to defer must exist at the end of 
the reporting period
  •  That classification is unaffected by the 
likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral 
right
  •  That only if an embedded derivative in a 
convertible liability is itself an equity instrument 
would the terms of a liability not impact its 
classification
   In addition, a requirement has been introduced 
to require disclosure when a liability arising from 
a loan agreement is classified as non-current and 
the entity’s right to defer settlement is contingent 
on compliance with future covenants within twelve 
months.
   The amendment does not have an impact on the 
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of 
the Group.
   Ind AS 7 - Statement of Cash Flows and Ind AS 
107 Financial Instruments: Disclosures
   The amendments clarify the characteristics 
of supplier finance arrangements and require 
additional disclosure of such arrangements. The 
disclosure requirements in the amendments are 
intended to assist users of financial statements 
in understanding the effects of supplier finance 
arrangements on an entity’s liabilities, cash flows 
and exposure to liquidity risk.
   The amendment does not have an impact on the 
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of 
the Group.
  Ind AS 12 - Income Taxes
   The amendment introduces a mandatory exception 
from recognising and disclosing information about 
deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar 
T wo income taxes. When applying the amendment, 
an entity is required to restate comparative 
information. The amendment is not relevant 
or do not have an impact on the Condensed 
Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group.
   The above amendments are effective for 
annual reporting periods beginning on or after  
April 01, 2025.
 B Standards issued not yet effective
   In addition to the above amendment to Ind AS 
1, the amendment also require that if a covenant 
breach is rectified after the reporting date, it will be 
treated as a non-adjusting event.
   This amendment will be applicable from annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after the  
April 01, 2026.

determined, will have a material and adverse 
effect on MBPPL’s results of operations or 
financial condition.
  c)  MBPPL received a communication (alleged 
reminder) from Pune Municipal Corporation 
(PMC) demanding an amount of ` 157 
Mn allegedly due from MBPPL based 
on objections by internal audit report of 
Pune Municipal Corporation. MBPPL, has 
submitted a letter denying all allegation of 
PMC, as MBPPL has not been served with 
any document referred to the said PMC letter. 
Subsequently MBPPL addressed one more 
communication stating that MBPPL would 
be in a position to submit their reply upon 
receipt of the details of amount demanded as 
per their reply submitted which states that if 
any principal outstanding is due/recoverable, 
MBPPL agrees to make the said payment and 
sought detailed clarification on the interest 
amount. By letter dated July 20, 2019 to 
MBPPL, PMC provided the copy of the audit 
report to MBPPL and requested MBPPL 
to provide its clarifications in respect of 
objectionable issues and furnish the challans 
in lieu of payment of the recoverable amount. 
By letter dated August 17, 2021 to the architect 
firm and another, PMC stated that it has not 
received any clarifications and provided the 
challans of amounts by assessing interest 
thereon and required submission of challan/
receipt towards payment of an amount 
of ` 183.60 Mn recoverable against all 
objectionable issues. By its reply letter dated 
September 06, 2021 to PMC, MBPPL has 
again reiterated that the earlier PMC letter 
dated February 04, 2019 and the PMC letter 
dated August 17, 2021 are addressed to the 
wrong persons and informed PMC of the non-
receipt of relevant information and documents 
from PMC as requested by MBPPL earlier.

impugned challans and letter forthwith. By 
the said letter MBPPL further stated that if the

without any liability for interest thereon or for 
any other payments relating to the subject 
and to provide an opportunity of hearing

March 10, 2022, PMC informed MBPPL that 
it has not accepted the cheque issued by 
MBPPL vide its letter dated January 25, 2022 
and requested MBPPL to issue demand draft 
for the amount as per the Challans and make 
the payment to PMC at the earliest.
    On April 07, 2022 MBPPL submitted a reply/
letter to PMC enclosing a demand draft 
as desired by the PMC, for an amount of  
` 26.64 Mn towards the payment as set out 
in MBPPL`s earlier communications. Vide

 10 Gigaplex
  a)  Regular Civil Suit had been filed before 
the Hon. Civil Judge (J.D) Vashi at Central 
Business District by an Education Society 
(the Plaintiff) who is claiming rights in existing 
school structure, claiming its area as 500 
square metres and its existence since more 
than 30 years, seeking an injunction not to 
dispossess him. Gigaplex has filed its reply 
opposing the Plaintiff’s prayers. After hearing 
the parties, the Hon’ble Judge at the Vashi 
Court had rejected the Plaintiff’s Injunction 
Application by Order dated August 20, 2018 
(Order). Thereafter the Plaintiff has filed an 
appeal in Thane District Court. The Plaintiff’s 
Appeal filed in Thane District Court has been 
transferred to Belapur Court is still pending 
for Arguments in Appellant’s Applications 
for injunction and status quo before relevant 
court in Belapur. Suit is pending and Appeal is 
dismissed on July 06, 2024. In management 
view, the estimate of liability arising out of the 
same is remote, no provision has been taken.
  b)  Gigaplex, one of the SPV’s of Mindspace 
REIT , has received notice dated December 
11, 2023 (Demand Notice) issued by MIDC 
demanding differential premium of ` 527.75 
Mn on account of change in shareholding 
pattern i.e. participation of the Gigaplex into 
the Mindspace REIT . In the meantime, in view 
of the permission for subleasing required 
by the Gigaplex from MIDC in respect of 
proposed transactions by the Gigaplex, and 
pending the determination as to whether the 
said demand is payable at all to MIDC and 
whether payable by the Gigaplex, the Gigaplex 
has obtained a bank guarantee in favour of 
MIDC for the said demand in order that the 
said permission for subleasing is obtained by 
the Gigaplex from MIDC. Group is of the view 
that the said demand is not payable by the 
Gigaplex. The Gigaplex had sent intimation 
to MIDC of the participation by the Gigaplex 
into Mindspace REIT (Transaction) on July 
15, 2020 (i.e. pre-Transaction) and also on 
October 05, 2020 (i.e. post-Transaction) and 
also explained in detail the rationale why the 
Transaction ought to be treated as a ‘Formal 
Transfer’ under the circulars issued by MIDC 
and only a standard transfer fee is payable 
which will be a nominal amount only and 
not such a large amount as per the Demand 
Notice. The Gigaplex has sent its response to 
the Demand Notice on January 02, 2024 and 
once again reiterated its aforesaid position 
and thus the demand for differential premium 
is erroneous and unwarranted and has 
requested MIDC, inter alia, to withdraw/revoke 
the Demand Notice. A Counter Guarantee 
dated June 07, 2024 has been issued by Ivory 
Properties Trust and K Raheja Corp Private 
Limited (Counter Guarantors) to Gigaplex for 
an amount of ` 527.75 Mn in order to cover, 
in case any payments, may be required to be 
made to MIDC. In this regard, the Gigaplex 
has been legally advised that under the MIDC 
Circulars issued with respect to the change in 
shareholding of any lessee company of MIDC, 
which Circulars are also referred to in the 
REIT Circular issued by MIDC, as long as the 
natural persons belonging to the same family 
holding directly or indirectly in the lessee 
company by reckoning the shareholding 
within the shareholding entity does not fall 
below 51% post transfer of shares of the 
lessee company as compared to the position 
prior to the transfer of shares, the transfer 
premium payable will be a nominal sum being 
treated as a Formal Transfer under the MIDC 
Circulars.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTD.)
RN:IN/REIT/19-20/003 (All amounts are in ` Mn unless otherwise stated)
    In pursuance of REIT acquiring entire 
shareholding of a Gigaplex, the position with 
respect to satisfying the said 51% holding is 
fully satisfied and the Gigaplex has furnished 
substantial evidence and documents in 
support of the same to MIDC. Therefore, 
in Group’s view there is no such premium 
payable as demanded by MIDC except 
a nominal transfer premium as a Formal 
Transfer for which the Gigaplex has made 
provision of ` 6 Mn in the books of account. 
Subsequently, the Industries Department 
of Government of Maharashtra (controlling 
Ministry for MIDC) pronounced that, MIDC 
has the powers to amend its REIT circular, as 
deemed necessary. Such modifications are 
done through the process of relevant proposal 
being discussed in the MIDC Board Meeting 
for concerned approval. The matter is under 
approval process at MIDC. Considering 
pendency in the disposal of this matter, in 
management’s view, no further provision is 
presently required to be made.
    The said Transaction is in pursuance of 
swap of shares of the Gigaplex by inter alias 
by the Sponsor Group i.e. K. Raheja Corp 
Pvt. Ltd. and Ivory Property Trust (Erstwhile 
Shareholders) in exchange for the units of the 
Mindspace Business Park REIT . The Erstwhile 
shareholders have agreed to provide an 
indemnity and also make good the differential 
premium or any other amount which is finally 
decided by MIDC in this respect and in the 
process of execution of a counter guarantee 
in favour of the Gigaplex for such demand 
liability, if any, and any expenditure as may 
be incurred by the Gigaplex for obtaining the 
bank guarantee or any security in respect 
of the bank guarantee and any other cost, 
whether direct or indirect, as may be incurred 
by the Gigaplex in relation thereto.
 11 Horizonview
   RPIL has executed a Deed of Conveyance dated 
August 19, 2023 (first conveyance), in favour of 
Horizonview for transfer of 78% undivided interest in 
the Land, which has been submitted for registration 
with the concerned Sub-Registrar of Assurances 
Kundrathur (Registrar) Chennai. Further, RPIL 
has also executed a Deed of Conveyance dated 
September 02, 2023 (second conveyance) in 
favour of Horizonview for transfer of its units in 
the building along with the corresponding 22% 
Undivided Interest in the Land. Both documents 
have been submitted for registration with the 
Sub - Registrar of Assurances Kundrathur 
(Registrar). The Registrar has issued demand 
notices for deficit of stamp duty and registration 
fees aggregating to ` 221.28 Mn in respect of the 
conveyance deeds and most of the demand is with 
respect to the Registrar’s view that there is transfer 
of the building besides transfer of Land under the 
first Conveyance. Horizonview has responded to 
the demand notices, objecting to the same as it 
has constructed the building together with plant 
and machinery in the building for itself, on its own 
account and therefore there is no transfer from 
RPIL. As the transaction, which is subject matter of 
deed of conveyance, is only for transfer of the 78% 
undivided right, title and interest in the land and not 
the building/machinery, in view of management, 
the demand is not tenable. Further, regarding the 
22% conveyance, the demand has been made 
for stamp duty and registration fees on the TDS 
amount deducted which demand is not tenable 
since the stamp duty and registration charges 
have been paid on the entire consideration which 
includes the TDS amount under the conveyance 
deed. The Registrar further issued letters from 
time to time for payment of deficit of stamp duty 
and registration fee. Horizonview responded 
to the letters/demand notices, objecting to the 
same and requested for release of documents. 
Horizonview has the right to appeal to a higher 
authority. The matter is pending. By subsequent 
orders, the Deputy Inspector General Registration 
has issued demand notice for deficit stamp duty 
and registration fees aggregating to ` 279.95 Mn in 
respect of the conveyance deeds. Horizonview has 
filed appeals against the orders.
   Horizonview filed 2 writ petitions in the Madras 
High Court praying for the appeals to be heard by 
the Inspector General of Registration. The Madras 
High Court disposed of the matters, directing the 
Inspector General of Registration to hear and 
dispose of the appeals within a period of eight (8) 
weeks from the date of its order. Vide order dated 
July 09, 2025, the Inspector General of Registration 
allowed the Horizonview’s appeal for the second 
conveyance and set aside the order of the Deputy 
Inspection General Registration. Subsequently the

B. Measurement of fair values
 The section explains the judgement and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial instruments that are:
 a) recognised and measured at fair value
 b) measured at amortised cost and for which fair values are disclosed in the financial statements.
   T o provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the Group has classified its 
financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the accounting standard. An explanation of each level is 
mentioned below:
 Fair value hierarchy
 •  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can 
access at the measurement date;
 •  Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly or indirectly; and
 •  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
  The following table presents the fair value measurement hierarchy of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on recurring 
basis as at September 30, 2025.

considered to be equivalent to present value of 
the future contracted cashflows discounted at the

49 (a)  The figures for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 are the balancing figures between the figures in respect of 
the half year ended September 30, 2025 and the figures for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, which are subjected to 
limited review.
 (b)  The figures for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 are the balancing figures between the figures in respect of the 
half year ended September 30, 2024 and the figures for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which were subjected to 
limited review.
50  Considering the weak micro market dynamics and no immediate demand visibility and also this being a non-core asset, 
the Board of Directors of the Manager, at its meeting held on January 29, 2024 had approved initiation of the process of 
sale of Mindspace Pocharam, comprising all piece and parcel of land admeasuring approximately 26 acres along with the 
structures thereon located at Mindspace Pocharam, T elangana,. This investment property is part of “Real Estate” segment 
of the Group. An active programme for sale is in place. On conclusion of the process, a detailed proposal shall be placed 
before the Board for its consideration and approval and subject to such other approvals as may be required. The asset, which 
was expected to be sold within 12 months, was classified as a held for sale and presented separately in the balance sheet. 
The sale process has been delayed beyond 12 months as the Management continues to engage with potential buyers to 
secure a competitive offer that reflects the fair value of the asset. Due to weak micro-market conditions and limited demand, 
the divestment has not been completed in the aforesaid period. The management is pursuing discussions with interested 
parties and remains fully committed to completing the sale and continues to actively pursue suitable opportunities.
  The Group estimated the fair value less costs of disposal of this asset based on the external fair valuation, which was less 
than the carrying value as on September 30, 2025. Accordingly, the asset was recognised at the lower of carrying value and 
fair value less cost of disposal resulting into impairment loss of ` 447.56 Mn, which was recognised in the statement of profit 
and loss for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025 as an Exceptional Item.

thereunder, before the Hon’ble National Company Law Tribunal, Mumbai Bench (‘NCLT’) seeking confirmation for reduction

1.6 A SSUMPTIONS, DEPARTURES AND RESERVATIONS 
 
This Valuation Report has been prepared on the basis of the assumptions within the 
instructions (Key Assumptions, Qualifications, Limitations and Disclosures) detailed after this 
section of this report. The development mix, built up area, land area and lease details such as 
lease rent, lease commencement and lease end date, lock -in period, escalation terms, etc. 
pertaining to the Project is based on the appropriate relevant documents , which has been 
provided by the Client and the same has been adopted for the purpose of this valuation. The 
total developable/developed area, leasable area, site/plot area considered for this valuation 
exercise is based on the Architect’s Certificate shared by the Clie nt and the same has been 
checked against the approvals/layout plans/building plans provided by the Client. However, 
no additional verification and physical measurement for the purpose of this valuation exercise 
has been undertaken. 
 
1.7 G ENERAL COMMENT  
 
A valuation is an estimation of price, not a guarantee. By necessity , it requires the Valuer to 
make subjective judgments that, even if logical and appropriate, may differ from those made 
by a purchaser, or another valuer. Historically it has been considered that valuers may properly 
conclude within a range of possible values.  
 
The purpose of the valuation does not alter the approach to the valuation.  
 
Property values can change substantially, even over short periods of time, and thus the 
valuation of the Project herein could differ significantly if the date of valuation was to change. 
 
This report should not be relied upon for any other purpose other than for which this valuation 
exercise has been undertaken for. 
 
1.8 C ONFIDENTIALITY 
 
The contents of this Valuation Report are intended for the specific purpose stated. 
Consequently, and in accordance with current practice, no responsibility is accepted to any 
other party in respect of the whole or any part of its contents - except as maybe required in 
connection with the disclosure of valuation of assets, forming part of the portfolio of Mindspace 
REIT, under the applicable law.

affect the current or future occupation, development of the Project. The estimate assumes 
that the Project Site is free from rot, infestation, structural or latent defect and no currently 
known deleterious or hazardous materials or suspect techniques will be used in the 
construction of or subsequent alterations or additions to the property and comments made in 
the property details do not purport to express an opinion about, or advice upon, the condition 
of uninspected parts and should not be taken as making an implied representation or 
statement about such parts. 
12. Town Planning 
and Statutory 
Considerations 
The Valuer has not made formal search  but has generally relied on readily available 
information to general public. Valuation Report is on current use/ current state basis of the 
property and the Valuer has not considered any Government proposals for road widening or 
compulsory purchase/ acquisition, or any other statute in force that might affect the Project. 
13. Future Market 
Development 
and Prospects 
The Valuer has not accounted any future market development and prospects to the extent 
information known to the Valuer as on the date of valuation. The Valuer does not warrant that 
such statements are accurate or correct. 
14. Option or Pre-
Emption Rights 
and 
Encumbrances 
 
The projects can have some encumbrances created in favor of the lenders in ordinary course 
of the business. Unless disclosed and recorded by the Client, the Projects are considered to 
possess good and marketable titles and are free from any unusually onerous encumbrances 
with no option or preemption rights in relation to the assets, based on the information given 
in the Title Reports prepared by Legal Counsel of the Client. The Valuer has not checked and 
verified the title of the Projects. 
15. Disclaimer The estimate of Market Value is based on documents/information shared by the Client. The 
Valuer has not made any allowances with respect to any existing or proposed local legislation 
relating to taxation on realization of the sale value of the Project.  
The Valuer has relied on the measurements and information provided at all times, whether 
from public and private sources, and has ensured to the best of their ability the correctness 
and the validity of the same, by cross checking from various sources. Whilst every effort has 
been taken to provide authentic data and analysis, the Valuer, and/or any of their associated 
companies and/or their employees are not responsible for any loss, major or minor incurred 
on the basis of the information and analyses provided, nor are liable to any damages in any 
form or shape. 
Given the confidential nature of real estate transactions, transaction details for most 
properties, which are privately actually transacted, are not in the public domain. 
Consequently, there is reliance on information from market sources, which may not be 
completely accurate. Thus, information has been crosschecked independently from other 
market sources to ascertain the broad credibility of information being provided by the market 
sources. This assignment has been done on best effort and knowledge basis. 
For ease and simplicity of representation, certain figures may have been rounded.

2 V ALUATION APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY 
 
2.1 V ALUATION STANDARDS ADOPTED 
 
This Report is prepared in accordance and compliance with: 
 
1. Securities and Exchange Board of India (Real Estate Investment Trusts) Regulations, 
2014 as amended from time to time (“SEBI Regulations 2014”), including Regulation 21 
Sub-Regulation (3) and mandatory minimum disclosures as specified in Schedule V of 
these SEBI Regulation 2014, 
2. Companies (Registered Valuers and Valuation) Rules, 2017 as amended from time to 
time (“Valuer Rules 2017”), including reporting requirements as specified in Rule 18 to 
these rules, 
3. International Valuation Standards 2025 effective 31 January 2025 (“IVS 2025”) as set out 
by International Valuation Standards Committee (“ IVSC”) and adopted by Royal 
Institution of Chartered Surveyors (“ RICS”) presented in the RICS Valuation Standards 
and Guidelines 2025 effective 31 January 2025  (“RICS Red Book 202 5”), subject to 
variation to meet local established law, custom, practice, and market conditions. 
 
2.2 B ASIS OF VALUATION 
 
Basis of valuation of the Project is Market Value as defined by IVSC and adopted by Royal 
Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) to be: “The estimated amount for which an asset or 
liability should exchange on the valuation date between a willing buyer and a willing seller in 
an arm’s -length transaction after proper marketing and where the parties had each acted 
knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion”. 
 
2.3 A PPROACH AND METHODOLOGY 
 
The purpose of this valuation exercise is to estimate the Market Value of the Project, which is 
a real estate asset. Market Value of the real estate asset can be estimated using different 
approaches and methodologies.  
 
Income Approach: Under this valuation approach, the income generating potential of the real 
estate asset is estimated while opining on its market value.  This approach is typically adopted 
for assets that are income -generating (completed and operational with multiple ten ancies, 
multiple strata units that can be sold with phased/milestone-based revenue collections, among 
others). For income-generating assets with single/multiple tenancies, the discounted cash flow 
entailing term and reversion method is most commonly adopted. 
 
Market Approach: Under this valuation approach, the price that an asset could fetch in an 
open market is estimated.  This approach is typically adopted for homogeneous assets in their 
micro-market and are typically traded on a unit basis.  The most commonly adopted valuation 
method under this valuation approach is the Listed Transaction / Listed Quoted Instances 
Method, also commonly known as the Direct Comparison or the Comparable Sales/Quoted 
Instances Method. 
 
Cost Approach: Under this valuation approach, the cost required to create an asset of similar 
or equal utility is estimated.  This valuation approach is typically adopted for real estate assets 
that can be clearly broken down into constituent elements, namely land and built structures.  
The most commonly adopted valuation method under this valuation approach is the Physical 
Method, also commonly known as Land and Building Method, which typically entails 
estimation of the underlying land value (while normally adopting the Market Approach) and 
the built structures (while adopting the Depreciated Replacement Cost Method) separately.

Half-yearly Report 2025-26
Table 2.1: Different Valuation Methodologies and Description 
Sl. Valuation Methodology Description 
1. Comparable Sales / 
Quoted Instances Method 
This method is based on comparing the subject property directly with other 
comparable property transactions (actually been sold in the vicinity or are 
offered for sale). Efforts would be made to collect transacted instances. In 
case of non -availability of transacted instances in the micro -market, the 
opinion will be offered based on the available asking/quoted instances in 
the market with appropriate adjustments for margin for negotiation. Given 
the homogeneous nature of real estate properties, appropriate 
adjustments are usually required to allow for any qualitative and 
quantitative differences that may affect the price likely to be achieved by 
the property under consideration. These adjustments are typically made 
in the form of premium and/or discount factors for various property 
attributes, which affect the value. This method demonstrates what buyers 
have historically been willing to pay (and sellers willing to accept) for 
similar properties in an open and competitive market and is particularly 
useful in estimating the value of the land and properties that are typically 
traded on a unit basis.  This method is a fair estimate of the prevailing 
prices. 
2. Depreciated Replacement 
Cost Method 
Replacement cost method is based on the construction cost of assets. 
The cost to be estimated is the cost of construction as per the construction 
status at the valuation date. This is based on the inspection of the facility 
and inputs provided by the Clien t; however, no structural survey will be 
conducted. Appropriate depreciation rates will be applied based on 
schedules given under the Indian Companies Act. This is generally used 
for estimating the Market Value of buildings and plant and machinery. 
3. Discounted Cash Flow 
Method 
This method is based on the present value of the future receivable net 
income from the current operational leases / revenues. The current 
revenues and the future achievable revenues derived from the operational 
project components of the Project Site would be adjusted for the outgoing 
expenses to derive 10 -year cash flows. The same is then discounted at 
an appropriate discounting rate linked with risk adjusted discounting factor 
to estimate the market value for the operational project components. This 
method is sometimes referred to as ‘Rent Roll method as well. 
 
Approach and Methodology Adopted for Estimating Market Value of the Project 
 
Based on a detailed review of the leases for the Project, the Valuer has noted that a large number of leases of the 
Project were executed at rent prevalent at the time of signing of such leases or at a discount to prevailing market 
rental (for a few anchor  tenants). Since the real estate industry is dynamic and is influenced by various factors 
(such as existing supply, demand-supply dynamics, quality of spaces, overall health of the economy, existing rent, 
future growth plans, etc.) at a particular point in  time, negotiated rent may tend to move away from the prevalent 
market rent over a period of time. It has also been witnessed that the market rent for some properties or submarkets 
increase or decrease at a rate significantly different from those agreed to in initial leases. These factors reinforce 
the need to review each of these leases in isolation to estimate the intrinsic value of the property under review. 
 
Considering the objective of this exercise and the nature of asset involved the following valuation approaches and 
methods have been adopted:  
A) Completed & operational space: IVS2025 suggests use of Income Approach for valuing assets that 
possess revenue generation potential. Given that these spaces are generating revenue through lease 
and other related income sources, value of these spaces is contingent on their revenue generation 
potential. Valuer has, therefore, adopted Income Approach for opining on market value of this asset. 
Under this approach, Valuer has adopted the Discounted Cash Flow method of valuation entailing term 
+ rent reversion as it allows for capture of revenue generation over full term period of leases of these 
spaces and when they revert to market rents at those points of time when their respective leases

SUMMARY VALUATION REPORT
expire. Valuer has not considered Market Approach while opining on market value of these assets as 
these are not homogenous in nature (in the sense that there are no similar and/or comparable large-
scale projects/spaces that have been either sold or are available for purchase in their micro-market. 
Further, Cost Approach is typically considered for unique and special asset classes, such as industrial, 
where their value may not be the sum of their individual components. In addition, IVS2025 also states 
that Cost Approach should be adopted if there is no information that allows for adoption of Income 
Approach and/or Market Approach. Since this is not the case with these completed and operational 
spaces, Valuer has not considered the Cost Approach as well.   
B) Under construction and Future development projects: IVS2025 suggests use of Income Approach 
for valuing assets that possess revenue generation potential. Given that these projects will be 
generating revenue once completed through lease and other related income sources, value of these 
spaces is contingent on their future revenue generation potential. Valuer has, therefore, adopted 
Income Approach for opining on market value of these projects. Under this approach, Valuer has 
adopted the Discounted Cash Flow method of valuation as it allows for capture of revenue generation 
over the full development and explicit cash flow period for their spaces. Under this method, Valuer has 
considered cash outflows entailed in development of the project(s) till the time they become complete 
and become revenue-generating, for which Valuer has assumed spaces within these project(s) will be 
leased at market rents at that point of time. Subsequently, terminal value has been estimated in the 10th 
year using 11th-year NOI, and all cash flows have been discounted to the valuation date to estimate the 
market value of the project(s). Valuer has not considered Market Approach while opining on market 
value of these assets as these under-construction and future development projects are not 
homogenous in nature (in the sense that there are no similar and/or comparable large-scale 
projects/spaces that have been either sold or are available for purchase in their micro-market with 
development approvals and/or partial construction). Further, Cost Approach is typically considered for 
unique and special asset classes, such as industrial, where their value may not be the sum of their 
individual components. In addition, IVS2025 also states that Cost Approach should be adopted if there 
is no information that allows for adoption of Income Approach and/or Market Approach. Since this is not 
the case with these completed and operational spaces, Valuer has not considered the Cost Approach 
as well.  
C) Partially Developed Project but not leased (only for Pocharam, Hyderabad): Given the nature of 
this asset, and current real estate market dynamics for commercial and IT/ITeS sector at the subject 
property micro-market level, it is evident that this Subject Property does not have revenue generation 
potential. Consequently, Income Approach has not been considered.  Further, given that Subject 
Property comprises of land, built components, and plant and machinery, the Subject Property, as a 
unit, is not homogeneous in nature and is unlikely to be traded on a unit basis, as comparable 
instances of similarly partially-developed real estate properties of a similar scale and with the same 
permitted use are not available in the Subject Property micro-market. Consequently, Market Approach 
has also not been adopted. Further, given that Subject Property, in its current form and status, is 
comprised of individual components, opinion on market value of each of which can be estimated 
independently, Valuer has adopted the Cost Approach which allows its value estimation as a sum of 
their individual components. In addition, IVS2025 also states that Cost Approach should be adopted if 
there is no information that allows for adoption of Income Approach and/or Market Approach. Since this 
is the case with this Subject Property, Valuer has considered the Physical Method (also known as Land 
and Building Method) under Cost Approach while opining on market value of this Subject Proeprty. 
 
2.4 ADOPTED PROCEDURE 
 
The market practice in most commercial/ office developments involves contracting tenants / 
occupiers in the form of pre-commitments at sub-market rent to increase attractiveness of the 
property to prospective tenants - typically extended to anchor tenants. Additionally, there are 
instances of tenants paying above-market rent for certain properties as well (primarily owing 
to market conditions at the time of contracting the lease). In order to arrive at a unit value for 
these tenancies, the Valuer has considered the impact of such sub/above market rents on the 
valuation of the Project.

Half-yearly Report 2025-26
 
For the purpose of this valuation exercise, the Valuer has analyzed the tenancy details 
provided by the Client, to identify variances vis -à-vis prevailing market/marginal rent. Each 
lease is assessed separately for below aspects, for the rent over a 10-year time horizon: 
• The rent rolls (and the corresponding lease deeds on a sample basis) were reviewed to 
identify tenancy characteristics for the asset. As part of the rent roll review, major 
tenancy agreements belonging to top tenants were reviewed on a sample basis.  
• Title certificates, architect certificates and other related documents as mentioned in 
relevant sections of the report were reviewed for validation of area details, ownership 
interests of the Project.  
• Physical site inspections were undertaken to assess the status of the Project. 
 
Cash Flow Projections 
The cash flows for the Project has been projected separately for each lease, to arrive at their 
respective value estimates.  
 
Net Operating Income (NOI) has primarily been used to arrive at the value of the Project. The 
projected future cash flows from the Project are based on existing lease terms for the 
operational leases till the expiry of the leases or re-negotiation, whichever is earlier, following 
which, the lease terms have been aligned with market rents achievable by the Project.  
 
For vacant area and under-construction/future development area, the achievable market rent-
led cash flows are projected factoring appropriate lease -up timeframe for vacant/under -
construction/future development area. These cash flows have been projected for  10-year 
duration from the date of valuation and for 11th year (for estimate of terminal value based on 
NOI). These future cash flows are then discounted to present-day value (valuation date) at an 
appropriate discount rate. Each lease is assessed separately for below aspects, for the rent 
over a 10-year time horizon. 
• Projecting the rental income for identified tenancies up to the period of lease expiry, 
lock-in expiry, escalation milestones, etc. whichever is applicable. In the event of 
unleased spaces, market-led rent is adopted with suitable lease-up time.  
• Generating a market led rental income stream for identified tenancies for the time period 
similar to the cash flows drawn in the aforementioned step.  
• Computing the monthly income based on rent projected above and translating the same 
to quarterly income (for the next 10 years and 11th year is considered for calculation of 
terminal value). 
 
Further, to arrive at the total value of the leased spaces (from base rentals), appropriate 
revenues and operational expenses are projected on quarterly basis. Some of such 
adjustments on revenue and operational expenses are presented in the table below: 
 
Table 2.2: Key Market Assumptions 
Parameters Description / Basis 
Capitalization 
Rate 
The capitalization rate adopted for valuing the assets has been based on various factors such 
as: 
• Historical entry yields (going in cap rates) for commercial / office asset 
transactions across various key markets in India, which have steadily shown a 
downward trend over last  from 10.5% - 11.5% to about 7.5% - 8.5%. These cap 
rates have been specified in the table below. The cap rates have been stable 
around these levels in the recent past. 
• The increased appetite for income generating assets and availability of various 
modes of finance (real estate credit flows) backing such acquisitions. 
• The demand supply situation in the respective city and expected dynamics of 
demand leading supply - given entry challenges such as land availability, higher 
initial cost outlays etc. developers are expected to focus on fully built to suit or 
semi-speculative projects (with key tenants tied in prior to launch of construction).

Parameters Description / Basis 
• Inflation (and interest rates) expected to be maintained in check with 
interventions from the Reserve Bank of India, in case of significant change. 
Valuer has considered specific transactions of commercial real estate assets in India in below 
table. Valuer has estimated capitalization rate from cap rates for sale transactions  for 
comparable assets of similar risk profile to determine capitalization rate for the project. Cap 
rates also factors in investor expectations for comparable assets of similar risk profile. 
 
Valuer has estimated capitalization rate from cap rates for sale transactions for comparable 
assets of similar risk profile to determine capitalization rate for the project. Cap rates also factors 
in investor expectations for comparable assets of similar risk profile. The valuer has considered 
specific attributes and nuances of the Subject Project s
, wherein it is observed to possess 
significant advantages over other office spaces in its micro-market. In addition, it being a single-
owner asset (which results in quicker decision-making and more attractive for the broader pool 
of investors as it also reduces complications related to negotiation between multiple parties). 
Although historically the cap rates have compressed in India, the Valuer does not have any data 
to forecast the cap rate compression post 10 years. Hence, the Valuer has kept terminal 
capitalization rate to be 8.0% for which is similar to that prevailing for most of the transactions 
today. The said cap rate has been applied on the 1 year forward net operating income after 10 
years and is utilized for the purpose of calculation of exit value / terminal cash flow
. The 
capitalization rate of 8% has been applied for all assets of Mindspace REIT’s portfolio except for 
The Square BKC. 
 
The Square BKC is a CBD asset situated in India’s most premium micro -market – Bandra 
Kurla Complex (BKC) that is characterized by limited land supply, the presence of high-profile 
corporate front offices, and low vacancy levels.    Assets located in CBD enjoy investor 
preference as they have lower risk of vacancy and hence command a lower cap rate.  
 
Given the premium nature of the micro -market the valuer has applied a premium, resulting 
in a lower cap rate of 7.75% for The Square BKC.

WACC Completed Assets  
 
Discount rate 
This discount rate, applied to discount the available cash flows, reflects the cost of equity (the 
opportunity cost for shareholders) and the cost of debt (the opportunity cost for creditors), with 
each cost weighted according to its proportion in the entity’s overall capital structure (“WACC”). 
 
Cost of Debt 
The cost of debt represents the return an entity must offer its lenders as compensation for the 
risk involved in providing capital. In real estate, this cost varies depending on the development 
stage of the asset. Properties that are fully developed and ge
nerating stable income are 
generally viewed as lower risk, resulting in more favorable (i.e., lower) interest rates. For 
completed assets of Mindspace Business Parks REIT, the cost of debt is estimated taking into 
consideration the prevailing cost of borro wings as well as cost of borrowings of Mindspace 
Business Parks REIT and / or its SPVs over the period of last eight years. The period of eight 
years has been considered taking into account 3-4 years prior to the Covid and 3-4 years post 
the pandemic. The said period also normalizes the aberrations in rates due to interest rate 
cycles. This approach ensures that the cost of debt is aligned with the risk profile of the property 
and current market conditions. Average cost of borrowing during this period was a round 8.5%. 
Following the recent decline in interest rates, the cost of new debt capital has reduced. However, 
the REIT has a portion of its debt portfolio locked in at fixed rates for the long term, which remains 
unaffected by current market movements. For valuation purposes of the completed portion, we 
have considered a cost of debt at 8.3%, which reflects a blend of the historical average borrowing 
cost and the prevailing interest rates.  
 
Cost of Equity  
Based on discussion with investors and market participants, by capital markets team of JLL, a 
leading international property consultant who have frequent and continuing discussions with 
financial institutions and market participants, particularly investors  in and investees in projects 
similar to those in Mindspace REIT, the valuer has observed that for REITs, the market return 
expectations consists of yield of 6% -7% and an annual capital appreciation of 6% -
7% for 
completed assets. Valuer has, therefore, est imated the cost of equity of ~13.5% taking into 
consideration these investor expectations. The same has been validated via capital asset pricing 
model (“CAPM”) also.  
The inputs considered for the CAPM are as illustrated below, 
• We have considered risk free rate of 6.89% based on average 10-year treasury bond yield 
• Average annual market returns of 11.96% based on the returns of NIFTY 50 index over the 
past 10 years (equity risk premium of 5.07%) 
• Beta of 1.45 has been calculated using constituents of NIFTY Realty Index as well as four listed 
REITs which have been benchmarked against NIFTY 50 
 
CAPM is a financial model used to calculate the expected return of an asset or investment, 
considering risk and market conditions. Market expectations, on the other hand, refer to the 
collective beliefs and anticipations of market participants regarding fu ture economic conditions 
and asset prices. While CAPM provides a theoretical framework for estimating returns, market

Parameters Description / Basis 
expectations are the actual, subjective beliefs that influence investment decisio ns and market 
behaviour. While CAPM can be a useful tool, it is crucial to consider market expectations when 
making investment decisions, as these can deviate from the theoretical predictions of the model 
and may not be able to capture various nuances of the market which the market participants are 
constantly exposed to and aware of while deciding on their return expectations. Valuer has, 
consequently, considered market expectations of cost of equity. 
 
Debt to Equity ratio 
The SEBI REIT regulations allow for maximum permissible limit of debt as 49%. The existing 
debt to equity mix of Mindspace Business Parks REIT as on June 30, 2025 stood at 25.0% : 
75.0%. Considering the management’s guidance on desirable leverage levels fo r Mindspace 
REIT, we have considered the debt and equity mix of 35% and 65% which falls well within the 
limit specified above and is also accepted by the market participants and rating agencies.

the pandemic. The said period also NORMALIZES the aberrations in rates due to interest rate 
cycles. This approach ensures that the cost of debt is aligned with the risk profile of the property 
and current market conditions. Average cost of borrowing during this period was around 8.5%. 
Following the recent decline in interest rates, the cost of new debt capital has reduced. However, 
the REIT has a portion of its debt portfolio locked in at fixed rates for the long term, which remains 
unaffected by current market movements. For valuation purposes of the completed portion, we 
have considered a cost of debt at 8.3%, which reflects a blend of the historical average borrowing 
cost and the prevailing interest rates. For under construction and future development projects, 
a premium of 75 bps has been considered which broadly reflects the differential in costs of 
borrowings between LRDs and construction finance reflecting the development risks involved. 
Hence, the cost of debt for under-construction projects has been considered at 9.0%. 
 
Cost of Equity  
Under construction / future development projects involve a significantly higher risk as compared 
to the completed projects due to development risk, approval and leasing risks involved. Investors 
taking exposure to such projects have a typical return expectation ranging between 18% -20%,

The SEBI REIT regulations allow for maximum permissible limit of debt as 49%. The existing 
debt to equity mix of Mindspace Business Parks REIT as on June 30, 2025 stood at 25.0% : 
75.0%. Considering the management’s guidance on desirable leverage levels fo r Mindspace 
REIT, we have considered the debt and equity mix of 35% and 65% which falls well within the 
limit specified above and is also accepted by the market participants and rating agencies.

Debt 9.0% 35% 
Equity 19.0% 65% 
Total ~ 15.50% 
 
Considering the project completion period and the forecast period of 10 years, the discount rate 
has been estimated considering discount rate expectations during the construction phase and 
the phase post completion of the project.  
Based on this approach, the derived average discount rate for development projects is 
estimated to be 13.0% and used for discounting the cashflow during the forecast period.

Based on the site inspection, the Project has two buildings and ~ 19 acre of land for 
future development. 
 
Subject Property has undergone significant changes over the last six months with 
the existing tenant(s) having moved out of the property.  Both leasable buildings in 
the Subject Property are currently vacant and considerable challenges have been 
observed over these last six months in leasing this Subject Property. Further, recent 
market feedback indicates that Subject Property micro -market is no longer being 
considered as an active destination for IT/ITeS spaces. The IT/ITeS activity in the 
city has been la
rgely concentrated in the western quadrant and there is no 
immediate visibility of demand in the eastern quadrant. Given these constraints, the 
approach to valuation of Subject Property has been changed, in line with guidance 
provided under International Valuation Standards 202 5, to Cost Approach from 
Income Approach considered previously, as there is currently no direct evidence of 
rent and no other identifiable income streams and does not appear likely in the near 
foreseeable future from the Subject Property. The land component has been valued 
while considering the Comparable Sales Method (under the Market Approach), and 
built component and plant and machinery component s have 
been valued 
considering the Depreciated Replacement Cost Method.

SUMMARY VALUATION REPORT
Freehold / Leasehold The underlying land of the Project Site is held as leasehold from MIDC, which 
lease is valid for a term of 99 years from 1st August, 1964. Further, the 
company has right to renew the lease for a period of 99 years upon the terms 
and conditions therein. Given that the purpose and obligations associated 
with lease of the underlying land has essentially been achieved, the 
likelihood of lease getting cancelled or not renewed at the end of the tenure 
is negligible. Thus, no specific adjustments are required to be made towards 
the legal tenure of underlying land’s ownership.

4.7.5 P OWER DISTRIBUTION SERVICES 
 
In accordance with Section 14 (b) of the Electricity Act, 2003 read with Section 4(1) of the SEZ 
Act, 2005, entities that own and operate SEZ Parks are considered Deemed Distribution 
Licensee for supplying electricity to consumers within the SEZ area. Purs uant to the above 
regulations, MBPPL also has the license to distribute power within the Subject Property.  
 
The SPV has invested in the infrastructure to facilitate the distribution of the power to the 
customers (occupiers and operators within the subject properties). It procures power from 
Power generators supplying to the grid and then distribute it to the end consumers within the 
Project Site. The SPV is not allowed to expand the power distribution outside the limits of the 
SEZ, i.e., the Project Site in this case. 
 
4.7.6 A DOPTED METHODOLOGY FOR POWER DISTRIBUTION SERVICES 
 
Referring to the commission’s latest order for the operational facility, the cash flows from the 
power distribution services are projected in the following manner:  
 
• Amount of approved Gross Fixed Assets (“GFA”) is considered  
• Further, Net Fixed Asset (NFA) which is GFA reduced by accumulated depreciation 
allowed as on date is computed.  
412
412
Half-yearly Report 2025-26
• To compute the Net Cashflows, mainly return on equity, interest on notational debt, 
recovery of depreciation, interest on working capital have been added.  
• Licensee is allowed to charge 14% return on equity which is 30% of GFA. In case of no 
actual loan, the commission allows a return on normative loan equal to 70% of GFA 
based on MYT regulations 2019. SLM (Straight Line Method) is considered for 
depreciation, as per the average rate approved by the commission. Depreciation is 
considered to the extent of 90% of the GFA.  
• Approved power procurement, operational and maintenance expenses are allowed 
completely pass through.

SEZ, i.e., the Project Site in this case. 
 
4.8.6 A DOPTED METHODOLOGY FOR POWER DISTRIBUTION SERVICES 
 
Referring to the commission’s latest order for the operational facility, the cash flows from the 
power distribution services are projected in the following manner:  
 
• Amount of approved Gross Fixed Assets (“GFA”) is considered  
• Further, Net Fixed Asset (NFA) which is GFA reduced by accumulated depreciation 
allowed as on date is computed.  
• To compute the Net Cashflows, mainly return on equity, interest on notational debt, 
recovery of depreciation, interest on working capital have been added.  
• Licensee is allowed to charge 14% return on equity which is 30% of GFA. In case of no 
actual loan, the commission allows a return on normative loan equal to 70% of GFA based 
on MYT regulations 2019. SLM (Straight Line Method) is considered for depreciation , as 
per the average rate approved by the commission. Depreciation is considered to the extent 
of 90% of the GFA.  
• Approved power procurement, operational and maintenance expenses are allowed 
completely pass through.

4.12.5 POWER DISTRIBUTION SERVICES 
 
In accordance with Section 14 (b) of the Electricity Act, 2003 read with Section 4(1) of the SEZ 
Act, 2005, entities that own and operate SEZ Parks are considered Deemed Distribution 
Licensee for supplying electricity to consumers within the SEZ area. Purs uant to the above 
regulations, KRC Infrastructure and Projects Private Limited also has the license to distribute 
power within the Project Site.  
 
The SPV has invested in the infrastructure to facilitate the distribution of the power to the 
customers (occupiers and operators within the subject properties). It procures power from 
Power generators supplying to the grid and then distribute it to the end consumers within the 
Project Site . The SPV is not allowed to expand the power distribution outside the limits of the 
SEZ, i.e., the Project Site in this case. 
 
4.12.6 ADOPTED METHODOLOGY FOR POWER DISTRIBUTION SERVICES 
 
Referring to the commission’s latest order for the operational facility, the cash flows from the 
power distribution services are projected in the following manner:  
 
Amount of approved Gross Fixed Assets (“GFA”) is considered. 
 
Further, Net Fixed Asset (NFA) which is GFA reduced by accumulated depreciation allowed 
as on date is computed.  
 
To compute the Net Cashflows, mainly return on equity, interest on notational debt, recovery 
of depreciation, interest on working capital have been added.  
 
• Licensee is allowed to charge 14% return on equity which is 30% of GFA. In case of no 
actual loan, the commission allows a return on normative loan equal to 70% of GFA based 
on MYT regulations 2019. SLM (Straight Line Method) is considered for depreciation , as 
437

SUMMARY VALUATION REPORT
 
 
per the average rate approved by the commission. Depreciation is considered to the extent 
of 90% of the GFA.  
• Approved power procurement, operational and maintenance expenses are allowed 
completely pass through.

4.12.8 F ACILITIES MANAGEMENT SERVICES 
 
KRC Infrastructure and Projects Private Limited has commenced facility management 
business effective October 1, 2020 to provide such services to the Subject Properties within 
the portfolio as well as properties with ownership interests of/owned by third parties within the 
same parks as the Subject Properties of the Portfolio (as mentioned in the following table). 
Facility management services include housekeeping services, management of MEP 
equipment, façade cleaning, security expenses, repair and maintenance, maintenance of 
common areas etc. Service charges are levied on a cost -plus mark-up basis to the SPVs 
owned by REIT, which has ownership interest in the Subject Properties. 
 
The facilities management services business shall operate under the brand name CAMPLUS 
and shall manage the existing operational buildings / area in the Portfolio. In addition, area 
under-construction/ future development shall also be managed by KRC Infras tructure and 
Projects Private Limited on completion.

Existing Operational 
Building which will be 
under facility management 
(including sold units and 
landowner areas) 
Existing Operational 
Building which will be 
under facility 
management  
Total area of ~ 30.2 
million sq ft. as at ( 30 
September 2025) Mix 
of SEZ and non SEZ 
building.  
The revenue of facility 
management is linked to 
the expense for such facility 
plus mark up, the growth in 
the revenues from existing 
tenants are in line with the 
inflation expectation of 5%.  
Expansion in Existing 
business and Buildings 
under construction  
(including landowner 
areas) 
Expansion in Existing 
business and Buildings 
under construction 
Total area of ~ 7.2 
million sq ft. 
For future development/  
proposed buildings, 
revenue and margins of 
existing properties is 
considered as a base to 
compute the projected cash 
flows of new buildings. 
Growth in revenue is linked 
to the improvement in 
occupancy plus 5% 
revenue growth from 
existing tenants. Initially  
438
438
Half-yearly Report 2025-26
 
those buildings are likely to 
have lower margins due to 
lesser occupancy.  
 
For the purpose of arriving at terminal year income multiple, Indian and International 
comparable companies listed on various stock exchanges were studied. It was observed that 
International companies with primary business of facility/property management t rade at 10 - 
13 times EV/EBITDA multiple. However, there are very limited comparable facility 
management listed companies. There is only listed comparable company, which offers facility 
management services in India including security services, cash logistic etc. Given the fact that 
facility/property management business is limited to Subject Properties within the portfolio as 
well as properties with ownership interests of/owned by third parties within the same parks as 
the Subject Properties of the portfolio, we have considered the EV/EBITDA multiple of 13x to 
compute the exit value post 10 years of cashflows. For the purpose of discounting the future 
cash flows, a Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of 11.75% has been used.
