2. The Company's Management is responsible for the preparation of the Statement in
accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian
Accounting Standard 34, (lnd AS 34) "lnterim Financial Reporting' prescribed under
Section 133 of the Companies AcL 2013 as amended, read with relevant rules issued
thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in lndia and in
compliance with Regulation 33 and 52 of the Listing Regulations. The Statement has
been approved by the Company's Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to express a
conclusion on the Statement based on our review.
J. We conducted our review ofthe Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review
Engagements (SRE) 2410, "Review of lnterim Financial lnformation Performed by the
lndependent Auditor ofthe Entity" issued by the lnstitute ofChartered Accountants of
lndia. This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain limited
assurance as to whether the Statement is fiee of material misstatement- A review of
interim financial infbrmation consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analyical and other
review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain
assurance that we would become aware ofall significant matters that might be identified
in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an
audit opinion
