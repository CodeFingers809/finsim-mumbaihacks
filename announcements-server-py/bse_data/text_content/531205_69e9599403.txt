Political slugfest in Bengal over Trinamool leader Kalyan
Banerjee’s remarks linking PM Modi with Delhi blast
Kolkata,  A political
slugfest has surfaced in West
Bengal on Saturday over a
controversial statement made
by f our -time T rinamool
Congress Lok Sabha member
and senior advocate of
Calcutta High Court, Kalyan
Banerjee, during the day
linking Prime Minister
Narendra Modi in connection
with the car explosion in New
Delhi earlier this week, killing
12 persons.
While speaking to the
media persons, Banerjee said
that the blast was conducted
deliberately just a day before
the second phase of the Bihar
Assembly polls, just to create
a sympathy wave in favour of
the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP).
The car explosion took
place near Red Fort Metro
Station in Delhi on the evening
of November 10, and on
November 11, the second
phase of the two-phase Bihar
polls took place.
On Frida y, after the
announcement of the Bihar
Assembly poll results, where
the BJP-led National
Democratic Alliance (NDA)
established a landslide victory,
the Prime Minister said that the
Bihar results have paved the
way for the BJP's victory in
West Bengal for the 2026 state
Assembly polls.
"I would like to assure the
people of West Bengal that
"Jungle Raj" will end in West
Bengal in 2026," the Prime
Minister said on Friday.
Reacting to the Prime
Minister's comments
regarding the 2026 West
Bengal Assembly polls, Kalyan
Banerjee said on Saturday that
the Delhi car explosion was
conducted deliberately just a
day before the second phase
of the Bihar Assembly polls,
just to create a sympathy
wave in favour of the BJP, and
also held the Prime Minister
responsible for masterminding
that conspiracy.
"The Prime Minister has
destroyed the democratic
ambience in India. Hundreds
of people are dying in the
country . He had won b y
planting bombs in the car near
the Red Fort Metro station the
night before the second phase
of the Bihar election. The
'jungle raj' has been
established in the country by
the Prime Minister himsel f.
When you were the Chief
Minister in Gujarat, you were
killing people. You established
jungle raj in Madhya Pradesh
and Delhi. On the contrary, the
people of West Bengal are at
peace. The people of West
Bengal gave a fitting reply to
the BJP in 2021. They will give
a befitting reply to the BJP
again in 2026," Banerjee
added.
Scribe-turned-politician
and BJP's state General
Secretary Jagannath
Chattopadhyay said that a
competition is going on
between Kalyan Banerjee and
a state spokesman of
Trinamool Congress on who is
more capable of pronouncing
slurs at the Prime Minister of
the country.
"The more they use such
slurs, the more popularity the
BJP will gain in West Bengal.
Our Prime Minister is in the
hearts of common people,"
Chattopadhyay added.

readiness in Rajasthan’s Thar desert
Jaipur, The Ranbankura
Division of the Indian Army's
Sapta Shakti Command, on
Satur day, conducted an
extensive validation exercise
in Rajasthan's Thar Desert at
the Mahajan Field Firing

Command Army Commander,
reviewed the proceedings of
the exercise aimed to refine
tactical procedures, enhance
inter-arms coordination and
test the seamless integration
of all entities and detachments
under challenging
environment and terrain
conditions. The exercise
tested the troops' endurance,
discipline and ability to
perform in a realistic high-
intensity battlefield
environment. The exercise
focused on ensuring that

comprising of inf antry ,
mechanised forces, air
defence, artillery fire support,

networks, aptly demonstrating
the division's high state of
preparedness and its ability to
respond to evolving threats.
By simulating a fluid and
contested battle scenario, the
exercise tested every level of
command in decision-making,
adaptability and rapid
response capabilities. The
formation displayed
outstanding professionalism
and teamwork in executing
swift, synchronised and
coordinated manoeuvres to
meet complex operational
challenges. The Army
Commander Lieutenant

the participating troops for
their professionalism,
innovation and mission focus.
Their performance reflected
the ethos of Indian Army
commitment.
‘Global leader’ PM Modi held in
high regard for championing
issues of Global South: SA envoy
New Delhi,  As Prime
Minister Narendra Modi heads
to South Africa next week to
attend the Group of 20 (G20)
Leaders' Summit in
Johannesburg, the country's
envoy in New Delhi on
Saturday hailed the continuous
efforts and contributions
made by the Indian PM to fulfill
the collective aspirations of the
Global South.Millennial media
consulting
"It's a given fact that Prime
Minister Modi is highly
respected globally within the
African continent. He is held
in high regard in South Africa
and we see him as an
important global leader who
is championing issues of the
Global South, including Africa.
This will be Prime Minister
Modi's fourth visit to South
Africa in less than a decade. I
think he's one of the Indian
Prime Ministers that has gone
to South Africa the most
number of times. And, that's
also true of his numerous
visits to the African continent
and including of President
Droupadi Murmu who has
visited several African
countries since she assumed
office. This signifies the
importance that India places
on its relationship with the
African continent, including
South Africa," Anil Sooklal, the
High Commissioner of South
Africa to India, revealed to
IANS in an exclusive chat on
Saturday.
India, under PM Modi,
spearheaded efforts that led
to the African Union joining the
G20 - an achievement termed
as a landmark during India's
G20 presidency in 2023.
"We must recall that it was
through his efforts, and that
of the Indian government, who
championed the inclusion of
the African Union into the G20
as a full member during
India's presidency in 2023.
And, I think the African
continent leaders have spoken
very favourably of the role that
India and especially Prime
Minister Modi played in
ensuring that the AU is now a
full member," said Sooklal.
The G20 Leaders' Summit
is set to take place on
November 22 and 23 in
Johannesburg, South Africa's
largest city and economic hub.
South African President
Cyril Ramaphosa and Prime
Minister Modi will also hold an
important bilateral meeting on
the sidelines of the event
where they are likely to not
only reflect on the status of the
current bilateral relationship
but also look at new areas of
cooperation in areas like
security cooperation, people-
to-people contact, etc.
"India was one of the first
countries to support our
struggle against apartheid and
to support our liberation
struggle. Since we became a
democracy in 1994, our
relationship has grown
significantly. India is our third
largest trading partner, one of
our most important global
partners. We have a very
deep foundation that
underpins our relationship.
The cooperation we have
within the multilateral domain,
within terms of bilateral trade,
is very vibrant, it continues to
grow.
"And, I am sure when
Prime Minister Modi and
President Ramaphosa meet
next week for bilateral
meeting, which they will have,
they will reflect on the status
of the relationship and also we
look at new areas of
cooperation in deepening this
very important relationship in
areas like security
cooperation, in areas like
people to people contact. And
also, in terms of trade and
investment, cultural
cooperation, as you know,
sports and culture is a major
pillar of our cooperation in
terms of cementing ties
between our respective
countries," Sooklal told IANS.
Ahead of PM Modi's visit,
the African media is
highlighting how two years
ago, during India's Presidency
at the G20 Summit in New
Delhi, Prime Minister Modi
formally announced the
African Union's inclusion as a
permanent member of the
group.
"This was a seismic
announcement, allowing the
AU the ability to give Africa a
unified voice in global
economic governance,
promote equitable
representation, and advance
the continent's interests in
areas like trade, climate
change, and development.
The genesis of the AU joining
the G20 actually started seven
years ago, when Modi
unveiled India’s 10 'guiding
principles' for ties with African
countries during a speech in
the Ugandan parliament," a
report in South African media
outlet IOL detailed.

Delhi CM Rekha Gupta unveils online
fire safety certificate renewal portal
New Delhi,  Delhi Chief
Minister Rekha Gupta on
Saturday launched a
dedicated portal enabling the
complete online renewal of
Fire Safety Certificates.
Calling the initiative an
important milestone in
advancing transparent and
technology-driven
governance, the Chief Minister
said it would greatly
strengthen the ‘Ease of Doing
Business’ environment in the
national capital.
The Chief Minister
inaugurated the Portal for
Online Renewal of Fire Safety
Certificate at the Delhi
Secretariat in the presence of
Delhi’s Home and Education
Minister, Ashish S ood, and
senior officials of the Delhi Fire
Service (DFS). Developed
jointly by the National
Informatics Centre (NIC) and
the Delhi Government, the
portal modernises and
streamlines the fire safety
renewal process in a
fundamental w ay, said an
official statement.
The Chief Minister noted
that over the past eight
months, the Delhi government
has introduced several historic
reforms benefitting traders,
citizens, and institutions across
the city.
Processes relating to fire
permits, licensing, and other
statutory approvals have been
simplified, made more
transparent, and integrated
through a single-window
mechanism, she said.
Earlier, multiple agencies
were involved, resulting in
procedural delays and
inconvenience. Clear
departmental accountability
has now been established,
and responsibility for issuing
the final certificate rests with
the designated authority.
She further emphasised
that to ensure maximum
transparency, departmental
file-processing has been made
fully digital.
Citizens can now track the
real-time status of their
applications, including the
officer handling the file,
pendency duration, and stage
of scrutiny.
Calling the new renewal
portal a major administrative
reform, the Chief Minister said
Prime Minister Narendra
Modi’s vision of 'Digital India'
is elevating governance
across the nation.
In alignment with that
vision, the Delhi government
remains committed to
delivering a ‘Digital Delhi’
where services are faceless,
transparent, and technology-
driven.
Highlighting the ease of
digital adoption even among
small vendors and rickshaw
pullers, she said the
governance system must
evolve at the same pace to
remain citizen-friendly and
modern. CM Gupta reaffirmed
that citizen safety, simplified
services, and transparent
administration remain the
government’s highest
priorities. Speaking on the
occasion, Delhi’s Home
Minister Ashish Sood said that
under the leadership of PM
Modi, the nation is progressing
with the guiding principle of
“Minimum Government,
Maximum Governance.”
The objective is to make
governance simpler , mor e
efficient, and empowering for
citizens.
