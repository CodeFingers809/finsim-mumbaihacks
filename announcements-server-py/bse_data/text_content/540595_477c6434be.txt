Summary P&L
Select Balance Sheet Items
▪ Working capital started to taper off in H1FY26; build-up 
mainly on account of: 
▪ Receivables (mainly for BSNL 4G project offset by 
advance received)
▪ Inventory procurement for anticipated projects 
▪ Partly offset by lower payables
▪ Increase in borrowings mainly to fund working capital 
requirements and capex
(1) EBIT = PBT – Other Income + Finance Cost including Net forex loss 
(2) Net working capital calculated as Current Assets (excluding Cash & Cash Equivalents) net of Current Liabilities (excluding Borrowings and lease liabilities) 
(3) Cash and cash equivalents includes investment in liquid mutual funds, deposits, other Bank balances 
▪ Revenue increased by ~9x between FY23 and FY25 
mainly due to large project execution (BSNL 4G, BSNL 
MAAN)
▪ H1FY26 profitability impacted due to 
▪ Delay in receipt of select large orders
▪ Inventory and warranty related provisions
