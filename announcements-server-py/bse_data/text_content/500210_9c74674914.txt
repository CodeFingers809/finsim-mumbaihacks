INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REVIEW REPORT ON REVIEW OF INTERIM FINANCIAL RESULTS
  
TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF INGERSOLL-RAND (INDIA) LIMITED 
 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Unaudited Financial Results of Ingersoll-
Rand (India) Limited (“the Company”) for the quarter and half year ended  September 30, 
2025 (“the Statement”), being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirement of 
Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, 
as amended (“the Listing Regulations”).   
 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company’s Management and approved by the 
Company’s Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standard 34 “Interi m Financial 
Reporting” (“Ind AS 34”), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with 
relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and 
in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulat ions. Our responsibility is to express a 
conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 ‘Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity’, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
(ICAI). A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of the 
Company’s personnel responsible for financial and accounting matters and applying analytical 
and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in s cope than an audit conducted in 
accordance with Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 
2013 and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of 
all significant matters that might be ide ntified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an 
audit opinion.   
 
4. Based on our review conducted as stated in paragraph 3 above, nothing has come to our 
attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance 
with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Ind ian Accounting 
Standard and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the 
information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended, including the manner in which it 
is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
