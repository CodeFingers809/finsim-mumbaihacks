The Board of Directors

1. We have reviewed the unaudited financial results ofStovec Industries Limited (the "Company") for 
the quarter ended September 30, 2025 and the year to date results for the period January 0 1, 2025 
to September 30, :.!025, which are included in the accompnnying Statement of unaudited financial 
resu lts for the quarter and nine mon ths ended September 30, 2025 (the "Statement"). The 
Statement has been prepared by the Company pursuant to Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and DL~closure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (the "Listing 
Regulations, 2015"), which has been digitally signed by us for identification purposes . 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and approved by the 
Board of Directors, has been prepared in accorda nce with the recognition and meas urement 
principle s laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 "In terim Financia l Repor ting" ("lnd AS 
3tJ"), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies i\ct, 2013, and other accounting principles 
gcnera l_ly accepted in Tndia. Our responsibil ity is to express a conclusion on the Stateme nt based on 
our reVIew. 
3- We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financia llnfom1ation Perfonned by the Independen t 
Auditor of the Entity", issued by the Institute of Chmtercd Accountant s of India. This Standard 
requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the 
Statement is free of materia l misstatement. A review of intetim financia l information consists of 
making inquiries , primari ly of person s respons ible for financial and accounting matters, and 
app lying ana lytical and other re\~ew procedures . i\ review is substan tially less in scope than an 
audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequ~ntly docs not enab le us to 
obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in 
an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinioJ1. 
4- Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe 
that the Statement has not been prepa red in all materia l respects in accordance with the recognition 
and measurement princip les laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standard and other 
accounting principles genera lly accepted in India nnd has not disclosed the information required to 
be disclosed in tem1s of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations, 2015 including the manner in 
which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
