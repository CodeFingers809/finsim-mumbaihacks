Dear Sir, 
 
Sub: Disclosure under Regulation 30 read with Clau se 8 of Para B of Part A of Schedule III 
of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Di sclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 – 
Update on ongoing litigations 
 
We refer to the disclosure made by the Company on August 14, 2023 and update on ongoing Tax 
Litigations or Disputes filed through Integrat ed Governance Reports from time to time. In 
furtherance thereof, we inform you that with regard to Sr.No. 8 of the Annexure 1 referred to in the 
aforesaid disclosure in respect of the Service Tax demand of Rs.22.57 Crores including mandatory 
and other penalties, the Service Tax Rectification of Mistake Application filed by the Company for 
recalling the original order passed by the Cust oms, Excise & Service Tax Appellate Tribunal 
(CESTAT) on January 10, 2025 has been rejected by the Principal Bench of CESTAT, New Delhi 
vide its order dated November 18, 2025. The Company has sighted the aforesaid order on CESTAT 
website yesterday evening. 
 
The Company is in process of filing statutory appeal against the said orders of CESTAT. Based on 
a preliminary assessment the Company had already reported the entire claim amount as contingent 
liability. The Company is hopeful of a favourable outcome and does not reasonably expect to have 
any material financial impact. 
 
Kindly take the same on your records.  
 
Thanking you,  
 
Yours faithfully,
