of Rs. 70 crores within the agreed timeline, pursuant to which the ARC has discharged the underlying mortgage 
and returned the original title documents through the Security Trustee, Vistra ITCl (India) Limited . 
On November 6,2025, the Company intimated the Exchange regarding revocation of the in-principle One-Time 
Settlement (OTS) dated August 4, 2025, originally granted by the ARC to the Company and its two Wholly 
Owned Subsidiaries. The Company is disputing the revocation of the OTS and is taking appropriate legal 
recourse. 
The Exchange is hereby informed that the insolvency proceedings initiated by JCF ARC against the Company 
under Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, were subsequently heard by the National 
Company law Tribunal, Bengaluru Bench. Upon hearing the matter, the NClT, Bengaluru Bench, has passed an 
order disposing of the said insolvency proceedings and with this the application filed for initiation of CIRP 
under Section 7 of IBC is hereby dismissed.
