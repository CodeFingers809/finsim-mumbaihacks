New Delhi-110096
We have reviewed the consolidated unaudited financial results of Rama Steel Tubes
Limited (the "Parent"), its subsidiary (the parent and its subsidiary hereinafter referred to as 
the "Group"), (refer paragraph 4 below) for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 and the 
year to date results for the period April O 1, 2025 to September 30, 2025 which are included in 
the accompanying 'Statement of unaudited consolidated financial results for the quarter and 
half year ended September 30, 2025', the statement of unaudited consolidated assets and 
liabilities as on that date and the· statement of unaudited consolidated cash flows for the half­
year ended on that date (the "Statement"). The Statement is being submitted by the Parent 
pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (the "Listing Regulations, 2015"), which has 
been initialed by us for identification purposes. 
The preparation of the Statement in accordance with the recogmt10n and measurement 
principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 (Ind AS 34) for Interim' Financial 
Reporting, prescribed, under Section 13 3 of the Companies Act,'2013 as amended, read with 
relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India 
• read with the Circular, is the responsibility of Company's management and has been
approved by the Board of Directors of the Company. Our responsibility is to express a
conclusion on the Statement based on·our review.
We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review
Engagements (SRE) 2410, "'Review of interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons 
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance
with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we
would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit.
Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
We also performed procedures in accordance with the Circular issued by the Securities and
Exchange Board of India under Regulation 33(8) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 as amended, to the extent applicable.
The financial statement includes results of following entities:

LIMITED REVIEW REPORT 
To 
The Board of Directors 
MIS Rama Steel Tubes Limited 
B-5, 3rd Floor, Main Road, Ghazipur
New Delhi-110096
We have reviewed the unaudited standalone financial results of Rama Steel Tubes Limited 
(the "Company") for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 and the year to date results for the 
period April 01, 2025 to September 30, 2025, which are included in the accompanying 
"Statement of unaudited standalone financial results for the quarter and half year ended 
September 30, 2025", the statement of unaudited standalone assets and liabilities as on that 
date and the statement of unaudited standalone cash flows for the half-year ended on that date 
(the "Statement"). The Statement has been prepared by the Company pursuant to Regulation 
33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as 
amended (the "Listing Regulations, 2015"), which has been initialed by us for identification 
purposes. The Statement is the responsibility of the Company's management and has been 
approved by the Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to issue a report on the Statement 
based on our review. 
We conducted our review in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 
2410, "Review oflnterim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the 
Entity" issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This Standard requires that 
we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the Statement is 
free of material misstatement. 
A review is limited primarily to inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures 
applied to financial data and thus provides less assurance than an audit. We have not 
performed an audit and accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the Statement has not been prepared in all material respects in accordance with 
the applicable Accounting Standards prescribed under Section 13 3 of the Companies Act, 
2013 and other recognised accounting practices and policies and has not disclosed the 
information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations, 
2015 including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material 
misstatement.
