The first half of FY 2025–26 marks one of the strongest phases in RMC’s growth 
journey. We have delivered robust performance across Solar EPC, Electrical EPC, and 
Electrical Products, with consolidated revenues more than doubling year-on-year.
This performance validates the strength of our integrated business model, in which 
each vertical complements the others to drive sustainable, profitable growth. Our 
SPVs continue to serve as project-specific entities, while the core leadership, strategy, 
and execution excellence remain firmly rooted within RMC Switchgears Limited.
Our Solar EPC business gained strong traction with new project wins and steady 
progress across PM-KUSUM, rooftop, and ground-mounted segments. The Electrical 
EPC vertical continues to expand across Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Northern India, 
underscoring our credibility as a trusted implementation partner for utilities. 
Meanwhile, our Electrical Products division, led by Feeder Pillars, FRP fencing, and 
Smart Enclosures, is emerging as a high-margin growth driver, fuelled by safety 
compliance mandates under CEA guidelines.
We also see immense potential in Smart Metering, with over 250 million 
replacements anticipated over the next five years. RMC’s deep electrical expertise 
and EPC capabilities position us to play a meaningful role in this national 
opportunity.
Our 1 GW Solar Module Manufacturing Plant in Jaipur has achieved financial closure 
and is moving toward commissioning. As we scale responsibly, our focus remains on 
technology, sustainability, and value creation, ensuring that RMC continues to power 
India’s renewable and electrification journey.

Mr. Ankit Agrawal
Whole-time Director & CEO
Message from the Whole-time Director & CEO
The first half of FY 2025–26 has been a clear validation of our strategy — translating 
intent into performance. What we are witnessing is not just growth in numbers but 
growth in consistency, scale, and operational maturity.
Our consolidated revenue reached ₹221.61 crore, representing 112% year-on-year 
growth. EBITDA increased by 71% to ₹34.00 crore, and PAT nearly doubled to ₹20.05 
crore. With a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.59x, interest coverage of nearly 5x, and DSCR of 
4.4x, our balance sheet remains robust and growth-ready. The working capital cycle of 
~60 days and ₹14 crore headroom in fund-based limits demonstrate our ability to 
expand without compromising liquidity or control.
The movement in EBITDA margin from 19.4% to 15.6% was intentional and aligned 
with the Company’s strategic focus on expanding profitability in absolute terms. As all 
verticals including Solar EPC, Electrical EPC, and Electrical Products achieved break-
even, the emphasis shifted from percentage margins to sustained growth in total 
earnings, resulting in stronger profitability and a more resilient business model.
Encouragingly, this momentum is expected to continue into the second half. 
Historically, H1 has always outperformed H2 due to execution cycles and seasonality, 
and we expect this trend to hold, supported by a strong project pipeline and ongoing 
tender activity exceeding ₹1,500 crore.
With the 1 GW Solar Module Manufacturing Plant in Jaipur moving forward post-SIDBI 
sanction, we are well-positioned for the next phase of backward integration and 
margin enhancement from FY27 onwards. The enthusiasm visible across our teams, 
customers, and partners makes this one of the most promising phases in RMC’s 
journey — a period of disciplined growth, sustained execution, and accelerating scale.

kilometers, already electrified as of March 2025.
Transition to Electric Vehicles
The government is pushing forward to create a sustainable 
vehicular ecosystem. By 2030, the sale of conventionally fueled 
vehicles will be prohibited. In line with this vision, it's projected 
that 30% of vehicles will be electric, while the remaining 70% will 
transition away from traditional fuel sources.
Universal Household Electrification 
In a landmark achievement, the government has illuminated 
every household under the 'Har Ghar Bijli' mission. But the 
endeavour doesn't stop here. With the PM KUSUM Yojana, the 
aim is to extend electricity accessibility to every farmer, ensuring 
that progress touches every corner of the country.

Reducing Electrical 
Loss in Maharashtra's 
High-Density Zones
Problem:
▪ Energy meters were situated in deeply recessed, poorly lit areas, 
making access and reading challenging.
▪ Rampant meter tampering incidents were reported. Even when 
detected, intimidation and threats prevented whistleblowing.
▪ Regions like Kalyan, close to Mumbai, witnessed up to 53% power 
loss primarily due to illicit power theft.
Innovative Solution:
▪ Introduction of RMC's Multi Meter Boxes: These units encapsulate 
12 meters in a single structure, complicating consumer efforts to single 
out their individual meters.
▪ By eliminating easy access points, these boxes ensure protection 
against tampering attempts.
▪ Strategically relocating these boxes to main roads achieves dual 
objectives: simplifying meter reading tasks and reducing tampering. 
Their public positioning acts as a deterrent, making tampering 
attempts risky and less likely.

Safeguarding Distribution 
Transformer Centres in 
Jaipur
Challenge & Government Guidelines:
▪ Rising incidents of public electrocutions due to 
unguarded access to electrical distribution 
infrastructure in Jaipur.
▪ Activities like using transformer corners as urinals 
introduced grounding issues, amplifying electrocution 
risks.
▪ Central Electricity Authority (CEA) stipulates fencing 
around accessible transformers:
1. Shield uninformed public and animals from 
electrocution dangers.
2. Contain potential fires and mishaps within the 
transformer vicinity.
3. Ward off street vendors and unaware individuals, 
ensuring their safety.
4. Preserve the cleanliness and functionality of 
transformer areas for lineman safety and repair 
efficacy.
Solution & Implementation:
▪ The shift to FRP fencing aims to not only safeguard 
the public but also ensure the durability and efficiency 
of the Distribution Transformer Centres.
▪ Metal Fencing: Initially adopted across Rajasthan. 
While effective, they were frequently stolen due to 
resale value, posing financial and technical challenges 
for Discom.
FRP (Fibre Reinforced Plastic) Fencing Advantages:
▪ Theft-resistant due to zero resale value
▪ Sturdy and equivalent to metal
▪ Minimal maintenance and cost-effective
▪ Rust-proof

Mitigating Power 
Theft - The Multi- 
Meter Box Solution
Problem:
▪ Energy Smart meters in Mumbra near Kalyan were 
tampered with to steal power. This was cited by 
Torrent Power as one of the first instance of power 
theft via smart meter tampering. The solution came 
from the introduction to Multi Meter Boxes: These 
cabinets are designed to accommodate multiple 
energy meters (single or three-phase) with a single 
incoming connection. Each meter's connection ends 
within the box, drastically reducing tampering 
potential. The locked metering chamber houses the 
meters, while outgoing wires connect to an accessible 
chamber for linemen.
Multi Meter Box Strategy:
▪ Relocation & Grouping: Position energy meters 
outside consumer premises, especially in areas not 
easily visible from main roads, and cluster them 
together. This setup discourages individual 
tampering.
▪ Access Control: Design meters to be inaccessible to 
linemen, allowing only the outgoing connection box 
to be reached. This further reduces chances of 
tampering from inside.
▪ Enhanced Security with Multi Meter Boxes: These 
boxes, designed to accommodate multiple energy 
meters (single or three-phase), ensure connections 
end within the box. A locked metering chamber 
safeguards the meters.
▪ Shielded Wiring: Wires, both incoming and outgoing, 
are neatly organized and protected within the boxes. 
Cable tray covers are employed to ensure a neat, 
complication-free setup, making them invisible from 
the outside and reducing tampering potential.
