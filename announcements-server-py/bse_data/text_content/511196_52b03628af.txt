Rationale and key rating drivers 
CARE Ratings Limited ( CareEdge Ratings) has reaffirmed rating s of long-term bank facilities and debt instruments  of Can Fin 
Homes Limited (CFHL) at CARE AAA+ Stable. Reaffirmation continues to factor CFHL’s strong parentage, with Canara Bank (rated 
CARE AAA; Stable ) as the primary shareholder holding 29.99%  as on September 30, 2025. The parent provides board level 
oversight, strategic guidance  and shared brand franchise . Despite its modest shareholding, Canara Bank considers CFHL a 
strategically important entity and has reiterated its commitment to provide support while maintaining its equity stake.  
Supported by its parentage and track record, CFHL enjoys strong financial flexibility, enabling it to raise funds from divers ified 
sources at competitive rates. Ratings also reflect CFHL’s relatively low -risk loan portfolio, with  a dominant share of salaried 
borrowers, its continued healthy financial performance, stable profitability, strong asset quality, and adequate capitalisation levels. 
These strengths outweigh credit challenges arising from high leverage , regional concentration and competitive housing finance 
segment. 
 
CareEdge Ratings has withdrawn the rating assigned to the Tier II bond (ISIN: INE477A08025) non-convertible debenture (NCD) 
issue (ISIN: INE477A07308, INE477A07316, INE477A07324, INE477A07332 and INE477A07340) of CFHL with immediate effect, 
as the company has repaid these NCDs in full and there is no amount outstanding under the issue as on date. 
  
Rating sensitivities: Factors likely to lead to rating actions 
Positive factors: Factors that could individually or collectively lead to positive rating action/upgrade 
• Not applicable 
 
Negative factors: Factors that could individually or collectively lead to negative rating action/downgrade  
 
• Weakening credit profile of Canara Bank.  
• Change in Canara Bank’s philosophy towards CFHL or announcement of stake sale.  
• Increase in gearing (total debt/net-worth) beyond 8x levels.  
• Weakening asset quality with gross stressed assets of above 5% on a sustained basis. 
 
Analytical approach: Standalone 
Standalone, factoring in the linkages with Canara Bank, with whom, CFHL shares the brand name and derives  managerial and 
financial support. Canara Bank’s management has also reiterated its strong commitment to support the entity. 
 
Outlook: Stable 
The stable outlook reflects CareEdge Ratings' expectation that CFHL will continue to benefit from its strong parentage with Canara 
Bank, sound financial metrics, and consistent profitability supported by comfortable asset quality.

Press Release  
Key strengths 
Strong parentage 
CFHL is promoted by Canara Bank (rated ‘CARE AAA; Stable’), which held a significant stake of 29.99% as on September 30, 
2025. As its sponsor, Canara Bank provides board -level guidance, managerial support, and shared brand equity, while also 
enhancing CFHL’s financial flexibility. Three senior Canara Bank officials, including its Managing Director and CEO, K 
Satyanarayana Raju, serve on CFHL’s Board. Can ara Bank considers CFHL a strategically important entity and has reiterated its 
commitment to support the company, despite its modest shareholding and intent to maintain the stake. CareEdge Ratings expects 
this support to continue going forward. 
Comfortable asset quality  
CFHL’s loan book is largely retail -focused, with ~70% of the portfolio comprising loans to the salaried and professional class as 
on September 30, 2025. Housing loans dominate the portfolio at ~8 5%, while the balance is diversified across mortgage/loan 
against property, top-up loans, and personal loans. The predominance of salaried borrowers, and adequate collateral cover, has 
supported comfortable asset quality metrics over the years.  In the housing loan segment, average incremental ticket size stood 
at ₹25 lakh, with a conservative average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of ~47%. In hon-housing segment average ticket size stood at 
₹14 lakh. Asset quality remains healthy though marginally moderated, with gross non-performing assets (GNPA) rising to 0.94% 
as on September 30, 2025 (March 31, 2025: 0.88%) and net NPA (NNPA) at 0.48% (March 31, 2025: 0.46%) , while provision 
coverage stood at 48.79% for NPA loans. 
Although company operates in a highly competitive housing finance environment , CareEdge Ratings expects asset quality to 
remain comfortable, supported by the company’s prudent underwriting and secured portfolio mix. 
Diversified resource profile 
CFHL’s borrowing profile is well-diversified across instruments. As on June 30, 2025, term loans from private and public sector 
banks formed the largest share at 53.46%, followed by NCDs (21.69%), refinance from the National Housing Bank (16.56%), 
commercial paper (7.78%), and deposits (0.51%). The company also maintains significant undrawn credit lines, including working 
capital limits amounting to ~₹7592 crore as on June 30, 2025, as part of its liquidity buffer. 
Adequate profitability metrics  
The company has reported consistent profitability supported by stable net income margin (NIM), controlled operating and credit 
costs. NIM remained steady at 3.50% in FY25 (FY24: 3.62%) while Opex/ average total assets were stable at 0.61% (PY: 0.57%). 
Credit costs declined to 0.20% in FY25 from 0.40% in FY24, contributing to a marginal improvement in return on total assets 
(ROTA) to 2.21% (FY24: 2.16%).   In H1FY26, the company reported a profit after tax (PAT) of ₹ 475 crore on total income of 
₹2,070 crore, compared to ₹411 crore on ₹1,894 crore in H1FY25. ROTA in H1FY26 stood at 2.30% (H1FY25: 2.19%).  
CareEdge Ratings expects profitability levels to remain stable supported by healthy spreads and asset quality. CHFL’s focus on a 
stable business model has allowed it to withstand competitive pressures, ensuring portfolio expansion without undermining 
profitability. 
 
Key weaknesses 
Regional concentration of operations  
CFHL is a moderately sized player in the housing finance industry. The loan portfolio has witnessed growth of 9.2% in FY25 and 
further growth of 3.8% in H1FY26 and stood at  ₹39,657 crore as on September 30, 2025. The company’s operations remain 
concentrated in Southern India, where 56% of its 234 branches are located, contributing ~68% of total advances. CareEdge 
Ratings expects this regional concentration to persist in the medium term. 
High gearing levels  
Healthy profit generation has helped the company maintain a comfortable capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of 25.58% as on 
September 30, 2025, against regulatory requirement of 15%. Overall gearing improved to 6.74x as on September 30, 2025, from 
7.45x as on March 31, 2024, and 7.02x as on March 31, 2025, though it remains higher than most peers. CareEdge Ratings 
expects gearing to remain capped at ~8x in the near -to-medium term. Risk of operating with relatively high leverage is partly 
mitigated by CFHL’s focus on low-risk housing loans, with salaried borrowers. The company’s ability to raise funds at competitive 
rates from diversified sources has further supported its ability to sustain higher gearing while maintaining adequate capitalisation. 
 
Liquidity: Adequate 
Per the asset liability management (ALM) statement as on June 30, 2025, CFHL’s liquidity profile is characterised by no negative 
cumulative mismatches in time bucket supported by sanctioned undrawn lines of ₹7592 crore maintained by the company. Without 
 
3 CARE Ratings Ltd. 
 
Press Release  
considering undrawn lines, ALM profile is characterised by negative cumulative mismatches from above one month bucket due to 
longer tenure of loans compared to borrowings. As on June 30, 2025, the company had cash and bank balance of ₹305 crore and 
investments of ₹ 2326 crore against debt repayment obligation of ₹ 14,118 crore for the next one year. Expected inflows from 
advances in the same period stood at ₹5,708 crore. CareEdge Ratings draws comfort from the company’s demonstrated ability to 
raise funds at competitive rates through its diversified resource base considering strong parentage and its robust performance. 
 
Environment, social, and governance (ESG) risks    
Given the service-oriented business of the CFHL, its direct exposure to environmental risks and climate risks is not significant.  
 
Environmental: CFHL’s direct environmental risks are limited. CFHL recognises the importance of energy management and has 
started quantifying energy consumption in terms of energy units. The company works on installation of solar roof panels in villages 
and focuses on waste management. CHFL prioritises business model resilience through regular risk assessments, contingency 
planning, diversification of revenue streams, market monitoring and investment in technology and innovation. 
 
Social: Ensuring data security and customer privacy is critical to protecting customer information from cyber -attacks and data 
breaches. CFHL recognises the importance of fostering a corporate culture that encourages open communication, feedback, and 
embraces diversity and inclusion.  
 
Governance: As on September 30, 2025, the Board had 10 Directors, including six Independent Directors. Governance standards 
remain high, with multiple Board committees, compliance with Secretarial Standards, and oversight through a dedicated 
committee and periodic reviews.
