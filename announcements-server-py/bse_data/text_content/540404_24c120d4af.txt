Commenting on the results Mr Hiren Ghelani, Founder and Whole Time Director, Prime Fresh Limited, said: 
“Dear Shareholders, our performance for Q2 FY26 was a steady quarter for Prime Fresh, marked by consistent 
operational execution and continued progress on our strategic initiatives. Consolidated Revenue for Q2 FY2026 stood 
at X66 crores, with EBITDA (excluding Other income) at ¥4 crores and PAT at X3 crores, reflecting a YoY growth of 11%, 
despite a volatile demand environment and seasonal variations in key commodities. Sales volumes reached 16244 MT, 
translating into a YoY increase of 96%, supported by healthy traction across fresh produce, processing, logistics, and 
export segments. 
Our focus on strengthening backward integration and improving supply-chain precision continued to yield results 
hugely unfavourable climatic challenges. Overall capacity utilisation improved, cold-chain efficiencies enhanced 
routing performance, and throughput across major procurement clusters remained robust. These operational gains, 
along with disciplined cost management, helped maintain stable realizations and supported margin resilience during 
the one of the most difficult quarter in last 5 years. 
During HI FY26, Prime Fresh made substantial progress in advancing its long-term growth roadmap. The 
development of our Peri-Urban Vegetable Cluster in Nashik moved forward meaningfully, supported by preliminary 
approvals received from the National Horticulture Board (EOI was approved). These initiatives are expected to 
significantly enhance our sourcing depth, farmer coverage, processing capabilities, and value-added offerings over 
the coming years. 
Our ongoing work in enabling farmer empowerment through training, input support, aggregation infrastructure, and 
digital traceability continues to drive measurable impact. The Company remains committed to reducing post-harvest 
losses, improving quality consistency, and ensuring better value realization for growers across key geographies. 
From our balance sheet’s perspective, we have already initiated measures to improve collection cycles and optimise 
inventory turns, which are expected to reflect progressively in the coming quarters. We also welcome the reaffirmation 
of our CRISIL BBB /Stable credit rating that exemplifies our financial flexibility & strengths and supports our planned 
expansion initiatives. 
Looking ahead, we expect growth to be driven by stronger performance in key fruit and vegetable categories, improved 
seasonal availability, and expanding institutional and export demand. With a well-integrated supply-chain model, 
growing distribution footprint, and a clear execution roadmap, Prime Fresh is well-positioned to deliver sustainable 
growth through the remainder of FY26 and beyond. However, we are seeing a very challenging climatic environment 
impacting our long-term growth rate during H2 of FY2026. Prime Fresh is putting special efforts and adding new 
geographies, products and sales partners to counter these challenges. 
With a well-integrated supply-chain model, a strengthened distribution footprint, and a clear execution roadmap, Prime 
Fresh remains well-positioned to deliver sustainable growth through the remainder of FY26 and into FY27.”
