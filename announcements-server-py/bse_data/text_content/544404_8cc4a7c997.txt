Key Dimension Insights & Drivers Implications for Investment
Market Size & Growth • India produces ~4.5–5 million tonnes of synthetic fibre annually; 
~80% consumed domestically
• Polyester filament yarn (PFY) is ~2.53 million tonnes in 2024, 
expected to grow to ~3.06 million tonnes by 2030 (CAGR ~3.2%).
• Synthetic fibre overall growing at ~5.6% CAGR through to 2030.
Strong growth in addressable market provides runway for capacity 
expansion, product diversification, and scale economies.
Export Potential & Global Positioning • India is among the top exporters of polyester yarn; exports to over 
100 countries, including Turkey, Brazil, Bangladesh. 
• Globally, ranks third in polyester yarn exports (after China, 
Vietnam)
Good potential to increase export market share, especially if 
product quality, certifications, and supply chain logistics improve; 
favorable for foreign investment or export‐oriented facilities.
Key Growth Drivers / Trends • Rise in demand for athleisure, performance & technical textiles. 
• Sustainability: increased demand for rPET / recycled polyester 
yarns and biodegradable variants.
• Government incentives: e.g. Production Linked Incentive (PLI), 
quality / standardization schemes.
• Innovation in new yarn types: low shrinkage, high modulus, etc.
Opportunity to differentiate via sustainable products (GRS-certified, 
biodegradable), technical innovations; government policy can 
reduce risk and support scaling.
Challenges / Risks • Rising imports of industrial yarn (increasing competition). 
• Capacity utilization is moderate; capacity growth relatively slow 
compared to demand. 
• Costs: raw materials, energy, compliance (quality / regulatory) 
are pressures.
Need investment in efficiency, cost management, possibly 
backward integration of raw materials; ensuring regulatory 
compliance and quality for export markets.
Forecast & Upside to 2030 / 2033 • Synthetic fibre sector projected to grow from USD ~3.24B in 2024 
to ~USD 6.53B by 2033 (~7.5% CAGR). 
• Strong domestic demand + growing export capabilities + 
sustainability preferences expected to shape winners.
High return potential for players able to scale sustainably; first‐mover 
advantage in recycled / biodegradable / technical yarns; 
attractive entry points for capital investment.
