Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and a warm welcome to all of you. I am Janhavi Patil 
from Orim Connect, Investor Relations of Nakoda Group of Industries Limited. 
On behalf of the Company, I would like to thank each one of you for joining us today for 
Nakoda's First Eamings Conference Call to discuss the financial and business performance for 
2nd Quarter and Half Yearly Results ended 30th September. This has been an affirmative period 
for the Company known for its strong presence in the Tutti-Frutti and food processing segment. 
The Company has taken a significant strategic step into the FMCG space with the launch of its 
energy drink under the brand NO CTRL. The early market response has been positive, with 
rising distributive interest and expanding availability across traditional trade, modern retail and 
quick commerce. 
Now I am pleased to introduce the members of the Management Team present with us today. 
Mr. Jayesh Choudhary — Whole-Time Director; Ms. Sakshi Tiwari — Chief Financial Officer. 
With that, T now hand over to Mr. Jayesh Choudhary for his opening remarks. Thank you and 
over to you, sir. 
Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for the Q2 and H1 Financial Year 25- 
26 Earnings Call. 
This has been an important period for the Company, marked by strong strategic progress and 
continued strengthening of our business fundamentals. Over the past few months, we have 
remained focused on building a more diversified and consumer-oriented business platform, 
while ensuring stability and consistency in our core operations. One of the key highlights this 
year has been the launch of our new beverage brand, NO CTRL, marking our entry into the high- 
growth energy drink and flavored carbonated beverages segment. This strategic move expands 
our presence beyond the traditional food processing category and positions us to capture the 
strong consumer shift towards youth-focused FMCG categories. The early response has been 
encouraging, with rising offtake, repeat orders and growing interest from distributors. To support 
this momentum, we are strengthening our distribution architecture with a balanced focus on

traditional markets, modern retail, and digital channels. Our presence across B2C, e-commerce, 
and quick commerce platforms, including Blinkit, has widened consumer access and enhanced 
visibility. We are also onboarding additional distributors across Tier 2 and Tier 3 regions to 
decpen market penctration. At the same time, the core food processing business continues to 
remain resilient and stable, with an established footprint across 23 states and a strong export 
presence. We continue to serve marquee clients across ice cream, bakery, confectionery, catering 
and institutional segments. Consistent product quality and reliable supply continue to reinforce 
customer confidence. 
We are also investing in operational enhancements, automation, digital upgrades, and tighter 
expense control to strengthen productivity, reduce wastage, and further streamline our cost 
structure. 
Now, I will come to our financial performance. Q2 and H1 Financial Year 26, have delivered a 
strong financial turnaround, supported by improved demand, higher efficiencies, and enhanced 
product mix. Revenue increased 58% year-on-year in Q2 and 20% year-on-year in H1, reflecting 
board-based traction across both core and new categories. Lmportantly, profitability strengthened 
meaningfully, driven by improved operational efficiency and a notable increase in trade 
volumes. Trade continues to offer better margins, and the scale-up in trade activity during the 
period contributed significantly to the improvement in gross margins, EBITDA margins, and 
overall profitability. The Company reported positive EBITDA and net profit in both Q2 and HI. 
EBITDA reached Rs. 103.37 lakhs in Q2 and Rs. 186.87 lakhs in HI, while net profit stood at 
Rs. 25.11 lakhs in Q2 and Rs. 40.84 lakhs in H1, EBITDA margins improved to 6.99% in Q2 
and 8.61% in H1, supported by disciplined cost management, operating leverage, and margin- 
accuracy trading. 
On the balance sheet front, long-term borrowings reduced sharply from Rs. 103.36 lakhs to Rs. 
63.4 lakhs, while cash-on-cash equivalents nearly doubled to Rs. 90.86 lakhs, strengthening 
liquidity and supporting future growth plans. 
Now I will come back to the outlook of our Company: 
Looking ahead, the company remains focused on four priorities scaling the FMCG beverage 
vertical with deeper distribution and continuous product innovation, expanding presence across 
unpenetrated domestic markets with a strengthened sales and distribution network, enhancing 
digital and modem trade reach, particularly across quick commerce and organized retail, 
continuing operational efficiencies through automation, technology upgrades, and tighter 
execution.

With a stronger business model, a diversified product portfolio, and improving financial 
fundamentals, we are well positioned to sustain growth momentum and deliver long-term value 
to all stakeholders. Thank you. 
‘We will now move to the detailed review of our performance. And with that, I would like to 
open the floor for the question-answer session. 
Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. We'll take our first 
question from the line of Jay Menaria from Menaria Investments. Please go ahicad. 
First of all, congratulations on a good set of numbers. 
Thank you so much. 
So, I have a question regarding the revenue. So, how much of the Quarter 2 revenue came from 
the agro-based business? And how much came from the new energy drink which you launched? 
Right now, the entire revenue came from the existing business, because we have launched energy 
drink from 28% October. And the revenue of the product will come in the Quarter 3. The entire 
revenue which we got it from in the Quarter 2, that we got it from our existing business. So, it 
means that the revenue which is already grown up, that is from the existing business itself and 
now we think that the revenue will increase more as new business will be added in Quarter 3. 
Okay, sir. So, we saw EBITDA margins from minus 1.87% to 7% roughly. So, what structural 
changes did we do? 
Like, first of all, we have reduced the debt. The long-term borrowings got down. So, that's why 
the financial cost came reduced. Secondly, the revenues also increased that has compiled the 
profit also. And we have controlled expenses. So, basically, all together has increased EBITDA. 
and profit margin. 
Okay, sir. And currently, we are selling our products on Blinkit and quick commerce apps. 
Yes, just now we have started this basically. This Blinkit, I guess it has been started from last 
two days. 
Okay. And so, do we have presence in the traditional stores such as Reliance or DMart or are 
we planning to do that? 
Yes, we are planning for that. Initially, we started with quick commerce and now we are 
appointing distributors. We have already some distributors, but we are appointing specific 
distributors for the energy drinks and we are trying to connect the existing distributors of Coke

or Pepsi or the distributors which left the distribution of Coke or Pepsi due to some marginal 
issues. We are connecting to them and we are appointing them because they have a good 
knowledge of spreading the material in the retailers because they have a good market and the 
channel setup. So, they can do it easily. So, that will give a presence in the market basically. 
Okay. And sir, we also saw a sharp decline in the other expenses. So, from 121 lakhs to 46 lakhs 
year-on-year? 
So we are controlling actually the expenses part very well. And the second thing where the 
revenue is increased, that's why as compared to that, you can sce that the expenses percentage 
will be less only, if you compare the figures. So, that's why the percentage dropped down. 
Okay, sir. And sir, about the raw papaya capacity. So, I can see that we have 100 metric ton per 
day capacity. And the utilization is currently around 8 to 10 metric ton per day. 
No, that is the 8 to 10 metric ton is the finished product capacity and 100 metric ton capacity is 
for the raw material processing. 
Okay, sir. And sir any plans to increase the current utilization or do any additional CAPEX for 
the same? 
Right now, we are utilizing in the tutti-frutti business, we are utilizing around 60% to 65% 
capacity of finished goods. Currently, we don't have any plans for the CAPEX increase. But I 
think we will increase the utilization first. 
Okay, sir. And sir, one more thing, are we having any plans to export in the export market? 
We are already doing export to more than, I guess, 20-25 countries, including like US and South 
American countries also, we are doing exports. And this export business, we have a very good 
hold in the export business. I think in this category, tutti-frutti category, we share around 60%- 
70% export market. Whatever the quantity is getting exported from India, in the tutti-frutti 
product, I guess we are exporting, directly exporting and exporting through merchants, exporters 
around 60%-65% quantity. 
And sir, what percentage of revenue comes from the exports versus the imports? 
We don't do any imports. We do only exports. There will be selling of the products. Basically 
what we do, we export sales through merchant exporters. So, that are our direct customers only, 
like international buyers are directly from our side only. But we do exports from merchant 
exporter because if we directly export to the specific country, then we cannot appoint multiple 
distributors in same country. That will be a restriction. That's why we do merchant export, we 
do exports through merchant exporters. So, that avail us to keep multiple distributors in single

country. That gives us more visibility of the product in the country. So, basically, I think we are 
doing around $1 million exports, like around 8 crores-10 crores that comes around 20% revenue, 
whatever we are getting in the entire year. Like 20%-25% export revenue is there. 
Okay. Sir, what is the current beverage production capacity? 
We have done a contract manufacturing agreement with Patel Beverages and they have a 
capacity of around 24,000 cans per day in one shift, like 1000 boxes, like 24,000 cans per day. 
So, there is no issue of capacity right now. We have sufficient capacity to capture market and 
for the beverage brand, we are exploring like Maharashtra, we are initially starting up with 
Maharashtra and then later on, we will increase our business with Telangana and Chbattisgarh 
and slowly, slowly, we will increase our range also. So, basically, we don't have any problem of 
‘manufacturing capacity right now. The main thing is that how we market the product right now 
and how we place our product, how we position our product in the retail market. 
Okay, sir. And one more question is like, for the new product, we are planning some marketing? 
What will be the average marketing spend? 
I think we have already started the marketing plans and we have started with social media 
‘marketing first because that is more cheaper. Secondly, we are approaching to the, basically, our 
product is mainly sold in the clubs, in the pubs and in the restaurants. So, we are approaching to 
all these categories and approaching and placing our product there. So, I think we, it will be 
around whatever the, like we have placed marketing expenses around 10% or 15% of the 
product. We have a clear budget of that. 
Okay. And what's the gross margin for the new product? 
Gross margin is around 40%. 
40%. Okay, sir. Sir, I will join back in the queve. 
Yes, thank you. 
Thank you. Next question is from the line of Aditya Melra from Credit AMC. Please go ahead. 
Thank you for the opportunity. T had a few questions. How are you planning to gain market share 
on the new energy drink that you launched? 
So, as I told right now that we are approaching clubs. And first ofall, we will appoint distributors. 
Again, we are trying to appoint basically experienced distributor who have market, who have 
the knowledge of the market in the beverage brands. So, that will give us very, we will approach 
to the retailers very fast. And then we are placing our products to the A grade counters, where

the movement of the energy drink is more. And connecting to the clubs and basically marketing 
our product and marketing our products to the clubs, like pubs and clubs, placing our product 
there. 
Okay. And our target market will be tier 1 or tier 2 cities? 
Tier one. First of all, metro cities, then tier one. 
Okay. Thank you. 
Thank you. Next question is from the line of Prachi Shah from Research Capital. Please go 
ahead. 
So, first of all, congratulations for the new brand. And I have a question, like what drove the 
decision to enter the energy drink and the flavored beverage segment? 
Thank you so much. Basically, the Company has thought that the leader of the market in energy 
drink is Red Bull currently from last 10-15 years, last 20 years. And there is not a big, there is 
no major player, Indian player who is taking care of this market and selling energy drink in India. 
So, the thought of the Company was to bring Swadeshi drink, Swadeshi energy drink, instead of 
getting this energy drink, like India is buying around 11,000 crores or 12,000 crores product, 
energy drink product from outside India. So, the thought was that to give Swadeshi energy drink 
to India in cheaper cost. 
Okay. Regards to the same, can you help me with like what was the initial consumer response, 
the repeat order trend and the carly transaction? 
We have just placed our product to the retailers and we got good review from the retailers as 
well as the consumers. We are getting small order of repeat orders. And I think in next three 
months, we will get the exact position that review we have got it very good reviews we got as 
compared to the leader of the market, like our product is unique and it's better than other 
competitors, but the exact repeat orders, I can say that it will take to analyze one quarter at least 
that how we get the repeat orders and how we will increase the sales. Basically, right now, this 
is the very early stage to tell this answer, basically, because we have just started this product 
placing to the retailers. 
All right. Also, can you confirm like you have five SKUs right now, right? Take the flavors. So, 
I was saying that are there any plans to scale the product portfolio within the beverage vertical? 
Currently, we have launched three SKUs, that is energy drink, classic and pineapple coconut 
mixer and the third one is mango and peach mixer. In pipeline, we are we are developing, we 
have developed basically Ginger ale and Kiwi & Lime. We will be launching this in next two

months. And we'll scale up also. Also, we will also add some few more SKUs with different 
flavors of mixers. As well as we will we are also adding up o control mineral water. This will 
side by side promotion basically, this will help us to promote our mixers because like mineral 
water demand is more and visibility will increase the brand visibility will increase because 
mineral water is more faster moving product as compared to energy drink. This will help us to 
promote energy drink visibility as well as the mixer visibility and the brand entire brand 
visibility. So, in next few months, you can see no control mineral water and few more SKUSs in 
the beverages. 
I have one more question. So, you said for both the mineral water and beverages sector like s it 
vast and how much are you planning to scale the product portfolio for the same like what is the 
revenue? Can you let me know the expected revenue contribution as well for FY'26 and '27? 
1 think that 25-26 will be a will be early phase, but we can see that Financial Year 2627 the 
revenue will be we feel that it will be almost double because this segment is very different and 
entire new distribution channel is required and in Financial Year 25-26 we will set up 
everything and then the result will come basically from Financial Year ‘26-27. So, we sec that 
there will be an exponential growth basically in the revenue. 
All right. Thank you. That answers my question. Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. Next question is from the line of Jay Menaria from Menaria Investments. Please go 
ahead. 
I have a question regarding the cash conversion cycle and the trade receivables. So, we saw that 
the trade receivables have reduced. So, have we changed our credit policy or something? 
No, we have not changed any credit policies, but I think in the entire market right now, the cash 
liquidity is more and as the demand of the product is more. So, our customers usually don't keep 
too much of credit. Basically, they release the payment because we have the policy that if some 
bills are due and they need more material, like they have more orders, so they have to clear the 
old bills. So, that's why basically the cash cycle s, we have a good cash cycle in this. So, that 
has been, basically it has been improved due to more orders. 
Okay, sir. And what is the target cash conversion cycle we are targeting for like Financial Year 
26 and 277 
T think this is the best right now. And for the energy drink, we are trying to get the payments in 
advance, but I think in six months, like in two quarters, we will improve more in the cash cycle 
because our beverages brand will increase the cash equivalents.

Okay, sir. And so for the Financial Year 25, we saw that the operating cash flows was negative. 
So, when do you expect that the operating cash flow will tum to positive? 
Basically, this will increase slowly, slowly now because we have reduced the long-term debt. It 
is almost nil, almost nil, like it's already reduced. So, the cash flow will also improve side by 
side because the EMIs was very heavy and that has been reduced now. 
Okay, sir. That's all from my side. Thank you. 
Thank you. As there are no further questions, I now hand the conference over to Ms. Janhavi 
Patil from Orim Connect for the closing remarks. Over to you.
