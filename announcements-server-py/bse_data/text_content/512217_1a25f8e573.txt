Limited Review Report on Standalone Financial Results 
To Board of Directors of M/s Prism Medico & Pharmacy Limited 
We have reviewed the Standalone Un-Audited Financial Result of *M/s. Prism Medico And Pharmacy 
Ltd* having its Regd. Office at Suketi Road, Kala Amb, Sirmaur, Himachal Pradesh — 173030 for the 
Quarter ended 30th September2025 (“the Statement”) attached herewith, being submitted by the 
company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including relevant circulars issued by the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (SEBI) from time to time. 
This statement is the responsibility of company’s Management and has been approved by the Board of 
Directors. Our responsibility is to issue a report on these financial statements based on our review. 
We conducted our review in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagement (SRE) 2410, 
Engagement to “Review of Interim Financial Information performed by the independent auditor of the 
entity” issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan 
and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the financial statement is free of 
material mis-statement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of company personal and analytical 
procedures applied to financial data and thus provide less assurance than an audit. We have not 
performed an audit and accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe 
that the accompanying statement of Standalone Un-audited Financial Result prepared in accordance 
with applicable Accounting Standards i.e Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind AS’) prescribed under 
section 133 of Companies Act, 2013, read with relevant rules issued there under and others recognized 
accounting practices and policies has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of 
Regulations 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligation and Disclosure Requirements). Regulations 2015 including 
the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
