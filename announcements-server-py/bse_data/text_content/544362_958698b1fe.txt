SMC Squared Named a 2025 SMU Cox Dallas 100 Winner — Marking 
Third Time on the Prestigious List 
India, U.S.A, November 21, 2025: SMC Squared, a part of Hexaware Technologies [NSE: HEXT], is 
pleased to announce that the company has been named to the 2025 SMC Cox Dallas 100 list of 
fastest‑growing privately held businesses by SMU Cox School of Business’s Caruth Institute for 
Entrepreneurship. This recognition reflects SMC Squared’s sustained momentum, strategic impact, 
and leadership in global talent and Global Capability Center (GCC) services. 
The Dallas 100 honor is awarded annually to the region’s 100 privately held entrepreneurial 
companies that exhibit strong revenue growth over a three‑year period, based on evaluation by the 
Caruth Institute. 
What makes this year’s announcement especially meaningful is that SMC Squared has now earned 
the Dallas 100 designation three times. The company was previously recognized in 2021 and again 
in 2022. This places SMC Squared on a very short list of companies to have consistently achieved 
this level of recognition — a testament to the organization's sustained growth, strong execution, and 
resilience in a competitive services landscape. 
“Being named to the Dallas 100 for a third time is a real credit to the SMC Squared team and the 
clients who have trusted them. Their work in building high-quality GCCs sits at the heart of 
Hexaware’s GCC 2.0 service line and the value it aims to deliver,” says Chinmoy Banerjee, 
President & Head – North America, Hexaware. 
“To be recognized again by the Dallas 100 is a tremendous honor. This marks our third time on the 
list, and it underscores the hard work, creative energy and dedication of our entire global team and 
our clients. As we continue to help multinational companies build world‑class GCCs and accelerate 
their strategic goals through global talent strategies, this recognition inspires us to push even further,” 
says Patricia Connolly, Senior Vice President & Global Head, SMC Squared. 
SMC Squared’s integration into Hexaware Technologies recently has strengthened its service 
capabilities and reinforced its position as a trusted GCC solutions provider. 
The 2021 recognition saw SMC Squared ranked #8 among the Dallas 100, becoming one of the 
top‑ranked female‑owned and led companies on the list. The subsequent 2022 acknowledgement 
reaffirmed its growth trajectory and excellence in the GCC and talent‑strategy domain.  
“We view this latest recognition as a reminder of our commitment to delivering value to our clients 
and to building a strong, people‑first culture,” added Connolly. “We’re grateful to our clients, our 
teams, and our partners for making this possible.” 
SMC Squared remains focused on expanding its Global Capability Center offerings, helping clients 
reduce costs, mitigate risk, and access top‑tier talent while scaling digital and technology operations. 
The Dallas 100 recognition reinforces the company’s position as a thought leader and trusted 
partner in global workforce strategy.
