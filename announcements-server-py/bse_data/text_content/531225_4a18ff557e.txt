Commenting on the results, Mr Ramarao Mullapudi - CEO, President & Director of 
XTGlobal Infotech Limited, said, 
"At a time when the global technology landscape is going through a significant shift, the Indian 
IT sector continues to face macroeconomic pressures, tariff constraints in the US, and rising 
client expectations for Al-led efficiency. Despite these challenges, the sector has displayed 
resilience, adaptability, and a commitment to creating value. 
Our standalone Q2 FY26 performance remained steady, with EBITDA growing 14.2% QoQ and 
PAT increasing 16% QoQ, supported by healthy margin improvement. On a consolidated basis, 
revenue grew 2.3% QoQ and EBIT rose 5.4%, reflecting ongoing productivity gains. For H1 
FY26, consolidated revenue grew 90.4% YoY and PAT expanded 47.1%, driven by continued 
operational momentum. With Network Objects added as a subsidiary in January 2025, 
consolidated YoY comparisons reflect the broadened business base. 
Our ability to leverage and scale AI responsibly will be central to accelerating our transition 
from stability to stronger growth. With a clear focus on innovation, customer priorities, and 
disciplined execution, we are confident of delivering sustainable value to shareholders.”
