Investors Presentation Q2FY26
Overview
We have successfully put the pandemic behind us and achieved the Seventeenth consecutive quarter of sustained profitable 
growth.
We continue to dominate with our market leadership in the Pan-Asian/ Oriental cuisine segment. Our USP is the presence of 
our brands in multiple formats ranging from Fine Dining, Casual Dining, Resto Bar, Cloud kitchens and Confectioneries. We will 
continue to build on our expertise and also keep innovating with newer formats to cater to the evolving palate of consumers.
 
We continue to focus on controlling the costs and enhancing the value proposition for our guests. Recognising the 
convenience and importance of home delivery to customers, our focus on providing last mile delivery continues. It remains a 
significant proportion of our total revenue. Despite the convenience of home delivery, we are happy to report that dine-in sales 
are stable.
We have plans to expand by opening new outlets of Oriental Cuisine and dominate the space by upgrading existing Mainland 
China and Asia Kitchen by Mainland China restaurants as a brand refresh exercise to further improve upon the same store 
sales growth. Together with Oriental Cuisine restaurants we have also planned expansion with new outlets of Siciliana, Sweet 
Bengal and Walters.
Given that our versatile brand portfolio enjoys a strong recall and customer loyalty, we hope to further strengthen our brand 
presence in the minds of our customers by continuing to focus on giving every diner the perfect guest experience and making 
them feel special.
