Reference : Outcome of the meeting of Board of Directors held on Saturday, November 15, 
2025. 
Subject :  Disclosure under Regulation 30 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure

Dear Sir/Madam, 
                                                                      
In continuation of the Outcome of the Board Meeting dated November 15, 2025, submitted pursuant to 
Regulation 30 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements), 2015, we wish to inform 
you that the Board of Directors (“Board”) of Calcom Vision Limited (the “Company”) in their meeting 
held today i.e. Wednesday, November 19, 2025, while deliberating the issuance of EGM notice for the 
proposed preferential issue, discussed that some more investors had approached the management for 
possible investment in the Company to participate in future growth opportunities.   
 
It was also discussed that since the company’s growth capital requirement is also more than the proposed 
Preferential Issue size (i.e. Rs. 8,99,99,922/-), as approved earlier, thus, it was decided to defer the fund 
raise by way of the proposed preferential issue and explore other fund raising options, for such amounts, 
as may be needed, from other forms like Rights Issue or any other method allowing wider participation 
including QIP.  
 
The Board further authorized Mr. Abhishek Malik, Executive Director and Mr. Pramod, Chief Financial 
Officer to present various options in the next Board Meeting and constituted a Committee of Directors 
to evaluate and finalize the proposals. 
 
Further details would be informed in due course of time. 
 
You are requested to kindly take the same on records.   
 
Thanking you,  
 
Yours faithfully,  
For Calcom Vision Limited

Company Secretary & Compliance Officer
