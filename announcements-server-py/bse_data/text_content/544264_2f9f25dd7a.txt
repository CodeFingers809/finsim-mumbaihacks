With that, I now open the floor to any questions you may have. Thank you for your time and 
continued support. 
Moderator: We will now begin the question -and-answer session. The first question comes from the line of 
Suyash Bhave from Wealth Guardian. 
Suyash Bhave: In the previous call, we had indicated that Q2 and Q4 are our stronger quarters. In this quarter, 
we had a relatively flattish top line on both Q oQ and YoY basis. Are we facing any execution 
or demand related issues? Can you throw some more color in this context? 
 Diffusion Engineers Limited 
November 17, 2025 
 
 Page 5 of 11 
Prashant Garg: You have asked about two things. One is demand related issues and execution related issues.  
Demand, we are in fact, if you see our order book vis-à-vis last year and even at the end of the 
last quarter and end of the last financial year, it significantly improved.  As far as execution is 
concerned, so we are not seeing any problem with the demand related issues and going forward 
we are seeing further improvement of the order book. Now, coming to the execution bit, if you 
see H1 numbers last year versus H1 numbers this year, there is a certain portion in our offering 
which is called as roller press rolls. Now, typically we have a current order book of (+) 100 
crores of roller press rolls, but these orders take time for execution because it involves sourcing 
of heavy forgings which have a long lead time from Europe.  And by the time they come to us, 
and we do further value addition, it's a lead time of 8 to 9 months, sometimes extending up to 
10 months. So, some of these orders which H1 last year we had executed close to 20 crores 
worth of these orders last year, it has not contributed as much in this H1, but we are seeing that 
in the course of execution, these numbers will start coming in the Q3 and Q4. So that's why Q2 
looks flattish this year.  But other parts of the business has shown improvement and it's only 
mainly because of the reduction in the roller press orders that Q2 has come out to be flattish. 
Suyash Bhave: Regarding the order book, so yes, we have a very robust order book growth in this H1, almost 
100 crores of new orders, and mainly led by the heavy engineering vertical. Have we taken in 
these orders for good margins or did we have to adjust our margins to secure these orders? And 
in general, going forward, do you see the revenue mix tilting more towards heavy engineering 
division? 
Prashant Garg: The reason why heavy engineering looks bigg er in the total order book is because the heavy 
engineering comes with a longer lead time, whereas welding consumables comes with a 
shorter lead time and wear plates and wear parts are in between these two segments in terms of 
lead time. Now coming to your part of the question regarding the margins to book these orders. 
These orders have come in as a result of the work that we've been doing over the last 3-4 years. 
So, the total order book stands at close to 209 crores, out of which 170 crores is from heavy  
engineering. Now, a large chunk of this comes from the initiatives that we have taken last 3 -4 
years back, and we deliver those items in the industry, and they started performing and the 
customer has come back and ordered for more. So, we don't see any re duction in the margins 
for these orders and going by the current raw material price spends, in fact, if anything, the 
margins are going to be slightly better only in comparison to what we had executed them 
before. 
Suyash Bhave: One last question. Going forward, we don't see a major trade towards heavy engineering as in 
it will still be an equal revenue mix or would it be a more heavy engineering dominated mix? 
Prashant Garg: The industry is also moving away from buying just products towards wear plates and wear 
parts and also going towards heavy engineering because when we just sell welding 
consumables, it requires the end -user to hire skilled labor to apply these consumables on their 
industrial equipment. So, clearly, the direction in which the industry is moving involves 
sourcing of more and more of wear plates, wear parts services as well as heavy engineering 
and therefore, the increase in the business coming in from heavy engineering, wear plates and 
 Diffusion Engineers Limited 
November 17, 2025

wear parts will be far more, the growth there will be f aster than the growth in the welding 
consumables business. 
Moderator: The next question is from the line of Sunil Jain from Nirmal Bang Securities. 
Sunil Jain: My question relates to expansion. Can you talk about the status of both the expansions? 
Prashant Garg: We have expansions going on at two sites. One is at Nimji plant, and the second one is at B33. 
I will start with Nimji first. So, in Nimji we are almost at the plinth level in the construction 
phase of our new facility that we are expanding behind o ur existing facility. The erection is 
going to start from this week onwards and we are expecting to finish the building by the end of 
the Q4. Already, as far as the electrification is concerned, we have got the necessary approvals. 
The order for high -tension items have been placed, and they are in advance stages of 
execution. Also, the most important thing in our facilities are overhead cranes.  So, they are 
also in advanced stages of production, and we are expecting deliveries to start from the month 
of January. So, by the time building starts getting ready, the cranes will also be erected and 
ready. So, we are expecting that the plant should be up and by the end of Q4 and we are on 
track for that. We have all the necessary approvals for that. 
As far as B33 is concerned, we have already received the 10 -ton extruder to increase our 
manufacturing capacity. We have also received a slitting line.  So, both these plants are 
expected to go online from this month onwards, from November 2025 onwards. And we have 
already started using the space for testing of our building equipment which we sell also in our 
product line. So, B33 is also going as per our planned activities.  Only the office block that we 
wanted to make in B33 that we are still yet to start, but we do n't foresee any delay in the 
benefits that we get out of it because it's finally an office block and currently we have enough 
office space in our facility. But as far as production activities are concerned, they are on track 
to be online by November within  this month in B33 and in Nimji plant by Q4 2026. One more 
point I wanted to add was that we have already received the 1.4 -megawatt solar rooftop plant 
at our site and that also should get live latest by January end or February in Nimji plant. 
Sunil Jain: For the main Nimji plant, are we started booking order or still there is some time for that? 
Prashant Garg: This heavy engineering order, after the expansion is over, the entire plant will become 
seamless. The existing plant and the new plant and the heavy  engineering order that we have 
will start immediately getting executed in the new space that we are creating behind the 
existing plant. And some of the machines for the new plant has already been installed in our 
existing plant temporarily so that we are not waiting for the new facility to come live before 
we start producing. So, those things have also been taken. And this 200 -crore order book that 
you see, a good portion of this order book will start getting executed in the new plant. We don't 
need separate approvals from our customers to get that plant validated because, as I mentioned, 
it will be seamless with the old plant. So, it will be considered as an extension of the same 
facility. So, we will save on that time to start executing orders there.

Sunil Jain: From this expansion of Nimji, are we likely to get any revenue in the current year or it will be 
starting from the next year? 
Prashant Garg: Predominant contribution will come from the next year onwards. But as I mentioned, the few 
machines that we 've been able to accommodate in our existing plant which was originally 
planned for the new plant that has started contributing. They've come live only from October 
mainly. So, that will start contributing in this year also. So, some contribution will come  but 
majority of it will come in the next year only. 
Sunil Jain: The order book which we have of around 200 crores, what could be the execution timeline for 
the same? 
Prashant Garg: I think only the OE orders and the roller press orders for which there are  scheduled deliveries, 
that will go in the next year, which is approximately  about (+) 80 crores, will go for the next 
year. The balance has to be executed within this year out of the 209 crores. 
Sunil Jain: If you can talk about the demand scenario, that's my last question. 
Prashant Garg: We see increased industrial activity on account of the expansion going on in the steel mining 
and the cement sector. There is robust demand for new equipment in these four industries. So, 
the business that we supply to for the new project built is seeing substantial increase.  Also, the 
fact that we've been able to develop capabilities in the mining sector and in the aluminium 
sector, as we mentioned before, we  are seeing more inquiries and requests for quotations from 
those sectors also, because we've been successful in supplying them large equipment such as 
crushers and wagon tip plers. So, those sort of inquiries have also started coming in. We've 
added some n ew customers in the mining sector.  This is as far as the new project buil d 
business is concerned, which if you remember is not more than 25% of the total business. As 
the industrial output increases in the core sectors, the OPEX budgets have also increased . So, 
the demand for spare parts, maintenance, services and consumables to keep the plant up and 
running has also gone up significantly.  Of course, there is a lot of consolidation which has 
happened in the industry which is good because if you supply in on e plant, you can 
immediately get inquiries from the other plant. But also, it increases competition because there 
are fewer customers because of consolidation and all the suppliers are focusing on that. So, as 
far as the OPEX part of the business is concer ned, where our products are getting consumed 
for the operational and running of the plant, roughly 75% of our turnover comes from that , we 
are seeing increased activity there also. And we see this increase in demand getting sustained 
over the period of short to medium term. 
Moderator: The next question is from the line of Parth Patel from Patel Investments. 
Parth Patel: The first question is that if you see quarter -on-quarter, your finance cost went down, and it 
came up again by about 2 million this quarter. So, is this working capital loan or is this long-
term loan that we have taken? 
 Diffusion Engineers Limited 
November 17, 2025 
 
 Page 8 of 11 
Abhishek Mehta: This is a working capital loan which we have taken. We don't have any term loan in this 
financial year. 
Parth Patel: Secondly, I had a question on the order book , what is the sustainable level of order book that 
we are planning to have over the next few quarters? 
Ramesh Kumar: As earlier question Mr. Prashant was saying, the core industry is considerably growing. So, we 
don't see a big downfall as far as order backlog is concerned after the quarter, after the quarter.  
But definitely, it will be little less because in the Quarter 2, if you see specifically, we have got 
almost about 170 crores which also contribu ted by the roller press roll what Mr. Prashant has 
said earlier. So, there may be a slight reduction in backlog, but definitely it will not be too 
much reduction, what I can say. 
Parth Patel: If we take from a level of 200 crores, so it will be around 170-180? 
Ramesh Kumar: Maybe 170 -180. That kind of thing I think we should be in a position to maintain for next 
couple of quarters. 
Parth Patel: The last thing is that you have reiterated that you will be seeing a double-digit growth 2026 
and 20 %-25% growth f or 2027. I wanted to see what are the chances and what are the 
strategies you have in place to achieve that? 
Prashant Garg: The most important thing is that we need to have the orders to be able to sustain the double-
digit growth. So, that clearly you can see from our order book that we have a substantial order 
book. Second is, the order book needs to align with the quarterly performance and the 
quarterly delivery so that quarter -on-quarter or yearly at least there is an in crease that we are 
promising. So, as I mentioned, out of the 209 crores, 80 crores odd is planned for the next year. 
The balance 130 crores is already in the bag, and we are still at November mid. So, we still 
have four and a half months to go for taking n ew orders and executing in this year.  So, we 
have the order book. We have also got enough time left to be able to execute and the long lead 
orders that had come in the Q2 and Q1 are now getting ready for deliveries in Q3 and Q4. So, 
all of that will contri bute and that will help us enable achieve that number.  Also, the fact that 
the new electrode facility will come live now. The graphite machines that we have added in 
our existing space which is planned for the new space has also come live. We are adding on e 
more machine because there is a limitation of space, but we are able to accommodate one more 
graphite machine which will add to the production capability and turnover which will be 
visible in Q3 and Q4. So, we are confident that what we have been claiming, we will be able to 
achieve by the end of this year. 
Parth Patel: I wanted to ask what is the current capacity utilization we are at and now as you are 
mentioning that there is a sort of a lack of space. So, once the new machine is set in, how are 
we planning to expand the capacities going forward?  Is there going to be a land acquisition or 
any third-party contracts that you are going to look at? 
 Diffusion Engineers Limited 
November 17, 2025 
 
 Page 9 of 11 
Prashant Garg: The moment we try to outsource our manufacturing activities; we will lose out on margin and 
more than the margin the quality is a question mark. And that is how Diffusion has developed 
its capabilities and is basically investing in an in-house facility. So, we don't believe so much 
in third-party contracting especially for our core manufacturing suc h as electrodes, wires, and 
wear plates, and heavy engineering. But coming to the expansion, so we have 30 acres land in 
that premise where we are putting up the new workshop. So, land shortage is not a problem.  
It's just the space, the factory shop floor space that needs to get ready so that the space is 
available. So, the moment that happens once we have more space available, then obviously our 
fabrication and manufacturing capabilities will increase significantly, and we will have more 
space to execute these orders. And in the existing space, whatever maximum we can 
accommodate, we are accommodating.  We are not waiting for the new facility to get ready. 
That's what I meant to say. 
Parth Patel: One last question. Once you run out of the workspace over here and you start building another 
workspace and bringing in all the machinery, what would be the average time it takes to start it 
running and what would be the cost that we would have to incur? 
Prashant Garg: The time basically from concept to build is anywhere between 8 to 9 months from thinking 
about expansion till the expansion gets ready. And money, of course, depends on the size of 
expansion that we are doing. Current investment that we are doing is roughly ar ound 70 crores 
in the heavy engineering area in Nimji plant. And that is almost doubling our current capacity. 
So, we don't foresee another such expansion immediately within the next 2 or 3 years. Even if 
some expansion needs to be done, it will be only ma ybe half of it.  Going by that roughly 
anywhere between 30 to 40 crores should be enough to carry out at least half of this expansion 
going forward. Of course, as we mentioned before, we don't have any long -term loan and any 
term loans. So, we have the fina ncial capability. If the market need is there we can, of course, 
expand more if required as the land is already there with us. 
Parth Patel: I think we have enough reserves for this also. 
Prashant Garg: Yes. 
Moderator: The next question is from the line of Suyash Bhave from Wealth Guardian.  
Suyash Bhave: In our AR as well, we had mentioned about getting into more client verticals, defence, mines 
and railways. Any color on that?  Any progress update or any orders we may have received 
there? 
Prashant Garg: Mining, we have added a very prestigious new OEM, and we are in advanced stages of 
executing one significant order for them. We are already in inspection stages after the 
manufacturing is in advanced stages. And from the existing OEM for which we have made a 
big investment, called as the Tandem Wagon Ti ppler, we have received new orders and there 
are more talks for subsequent requirements from them.  So, mining OEMs business has started 
increasing and we are seeing a good pipeline of inquiries as well as busine ss, not just inquiries 
 Diffusion Engineers Limited 
November 17, 2025

coming from there . Railways, we got a couple of contracts for making parts of the Vande 
Bharat train parts, some critical parts for them. We were able to come L1 in a couple of 
opportunities and now that thing is under order placemen t and there are further discussions 
going on on that front.  The existing business in railways is also increasing, whereas we were 
supplying some wear liners for their ballast cleaning machines. These are basically track 
maintenance machines. So, that versa tile business which was there is still there and it's 
increasing. And defence, of course, we are participating in requirements for welding 
consumables for armouring applications. The earlier order which we had got, I think in Q4 last 
year or Q1 this year i s in the final stages of execution. So, it was an order for 65 tons of 
welding consumables and it's in the last stage of its execution which we get over before the end 
of this financial year. There are new opportunities that we've identified in defence, but we will 
definitely share that once it comes to fruition. 
Moderator: The next question is from the line of Vikram, an Individual Investor.  
Vikram: A question in terms of your guidance where you talk about medium to long term and doubling 
revenues. Do you have a time frame in mind?  Because that is pretty broad in terms of medium 
to long term. 
Prashant Garg: We expect to do that in 3 to 4 years. 
Vikram: Any sense of where we will end FY26?  Because you did mention that we've got orders worth 
about 130 crore, give or take, in addition to the 160 odd that we've done in the first half.  Then, 
of course, you've got nearly four and a half months in terms of winning new orders.  Any broad 
sense of where we'd like to achieve for FY26? 
Prashant Garg: We will maintain our outlook of maintaining double digit growth. 
Vikram: Because again, double digit is very broad. So, I just wanted to get some color. 
Prashant Garg: We would be in mid to late teens. 
Vikram: Final question on operating leverage, you did mention the fact t hat some of the new orders are 
coming in and potentially they could be at slightly better margins given where raw materials 
are, etc.  Obviously, with scale, we will get operating leverage as well.  What is a sensible 
EBITDA margin range that we should work with? 
Prashant Garg: Anywhere between 15% to 17%. 
Moderator: Ladies and gentlemen, as there are no further questions from the participants, I now hand the 
conference over to the management, Mr. Prashant Garg  – Chairman and Managing Director 
from Diffusion Engineers for closing comments. Over to you, sir. 
Prashant Garg: Thank you all for your participation and insightful questions. As we move to FY26, we remain 
focused on execution innovation and scaling sustainably. I would like to express my gratitude
