Narrindra Suranna
Chairman and Managing Director 
“I am pleased to announce that Ddev Plastiks has delivered a robust performance for the first half of 
FY26. Revenue reached ₹1,449 crore, marking a 20% year-on-year increase. EBITDA grew by 16% 
year-on-year to ₹154 crore, representing an 11% margin, while PAT increased by 14% year-on-year, 
totaling ₹99 crore. These results demonstrate our sustained growth momentum despite a challenging 
geopolitical environment.
The widespread electrification across homes, factories, EVs, solar farms, and data centers has attracted 
prominent industry leaders and giant business houses to enter the wires and cables sector. This 
development further solidifies our position as a key supplier of compounds to top players in the 
segment. Sequential improvement in revenue and EBITDA per ton—₹1,41,802 and ₹15,559 
respectively and improvement in our capacity utilization  levels to 84% highlights the strong demand 
landscape for Ddev Plastiks
We remain committed to our long-term goal of achieving ₹5,000 crore in revenue by FY2030, while 
sustaining double-digit EBITDA margins and maximizing capacity utilization. Our capacity expansion 
initiatives are on track, ensuring continued alignment with our ambitious growth strategy.
We look forward to the journey ahead and remain dedicated to delivering exceptional value to all our 
stakeholders.”

WTR XLPE (Water Tree Retardant XLPE) for the insulation 
of cables (72kv application) was primarily imported, 
however, DPIL has introduced an exceptional version 
that has successfully passed a long-term test at a 
third-party laboratory   
Pioneering Product Launches Powered by Extensive R&D
A novel compound highly effective in reducing the growth of electrical treeing caused by water, making 
it a superior choice for insulation purposes.
Successfully passed a two - year test on cable at a prestigious VDE laboratory, Germany.
Reduced treeing result in better service life of the cable resulting into better returns for electrical distribution companies.

XLPE cables offer superior 
electrical insulation, 
improving power transfer 
efficiency and reducing 
electrical faults that could 
lead to short circuits.
They are highly resistant to 
temperature fluctuations, 
making them suitable for 
both indoor and outdoor 
applications, even in 
high-temperature 
environments.
XLPE cables possess strong 
mechanical properties, 
allowing them to function 
effectively in diverse 
environments.
They exhibit excellent 
resistance to chemicals 
such as oil, solvents, acids, 
and alkalis, which prolongs 
their lifespan, especially in 
industries with frequent 
chemical exposure.

Global HFFR Market Size
*In Mn
Halogen Free Flame Retardant Cable (HFFR)
In FY24 : 
India’s HFFR market value stands at USD 613.25 
million, growing at a CAGR of 4.25%
By 2030:
India’s HFFR market expected to increase to USD 778.87 
million. Estimated Global Market ~ USD 4091.3 million.
HFFR used in Solar Panels
• Usage : used in the insulation and outer sheath of photovoltaic 
(PV) cables, which connect the solar panels to the inverter and 
other electrical components.
• Enhanced Safety:HFFR cables are crucial for fire safety 
because they produce significantly less smoke.
• HFFR materials are designed to resist flame propagation.
• Halogen-free materials reduce the environmental impact of 
cable manufacturing and disposal.
• Minimizes the risk of smoke and toxic fumes spreading during 
a fire.
Benefits of using HFFR
• Power Stations and Industrial Plants
• Airports and Transportation Hubs
• Data Centers
• Metro Stations and Tunnels
• Shopping Malls and Commercial Buildings
• Solar photovoltaic systems

Despite the challenges posed by the heavy monsoon and recent US tariff impacts, we achieved strong 
demand this quarter. Looking ahead, we anticipate this positive demand momentum will continue in the 
upcoming periods.
PVC demonstrated strong growth compared to Q1, while HFFR sales were impacted by subdued demand 
due to the effect of US tariffs during this period.
