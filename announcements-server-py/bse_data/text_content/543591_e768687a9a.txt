From the management, we have with us Ms. Liberatha  Kallat, Chairperson and Managing

Sood, Chief Financial Officer; Mr. Sandeep Sonawane, Chief Business Officer. I now hand the

remarks. Thank you, and over to you, ma'am. 
Liberatha Kallat: Good evening everyone and thank you for joining us for DreamFolks Q2 & H1 FY26 earnings 
call. As we reflect on the second quarter of FY26, this period is defined by significant transition 
and resilience. We have navigated a pivotal period in our journey — one defined by strategic 
evolution and purposeful transformation. The quarter saw us take decisive steps to realign our 
business with the changing dynamics of the industry, including the thoughtful transition of a key 
business stream that had served us well in the past. These were not just necessary decisions, but 
forward-looking ones — guided by a clear vision of where the industry is headed and where 
DreamFolks can create the most enduring value. While the impact of these decisions would be 
visible in our  numbers in the short -term, but the actions we have taken have strengthened our 
foundation and positioned DreamFolks for its next phase of growth — one that is more 
diversified, resilient, and in sync with the aspirations of modern travellers and experience-driven 
consumers.  
DreamFolks’ forward strategy is closely aligned with the evolving landscape of India’s travel 
industry — one defined by rapid railway modernization, accelerated highway development, and 
the growing appetite for international travel and premium lifestyle experiences driven by rising 
disposable incomes. These transformative trends collectively create a strong demand for 
premium lounge access and lifestyle services across railway stations, highways, and 
international destinations, catering to the needs of toda y’s discerning and globally connected 
travellers. 
Before we dive deeper into the results for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, I am delighted 
to announce our recent acquisition of Ten11 Hospitality LLP, which marks a significant 
milestone in DreamFolks’ growth journey. Having redefined travel and life style hospitality in 
India by democratizing lounge access and serving over 11 million passengers in FY25, 
DreamFolks is now poised to bridge the premiumization gap that exists in railway travel. With 
more than 7.15 billion passengers using Indian Railways in FY 2024 –25 and large -scale 
infrastructure upgrades underway, the railway lounge segment represents a substantial and fast-
emerging growth frontier. 
Through the acquisition of Ten11 Hospitality, which has a presence at key railway lounge 
locations such as Chennai, Mumbai, and Vadodara — with Chennai already operational and the 
other two set to commence soon — DreamFolks secures direct ownership and ope rational 
control over premium railway lounge infrastructure. This strategic move reinforces our 
  Dreamfolks Services Limited

integrated travel ecosystem and accelerates long -term value creation. By vertically integrating 
lounge operations, we strengthen our partnerships across the value chain, enhance service 
reliability, and mitigate the business risks associated with third-party dependencies, while laying 
the groundwork for rapid expansion into additional high-traffic railway hubs across the country. 
Taking about our performance in the quarter ended 30th September 2025, our revenue for the 
quarter stood at ₹205.5 crores, Gross Profit came in at ₹ 29.2 crores, with a margin of 14.2%, 
EBITDA came in at ₹ 16.1 crores, with margin of 7.8% and PAT came in a t ₹ 11.2 crores at a 
margin of 5.5%.  While our revenues experienced a decline, our Gross EBITDA and PAT 
margins have shown healthy year -on-year expansion. Our strong balance sheet continues to 
provide the financial resilience and flexibility needed to inv est in technology, pursue strategic 
partnerships, and drive growth — both organically and through selective inorganic 
opportunities. 
In response to these shifts, DreamFolks is executing a well -defined strategic shift built around 
four key pillars which are: Global Expansion, Client Diversification, Premium Lifestyle Services 
Addition and Technological Transformation; which will help in positioning us strongly for a 
long-term and sustainable growth.  
Our efforts on Global expansion have also started reaping benefits. All the major lounges in the 
SouthEast Asia and Middle East market are now under our coverage. Our monthly Global lounge 
transaction volume has already more than doubled from Q1 FY26, and we expect it to grow 
manifold in the coming quarters. We now have 900+ Global airport touchpoints outside India. 
On the client diversification side, we are focused on creating strong, recurring revenue streams 
with high retention. Over the past year, we have added more than 30 new enterprise clients across 
the fintech, travel, and lifestyle sectors. To enhance engage ment and loyalty, we are offering 
curated bundles that include global lounge access, social club memberships, coffee -at-mall 
benefits, travel dining, and a range of wellness and entertainment services, enabling our partners 
to deliver differentiated experiences to their customers and employees. 
We continue to reduce dependency on one service by scaling adjacent and innovative offerings 
such as Access to members -only social clubs, Golf, Railway lounges, Coffee -at-malls and 
Highway Dining, all designed to serve the modern traveller and urban custom er beyond airport 
touchpoints. Our non-lounge services also continues to grow, validating our strategy of evolving 
from a lounge aggregator into a broader travel and lifestyle experience platform. Our premium 
offering, Access to members only Social club was also made live with one of the leading global 
bank during the quarter. 
As we expand our service portfolio, we are also accelerating investments in our backbone, our 
tech infrastructure, ensuring our platform becomes increasingly agile, scalable, and aligned to 
the dynamic needs of our partners. 
Our new offerings are designed to meet the rising demand for premium, everyday conveniences 
and lifestyle experiences. By continuously expanding our service portfolio, we are evolving the 
customer value proposition for our clients and their customers, from just travel-focused services 
  Dreamfolks Services Limited 
  November 14, 2025

to a comprehensive travel & lifestyle -mobility ecosystem. We will soon see a huge upgrade in 
the benefits being offered by the credit card companies. 
Moving on, during the Global Fintech Fest in October 2025, we executed a major strategic pivot, 
leveraging our core aggregation capabilities to expand our direct -to-consumer and digital 
offerings. This comprehensive initiative was headlined by three critical launches:  
First, the introduction of DreamFolks Club 2.0, our premium B2C membership platform. This 
represents a significant shift from being purely travel -centric to becoming a holistic lifestyle 
platform, consolidating global lounge access with a comprehensive sui te of benefits including 
social club memberships, golf privileges, and wellness services, significantly broadening our 
addressable market and driving sustainable margins.  
Second, we reinforced our fintech integration strategy through a partnership with WSFx Global 
Pay forex card. This initiative strategically embeds our extensive lounge and travel privileges, 
such as Meet & Assist and airport transfers, directly into their payment ecosystem, ensuring a 
seamless, integrated experience for travellers using forex and travel payment solutions.  
Finally, we collaborated with The Card Company to power 'Wallet α', India’s first premium 
digital wallet on PPI rails. This pioneering product democratizes access to elite experiences —
including our global airport lounge access and premium experiences across the entire consumer 
lifecycle. 
Now coming to the industry dynamics, over the next four years, India’s credit cards issuance is 
projected to double to approximately 200 million cards by FY2028 –29, supported by a ~15% 
CAGR. Credit card transaction volume and value are both expected to expand by 21% and 18% 
respectively. 
India’s premium private club market is expanding rapidly, driven by rising affluent consumers 
seeking exclusive, high-quality lifestyle and networking experiences. The sector is projected to 
grow from ₹576 crore in 2024 to ₹941 crore by 2029 at a close to 18% CAGR. These clubs are 
evolving from recreational venues into sophisticated community hubs for socializing, business, 
wellness, and fine dining. With the continued growth in high-net-worth households, demand for 
premium membership-based lifestyle offerings is set to accelerate further. 
The global lounge industry is also expected to grow significantly. Global passenger traffic is 
forecasted to exceed 12 billion by 2030, driven by growth in APAC & Middle East regions. The 
global airport lounges market is also projected to grow at 14.1% CAG R from 2025 -33, fueled 
by business travelers, leisure passengers and airline loyalty memberships.  
 
The already talked about railway lounge industry is expected to see a boom in the coming years 
due to the government's initiatives to modernize the railway network of the country as well as 
increasing awareness of the consumers. INR 2,400 billion capex is allocated to railways in FY25. 
Also, India is expected to account for 40% of global rail activity by 2050.

We intend to play key role in exploiting these industry macros and we are well positioned to 
take advantage of the same. 
 
To summarize, while this quarter’s financial performance reflects a period of transition, we view 
it as a stepping stone towards stronger, more diversified growth. The coming quarter may 
continue to reflect the short -term impact of recent industry disrupti ons affecting lounge access 
at select locations in India; however, we remain confident in our ability to navigate this phase 
effectively. Our Global Lounge business continues to scale rapidly, and with the introduction of 
new-age benefits on credit cards a nd enterprise programs, we are well -positioned to regain 
momentum and deliver sustainable growth in the quarters ahead. 
At DreamFolks, we are not merely facilitating travel — we are reimagining how people 
experience movement, comfort, and lifestyle across the world. We are excited about the 
opportunities that lie ahead and remain deeply committed to shaping the future of premium travel 
and lifestyle experiences alongside our partners, clients, and investors. Thank you for being part 
of this journey. Over to you Sandeep. 
Sandeep Sonawane: Thank you, Liberatha. 
As we look back at the second quarter of FY26, it stands out as a defining phase of transition 
and determination. This quarter has challenged us in ways few others have, as we navigated 
fundamental changes in our industry landscape, reassessed our operatin g model, and made the 
strategic decision to scale down a legacy revenue stream that once played a central role in our 
business. These choices were made thoughtfully and with conviction — shaped by a forward -
looking view of market evolution and a clear understanding of where our competitive strengths 
will deliver lasting advantage.  
DreamFolks was incepted with the vision of redefining travel services, and over the years, we 
have successfully established ourselves as industry leaders. Today, the company has evolved 
into a comprehensive travel and lifestyle benefits platform, continually broadening the portfolio 
of services. Our strong and long -standing client relationships continue to be one of our biggest 
assets. We are further strengthening these partnerships by working closely with our clients to 
jointly develop new CVP models that go beyond conventional airport offerings.  
We have also recently launched our revamped Club Memberships. It is a step in manifesting our 
founding belief to make premium travel and lifestyle experiences accessible to all aspirants. We 
are now extending premium travel and lifestyle benefits like Acce ss to members -only clubs, 
Golf, Railway Lounge, Global Lounge, Beauty & Grooming, Healthcare, etc. to a wider range 
of customers. 
During the second quarter, one of our premium offering, Access to members only social clubs 
has been made available to one of the global bank’s premium customers. We continued to build 
a strong and expansive network. Our global footprint also expanded, now offering access to over 
900 global airport touchpoints worldwide ensuring seamless travel experiences for our 
customers wherever they go. Geographical expansion continues to be a core strategic pillar for 
  Dreamfolks Services Limited

us. Within India, we are deepening our footprint across emerging cities and travel hubs, 
benefiting from rapid infrastructure development and increasing aspirational travel. 
Internationally, we now enable access in 100+ countries through 3,000+ touchpoints , spanning 
lounges, wellness experiences, golf access, meet & assist and other premium services. This 
broad network not only enhances our customer reach but also strengthens business resilience, 
allowing us to diversify demand across markets and platforms. 
In lifestyle access services, our golf portfolio showed strong momentum. We added 200 new 
touchpoints, expanding our global network to 850+ clubs and increasing our Indian presence to 
73 clubs. Our new premium services like Coffee at Malls where more than 100 outlets have gone 
live in the second quarter and Access to 3000+ members only social clubs are also becoming 
increasingly popular.  
In summary, the four pillars which are Global Expansion, Client Diversification, Premium 
Lifestyle Services Addition and Technological Transformation form the foundation of our 
forward strategy. They reduce category dependence and open up pathways for sustainable, high 
margin growth. 
Q2 FY26 has been a quarter where we have made a paradigm shift in our business strategy and 
our approach going forward. As we continue to execute with clarity and discipline, we remain 
confident in the strength of our platform, the depth of our partnership s, and the direction we’re 
heading to.  Over to you, Balaji. 
Balaji Srinivasan: Thank you, Sandeep. 
I'm pleased to share how our strategic investments in technology and innovation are driving 
tangible results - enhancing client solutioning, end -consumer experience, and optimizing 
operational performance, and reinforcing our position as a trusted partner across multiple 
industries. 
We are at an inflection point in our technological evolution. Our strategic transformation is built 
on a modern, cloud-based platform that enables rapid solutioning and fast-go-live for our clients. 
Critically, we are integrating AI and machine learning mo dels into our technology framework, 
unlocking new capabilities in personalization, analytics, and automated operational processing. 
The recent updates has elevated our platform from a purely benefit aggregation tech, to a 
Consumer Value Proposition designe r, allowing our clients to leverage it as a strategic 
differentiator - delivering specific, intuitive, and personalized experiences for our clients' 
increasingly digital-first customers. The adaptability of our in-house technology positions us for 
sustainable growth as we expand our client and service base into new verticals and geographies. 
A particularly powerful capability is our ML -driven intelligent orchestration system, which 
gives our clients unprecedented flexibility in personalized service selection, pricing, and 
consumption. This technology leverages the tools to enable dynamic selection and combination 
of both traditional and next -generation services, allowing clients to target and configure 
solutions for specific consumer cohorts, that align precisely with their objectives, preferences, 
and budget parameters.

This strategy leverages our fundamental competitive advantage: our platform that is already 
class-leading with technologies like cohort -based benefits, spend -based models, usage -based 
models, fungibility of benefits, benefit aggregation etc., and which is already integrated into 
client ecosystems. 
Now I will hand over to Shekhar for an update on the financials for the quarter ended on 30th 
September 2025. Over to you, Shekhar. 
Shekhar Sood: Thank you, Bala, and a very good evening to everyone. I will begin by giving you the Q2 FY 
'26 highlights first. The company reported a revenue of INR205.5 crores compared to INR316.9 
crores in Q2 FY '25. Gross profit stood at INR29.2 crores in Q2 FY '26 as compared to INR39.2 
crores in Q2 FY '25. Gross profit margin was at 14.2% in Q2 FY '26 compared to 12.4% in Q2

Profit after tax was at INR11.2 crores as compared to INR16 crores in the same quarter of the 
last year. PAT margin is at 5.5% in Q2 FY '26 from 5.1% in Q2 FY '25.  
We continue to have a strong balance sheet with our net worth currently at INR333.1 crores, up 
by 25.8% compared to the same time last year. Our cash and cash equivalent balance as at quarter 
end stood at INR141 crores.  
Now moving to highlights for the H1 FY '26. The company reported a revenue of INR554.5 
crores against INR637.7 crores last year. Gross profit for H1 FY '26 was at INR75.8 crores from 
INR76.8 crores in H1 FY '25. Gross  Profit margin was 13.7% in H1 FY '26 versus 12% in H1

share for H1 '26 stood at INR6.  
Our commitment to delivering sustainable growth remains strong, supported by key factors: a 
robust financial history and an agile tech platform. These trends, combined with strategic 
initiatives, promise a reliable long-term revenue stream. Now with that, I would like to close my 
remarks, and we are happy to open the floor for questions. 
Moderator: Thank you very much. We will now begin with the question and answer session. O ur first 
question comes from the line of Ashish Bahety an investor. Please go ahead. 
Ashish Bahety: I have two questions here. First of all, I want to congratulate the team who is working very hard 
in this difficult time you have gone through over the last  H1, and you are trying your best. So 
that's good. One observation was our employee cost as compared to last quarter of the same 
period, it has slightly came down.  
Are we doing any specific changes the re to reduce the employee cost o r it is because of these 
changes in the -- I mean, segment we are doing? Second question is our cash and bank balance 
have gone down almost by, INR90 million, put together cash and bank balance. overall cash 
  Dreamfolks Services Limited 
  November 14, 2025 
 
Page 8 of 13 
 
flow also in working capital almost about INR41 crores as invested into operation. So I want to 
ask about the reason for this two? 
Shekhar Sood: Okay. So for the employee cost, if you see like majorly, there is a reversal for the ESOP cost for 
the employees who had left. And so that's a major thing that is there. Otherwise,  there is no 
headcount is leaving or something like this that has happening. Mostly the things are in control, 
and this is what we see. Employees are fully confident on Dreamfolks.  
Regarding your second point, which you are asking for cash and cash equivalents. So here, you 
have to see the cash and cash equivalents in complete, including the investment.  So on the 
investment front, so there are investment that we have done in the debt mutual fund.  
So that is there. And coming to another question, which was regarding payment of the creditors. 
So yes, so as per the MSME Act, we have to release our payments to the vendors. So all the 
small vendors and other vendors, they were made  payment as per the schedule. So that's why 
you see that there is a payment happening on the creditors front.  
However, on the trade receivable front, we are yet to receive our funds. So in the 30 days or like 
in the similar time period, we will be getting the inflows. So that's why you would see that even 
compared to last quarter, in total, when you will see all these cash and cash equivalents, including 
with the investments, then the fund flow has actually increased.  
So now it stands at nearly INR141 crores as compared to last quarter, it was only INR48 crores. 
And we will see this trend happening because if you would have analyzed our balance sheet 
more deeply, our current liabilities have reduced quite a lot, whereas our receivables, so we will 
just be now collecting the money and then our cash flow will keep on increasing.  And if you 
would have seen our net worth also, so it stands at INR333 Cr in console numbers. So we are 
about to reach to that balance even in fund flow. 
Ashish Bahety: Okay. That is helpful. And just one more suggestion. On Page 13 of Investor Relationship  
(Presentation), the India's map, the POK is not shown as a part of India. So please take care 
going forward. That's it. Thank you. 
Moderator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nilesh Doshi from Prospero Tree Asset 
Management. 
Nilesh Doshi: First of all, I would like to say best luck to the team of Dreamfolks for their success in the 
company's transformation. It happens in the business. So I like your courage and transformation 
process. I would like to know what percentage of revenue in the quarter 2 is from the airport 
lounge access, number one.  
Number two, do we have still any contract live with the domestic airport lounges or we are 
completely exited from that business? That is my first question. And second, are we shifting our 
asset-light model to asset -based model because just recently, we have acquired some stake in 
the company which (operates) railway lounge. That’s two questions from my side? 
  Dreamfolks Services Limited 
  November 14, 2025 
 
Page 9 of 13 
 
Liberatha Kallat: So the majority of the business or the revenue is from the India airports in Q2. So that is to 
respond to your first question. Your second question in terms of the continuation of the business 
in airports in India domestic lounges. So I would say that you would have actually seen and we 
actually communicated to you that, yes, th e domestic program is discontinued. However, our 
contracts with all our bank partners are still live. 
And that's the only reason what we were mentioning about initiating or starting the new services, 
what we were speaking about.  And you will start seeing that in a couple of months, these 
programs will also go live. In terms of our lounge business, the global lounges are growing. And 
yes, our same clients which were working for our domestic lounge are also migrating and 
working with us closely for the global lounges as well.  
To your question about the business, which is an asset-light and now we are moving to a different 
business (model). So to talk about this, I would say that, yes, as a company, we have actually 
taken this move, one, because we have also learned one of the biggest things in terms of the risk 
to the business because the dependency on the operator was huge. 
 Secondly, right now, in terms of investment into railways would not be as heavy what it would 
be at the airport lounges. So that is also one of the things we thought that, okay, and it is the 
right time right now because it is at a very initial stage in te rms of privatization, in terms of 
getting the infrastructure changes at the railways. So at a minimal cost, I think we are entering 
at this point. And I think this will actually secure and we would be risk-free in the business what 
we are getting into. 
Nilesh Doshi: So can we expect the same run rate of q uarter 2 in the coming quarter o r will it be much less 
than the INR205 crores? 
Liberatha Kallat: It would be much lesser because as I told you that the majority of the volume in Q2 is from 
domestic airport lounges. So of course, the Q3 will not have these numbers. It would (say) the 
top line will drop. 
Nilesh Doshi: All the best from my side and be confident, definitely, we will rise again. 
Liberatha Kallat: Thank you so much. 
Moderator: Our next question comes from the line of Mehul Panjuani from 40Cents.  
Mehul Panjuani: I would like to understand what kind of investments we have made in the railway segment 
because I'm not aware? I am audible? 
Shekhar Sood: Yes. So we have done investment of INR11.46 crores. 
Mehul Panjuani: Okay. And what have we invested? 
Shekhar Sood: Yes, so we have acquired a stake of 50.01% with the effective control there. 
Mehul Panjuani: I'm still not clear what asset have we purchased? 
  Dreamfolks Services Limited 
  November 14, 2025 
 
Page 10 of 13 
 
Liberatha Kallat: So if you actually look at the lounges, these are taken on lease. So it is in the same model the 
way the airport lounges are. So the airport actually gives on lease for 9 to 12 years. Similarly, 
it's the same process at the railways. The railways is giving it to the operator on lease for (period) 
starting from 5 years to 7 to 9 years onwards. And that property on lease is then given to the 
operator. The operator actually builds the lounge and then also -- I mean, takes care of the 
operations as well. So the whole and sole business at that place during the lease period would be 
with that operator. 
Mehul Panjuani: Sorry, I'm not able to hear you very well. 
Liberatha Kallat: Sorry, you were asking something. 
Mehul Panjuani: Yes, I was just trying to clarify, ma'am. So in this case, when you said the operator for the railway 
sector, are we the operator or I mean, what is our goal?  
Liberatha Kallat: Yes. So Ten 11 is the operator, which company where we have actually done the acquisition. So 
yes, now we become the operator. 
Mehul Panjuani: Okay. How much stake have we bought in Ten 11? 
Liberatha Kallat: It is 50.01%. 
Mehul Panjuani: 50.01%. Okay. what kind of access does it give? We present in which cities in the railways? 
Liberatha Kallat: So presently, it  is in Chennai, Mumbai and Vadodo ra. So Chennai is an operational lounge. 
Mumbai should be operational in the next 10 to 15 days and Vadod ora in, I would say, in a 
couple of months. 
Mehul Panjuani: Okay. And ma'am, so if I understand correctly, so the same banks will be having their clients 
coming here to these lounges, and we would be serving these clients, right? Is that correct? 
Liberatha Kallat: Yes. So it is not just going to be limited to the card holders only. There would be walk -ins and 
there were other programs as well. So yes, it would be in the similar lines the way the bank 
program is. which we were already running it from past 5 years. So if you actually see railways 
was also part of our lounge program. 
Mehul Panjuani: How long we have been in the railway lounges? 
Liberatha Kallat: So we were running this for almost 5 years now. 
Mehul Panjuani: Okay. And it was at Chennai? 
Liberatha Kallat: No. So there are a total of 12  railway lounges where we had partnered. But now this company 
where we have done the acquisition, they own and operate the lounges in 3 locations. So Chennai 
is the one which is operational presently, yes.

Liberatha Kallat: We already have access to 15 lounges. Now the 3 would be owned by us. 
Mehul Panjuani: Right. Okay. And how many lounges are there in the global airport sector? 
Liberatha Kallat: So now we have around 900-plus touch points globally. 
Mehul Panjuani: Okay. And what was our revenue in Q2, what is our revenue percentage from the global airport 
sector? 
Liberatha Kallat: So in Q2, it was around 13%. 
Mehul Panjuani: 13%. And the remaining was more or less from the domestic lounges? 
Liberatha Kallat: Yes, yes. 
Moderator: Our next question comes from the line of Deepesh from Maanya Finance. 
Deepesh: Okay. Where is this -- so you're going to open a new one in the Mumbai railway station, which 
railway stations are we looking at? Or we are looking at multiple railway stations of Mumbai? 
Liberatha Kallat: This is at Mumbai Central. 
Deepesh: Mumbai Central. Okay. And going ahead, what guidance would you like to give to the 
shareholders? Is most of the pain out of the system? Or do you still see some going forward in 
the few quarters? 
Sandeep Sonawane: So I think it was already answered. It was -- if you were to look at the results of Q2, the entire 
impact is not seen because as mentioned by the Liberatha the lounges were operational for most 
of the quarters. In the coming quarters, yes, it will have the impact. 
Deepesh: And the new businesses, how much revenues do you see going forward as not right now, maybe 
in FY '27, FY '28? 
Sandeep Sonawane: See, I'll give you an example of, say, a country like China or Russia, where the ecosystem across 
the railways is really developed. I mean China alone offers close to 600, 700 lounges, railway 
lounges that I'm talking about. Similarly, in a vast network, I mean, rail network of Russia, again, 
Russia also has similar kind of lounges.  
With the kind of focus that the Prime Minister is given to the infrastructure development, 
beautification of the railways. We see a bright future, and that is why we thought that it is the 
right time to enter into this market. While currently, it is only  12 to 14 lounges. I think in the 
coming months with the push by the government, we feel that it is very, very exciting space. It 
is going to be a very, very exciting space.  
And yes, it will take time. I mean you also saw the lounge, Airport lounge also took so many 
years. So we feel that it will be faster, much, much faster than what airport became -- airport 
lounge became very, very akin to every individual. I think this wil l also become plus Vande

Bharat trains overall infrastructure. I think we are excited, and that's why we invested in this 
company. 
Deepesh: Any entry barriers do you think this will be presented to future competition? And what will be 
our moat in terms of railway business? 
Balaji Srinivasan: Yes. So what we are doing is what Liberatha mentioned earlier. Now instead of doing the 
aggregation only, we're also getting into the services space, which is why we have invested in a 
company like Ten11 Hospitality  
Moderator: Our next question comes from the line of Tanmoy Roy an Investor. Please go ahead. 
Tanmoy Roy: I am audible? 
Moderator: Yes Tanmoy sir you are audible. Please proceed with your question.  
Tanmoy Roy: So first I wanted to ask regarding what was mentioned to earlier participant that the full impact 
is supposed to come in the next quarter. So assuming now this quarter, we have 13% around 
from the international lounge business. So basically, out of INR200 crores revenue which you 
have, so INR26 crores would be revenue from the other streams. So is it safe to assume that next 
quarter or a few quarters, this INR160-170 crores of revenue will be completely null? 
Sandeep Sonawane: See, we do not want to answer that way. But I'll tell you in terms of guidance that, yes, the India 
Airport lounge will have significant impact in the coming quarters till such time that we actually 
compensate or overcompensate by the new business, which is the global lounge business.  
So global lounge business, I think we have already given in terms of the growth. We have already 
doubled in the Q2, the revenue that used to come from global lounges versus Q1 has already 
doubled. We foresee that these will -- this revenue will multiply ma ny folds in every single 
quarter, and you will hear from us. So I do not want to really forecast in terms of how much that 
is going to be in terms of absolute number. But to answer your question, yes, the impact of India 
Lounge is not fully seen in Q2. It will be seen in Q3 and maybe Q4 as well. 
Tanmoy Roy: So when do you see like the revenue at least flattening, not decreasing? That's what I'm just 
trying to understand. I mean we can understand that impact will be in the next two quarters, but 
I mean, next 4 quarters or 5 quarters, maybe you have some internal this thing. if you like to 
share, it's fine. I mean when do you see it flattening the curve? 
Liberatha Kallat: So see, it is just the beginning right now in terms of the other services and the new thing what 
we are starting, which is into railways. So I would say it would take some time. So it would -- it 
is too early for me to actually give you this guidance. But for sure, in next quarter, we will try 
and give you some guidance because we'll have some clarity. But right now, I think it's too early 
for me to give any clarity on this. 
Tanmoy Roy: Sure, ma'am. I absolutely understand that. So second one, this thing is like now we are investing 
into asset heavy model like railways. So our Ind AS expenses also will go up eventually, right,

from next few quarters, the moment you start accelerating on the railway launches because we 
are leasing more than 3 years. 
Shekhar Sood: Sorry, can you please repeat your question? 
Tanmoy Roy: So now we are investing into the railway lounges, right, which are like asset heavy, like we are 
leasing for more than 3 years. So pre-IndAS also will go up, right, expenses? 
Shekhar Sood: Yes. So investment, yes, there will be the investment that we will be making. But considering 
the future of this business, we foresee that we will be able to get the return of investment quite 
quickly from these. 
Tanmoy Roy: That's fine. I'm not saying that you may get it, but that expenses as IndAS expenses also will go 
up, right, in terms of the depreciation and then interest. 
Shekhar Sood: Yes, for sure. 
Tanmoy Roy: Okay. Those things also will go up, right? Okay. Just one more last question that our employee 
expenses, so what is the current attrition ratio? 
Balaji Srinivasan: Attrition, there is no change in the normal number. It is exactly like last year. So there is no 
special cause of attrition right now. 
Shekhar Sood: So there's no (major) attrition, it's only like maybe 4% or 5% max. 
Tanmoy Roy: Okay. So basically, you are not anticipating like some employee expenses going up even if we 
start accelerating on other businesses than the airport lounges? 
Liberatha Kallat: There could be some additional cost coming in because we are expanding into other services 
and also new geographies. I would say that eventually, the cost -- employee cost will increase. 
Tanmoy Roy: Okay. Thank you. That’s it from my side and all the best ma’am for your fight. 
Liberatha Kallat: Thank you. 
Moderator: Thank you. We will take that as the last question for today. I now hand the conference over to 
Ms. Liberatha Kallat for closing comments.
