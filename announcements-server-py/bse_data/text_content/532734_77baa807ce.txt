International & Domestic Tailwinds 
23 
Global iron ore prices have remained within a 
range of $95 to $110 per ton so far this year, 
currently hovering around $102/t. The first half of 
the year was supported by weather related 
production losses. The second half will see 
increased supply and might put a lid on iron ore 
prices. 
 
Geopolitical tensions continue to impact global 
demand and supply, while China’s stimulus 
measures to boost consumption—including direct 
cash transfers to support population growth—are 
expected to lend some demand support. 2025 
iron ore prices in China are expected to range 
between US$90–105/t, averaging around US$97–
98/t. The World Steel Association, however, 
anticipates China’s steel demand to decline by 2% 
in 2025 and by 1% in 2026 as the housing market 
stabilizes.  
 
Iron ore prices (NMDC – Fines 64Fe) have been range bound 
except seasonal variation between Rs4500-5500/t.  Iron ore 
prices are expected to remain firm with the monsoon finally 
receding. 
Iron ore pellet prices have followed the same trend and has 
traded within a narrow band of Rs.8500 to Rs. 10,000 per/t 
YTD, with current levels around Rs. 9,750/t. Same trend to 
continue for 2HFY26. 
According to the World Steel Association, India’s steel 
demand is expected to maintain strong momentum, growing 
by 9% in both 2025 & 2026, supported by sustained 
expansion across all major steel-consuming sectors. By 2026, 
India’s steel demand is projected to be nearly 75MnT higher 
than in 2020. Demand will be driven by robust growth in 
infrastructure and construction—spurred by government-led 
initiatives such as the National Infrastructure Pipeline and 
Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY).
