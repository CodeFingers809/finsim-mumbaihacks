The company has firmed up damp-lease agreements for 19 aircraft scheduled to join the fleet between October 
and November 2025. Fourteen are already in operation, and the recent return of a reactivated Boeing 737 MAX 
takes the total additions so far to 15. This marks a clear step forward in SpiceJet’s capacity build-up for the 
coming year.
SpiceJet aims to bring up to eight of its grounded Boeing aircraft back into service by April 2026, including four 
in the early winter period to meet peak travel demand. Two have already rejoined the fleet, upto two more 
ungrounded and inducted into the fleet by December 2025, and the remaining four are planned to return by 
early summer 2026.
By the end of 2025, SpiceJet aims to double its operational fleet and nearly triple its Available Seat Kilometers 
(ASKM)
