MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A) – H1 FY26 
 
A. Business Overview 
Logica Infoway Limited (“Logica” or “the Company”) is a pan-India technology retailer and distributor, 
partnering with leading global brands across mobiles, IT products, laptops and consumer electronics. The 
Company operates through four primary revenue streams - Retail, Distribution, E-commerce and Export - and has, 
over the last few years, consciously shifted its focus towards higher-margin domestic opportunities, especially its 
own retail network, while maintaining the scale benefits of distribution and online channels.  
 
The strategy is to grow volumes, deepen relationships with anchor brands and steadily improve the quality of 
earnings by tightening cost controls, sharpening store economics and strengthening systems.  
 
B. Overall Financial Performance – H1 FY26 
 
 Revenue & Gross Profit: 
Revenue from operations in H1 FY26 stood at ₹5,867.02 Mn, a 13.9% increase over ₹5,149.40 Mn in H1 
FY25. Growth was broad-based across domestic segments and reflects healthy throughput from both the 
retail network and distribution partnerships. On a half-on-half basis, revenue was marginally lower by 1.7% 
versus ₹5,966.90 Mn in H2 FY25, largely due to normal seasonality and timing of major sale events. 
 
Gross Profit rose 31.5% YoY to ₹318.41 Mn (H1 FY25: ₹242.05 Mn). Gross margin improved to 5.4% 
from 4.7%, aided by a richer channel mix, better procurement terms and more disciplined discounting. 
 
 EBITDA & Profitability: 
Operating expenses (employee benefits and other expenses) increased moderately to ₹171.99 Mn from 
₹156.53 Mn in H1 FY25, reflecting investments in store expansion, branding and people. Despite these 
investments, operating leverage on a higher gross profit base led to a sharp improvement in operating 
earnings. 
 
EBITDA for H1 FY26 was ₹146.42 Mn, up 71.2% from ₹85.52 Mn in H1 FY25. EBITDA margin 
expanded to 2.5% from 1.7% in the corresponding period, and remained steady compared to H2 FY25 
(2.5%), underscoring a more resilient and scalable operating model. 
 
Profit After Tax for H1 FY26 came in at ₹64.26 Mn, a 98.5% YoY increase from ₹32.38 Mn. PAT margin 
improved to 1.1% from 0.6%, although there is still headroom to enhance profitability in an inherently low-
margin industry. Sequentially, PAT was lower than ₹72.81 Mn in H2 FY25, mainly due to higher finance 
costs and lower other income, while core operating performance remained healthy. 
 
C. Segmental Performance 
Logica’s performance in H1 FY26 was shaped by a strong showing in its domestic segments, particularly Retail 
and E-commerce, while Export was consciously moderated in line with the Company’s strategy to prioritise 
higher-quality earnings. 
 
 Retail: 
Retail revenue for H1 FY26 stood at ₹1,333 Mn, up 70.2% YoY from ₹783 Mn in H1 FY25 and 31.2% 
higher than ₹1,016 Mn in H2 FY25. The surge in retail reflects an expanded store network, improved unit 
economics and better brand visibility. New stores are being opened with sharper discipline on site selection, 
rental levels and minimum revenue thresholds, which is helping the retail business emerge as a key margin 
driver for the Company.

 Distribution: 
Distribution revenue grew to ₹2,547 Mn in H1 FY26, up 13.2% from ₹2,250 Mn in H1 FY25. Compared to 
₹2,776 Mn in H2 FY25, revenue was lower by 8.3%, reflecting seasonality and deliberate focus on 
profitable volumes over aggressive topline growth. Distribution remains the backbone of the business, 
providing scale, brand depth and access to a wide dealer network. 
 
 E-commerce: 
E-commerce revenue increased to ₹1,762 Mn in H1 FY26 from ₹1,355 Mn in H1 FY25, a robust 30.0% 
YoY growth. On a half-on-half basis, revenue was 18.3% higher than ₹1,489 Mn in H2 FY25. The Company 
continues to use e-commerce as a complementary engine to move fast-turning inventory and participate in 
national sale events, while maintaining calibrated capital allocation given the structurally lower margins of 
this channel.  
 
 Export: 
Exports contributed ₹236 Mn in H1 FY26, compared to ₹779 Mn in H1 FY25 and ₹700 Mn in H2 FY25—a 
decline of 69.8% YoY and 66.3% HoH. This contraction is largely intentional: management has chosen to 
reallocate capital and management bandwidth from lower-margin, higher-risk export opportunities to 
domestic channels—especially retail—where returns and visibility are better. 
 
Overall, the segment mix has shifted further towards retail and e-commerce, which, together with disciplined 
distribution growth, is driving the improvement in consolidated margins. 
 
D. Key Themes in H1 FY26 
 
 Mix Upgrading Towards Retail:  
Rapid growth in the Company-owned retail network is steadily lifting gross margins and providing stronger 
control over customer experience and pricing. 
 
 Profitable Growth Over Pure Scale:  
While revenue growth is healthy, gross profit and EBITDA are growing faster than sales, indicating a clear 
focus on quality of growth and store-level economics. 
 
 Tighter Cost and Working-Capital Discipline:  
Despite ongoing expansion, operating expenses remain under control and the business continues to manage 
inventory, credit and financing costs with increasing rigour.  
 
E. Outlook 
On the back of our performance in H1 FY26 and the visibility we have for the remainder of the year, we are 
maintaining the guidance we had earlier communicated in our FY25 Annual Report. For FY26, we continue 
to expect: 
 
 Total Revenue:  
Consolidated revenue growth in the range of 12–16% year-on-year, supported by momentum across all four 
verticals. 
 
 Retail:  
To remain our primary growth engine, with revenue expected to grow by 50–60% year-on-year, driven by 
an increase in store count from around 52 to 100 and expansion of retail space to approximately 60,000 sq. ft. 
 
 Distribution:  
Growth of 8–10% year-on-year, maintaining its foundational role in our overall revenue mix. 
 
 E-commerce:  
Revenue growth of 8–10% year-on-year, supported by rising digital adoption and a broader online product 
portfolio.

 Exports: 
Growth of 10–15% year-on-year, with a clear focus on selective, higher-margin opportunities rather than 
pure volume. 
 
 Profitability:  
An improvement in EBITDA margin to the 2.7–3.0% range, reflecting a stronger gross margin profile and 
an increasing contribution from the retail vertical. 
 
F. Long-Term Vision 
Looking beyond FY26, our long-term vision remains unchanged. Over the next four years, we aim to scale our 
retail network to around 500 stores, deepening our presence across both urban and Tier-2 markets. This 
expansion, alongside balanced growth in distribution, e-commerce and exports, is expected to reinforce Logica’s 
position as a preferred distribution and retail partner for global consumer technology brands in India. 
 
We remain firmly committed to disciplined execution, prudent capital allocation and robust risk management, 
with the objective of delivering sustainable, profitable growth and long-term value creation for all our 
stakeholders.
