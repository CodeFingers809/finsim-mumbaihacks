AION-Tech's ROQIT partners with Indian Railways to transform sustainable, 
door-to-door parcel delivery in India 
Pilot project to begin with South Central Railway, marking the first step toward a nationwide, Al-powered 
logistics transformation. 
Transforming India's Parcel Logistics Infrastructure 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
Hyderabad, November 18, 2025 - Indian Railways has awarded a contract to ROQIT, an AION-Tech 
Solutions Limited Wholly Owned Subsidiary Company, to design and deploy an Al-powered parcel 
logistics platform. AION-Tech Solutions is also pioneering sustainable multimodal transportation solutions 
through its subsidiary ETO Motors. 
The pilot phase of ROQITs solution with Indian Railways will launch with South Central Railway in early 2026, 
paving the way for a nationwide rollout of a fully digital, sustainable, and customer-centric lightweight to 
medium-weight parcel small parcel delivery ecosystem. This initiative marks a significant milestone in 
modernizing India 's logistics infrastructure through technology-driven , sustainable innovation . 
Indian Railways, the world's fourth largest rail network after the United States, China, and Russia, spans 
approximately 68,500-68,600 km of route length. Owing to this vast reach, nearly 70% of its revenue comes 
from freight and 30% from passenger transport, while lightweight to medium-weight parcels weighing up to 150 
kg make up less than 1 % of total traffic volume - far below developed markets where such parcel traffic 
accounts for 4-6%. 
The network remains largely focused on bulk freight, with only 0.5-1 % of its capacity used for small to medium 
sized parce l and package transport, compared to Germany (6%), the European Union (4-6%), and Japan or the 
United States (2-3%). Furthermore, the mixed use of tracks fo r fre ight and passenger trains often causes delays 
in express logistics, while manual booking, lim ited transparency, and unreliable last-mile delivery continue to 
pose challenges. ROQIT's Al-driven platform aims to bridge these efficiency gaps and unlock the untapped 
potential of lightweight to medium-weight parcel small parcel logistics in India by creating a fully digital, 
customer-centric, and environmentally sustainable ecosystem. 
Pavan Chavali, CEO, ROQIT said, "Our collaboration with Indian Railways marks a transformative 
milestone in building India's next-generation , end-to-end Logistics ecosystem-one that combines the 
scale and sustainability of rail with intelligent first- and Last-mile mobility solutions . In the pilot phase, 
we are Leveraging ETO Motors , our electric fleet subsid iary, to power seamless parcel pick-up and 
delivery, ensuring a truly integrated, zero-emission movement of goods. Through ROQIT, we are 
bringing real-time transparency, Al-driven intelligence, and green mobility together to create a future­
ready, point-to-point parcel transportation network aligned with India's Net-Zero vision."

paper-based processes with predictive scheduling, instant booking, digital payments, and real-time tracking. It 
also introduces a marketplace model that allows customers to choose Logistics partners based on cost, speed, 
and sustainability . ROQIT's role in enabling complete first and Last mile pickup and delivery will transform how 
India uses Railways for package transport.

Marketplace Model: Allows customers to choose Logistics partners based on cost, speed, and sustainability 
Implementation Timeline and Sustainability Focus 
The pilot phase of the project is scheduled to commence in January-February 2026 across select Locations in 
the Indian Railways. Following its implementation, Indian Railways will initiate a phased national roll-out to 
expand the platform's reach and impact.

environmental responsibility. This also leverages the Railways' near-100% green transportation capability, 
reducing India's dependence on fossil-fueled road and air Logistics. 
A New Era of Smart Logistics 
The new platform redefines efficiency and reliability in Lightweight to medium-weight parcel delivery by offering 
real-time digital tracking, paperless transactions, and true door-to-door connectivity- capabilities that remain 
absent in most traditional systems. Its open marketplace further empowers Logistics partners with greater 
flexibility and transparency, driving a more inclusive and sustainable logistics model.

• Paperless Transactions: Fully digital booking and payment systems 
• Door-to-Door Connectivity: True end-to-end service capabilities 
• Open Marketplace: Greater flexibility and transparency for Logistics partners

driven logistics in India - one that blends rail's low-cost, low-emission strengths with digital intelligence to 
build a smart, inclusive, and future-ready Logistics ecosystem.
