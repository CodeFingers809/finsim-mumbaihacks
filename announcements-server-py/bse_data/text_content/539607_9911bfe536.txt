Blue Cloud Softech Solutions Limited Signs MoU with Andhra Pradesh Economic 
Development Board to Invest ₹400 Crores in Healthcare Technology 
 
20th November 2025 – Hyderabad, Telangana: Blue Cloud Softech Solutions Limited (BSE: 
539607), an emerging leader in AI and Cybersecurity with robust capabilities in cloud 
computing, digital infrastructure, enterprise solutions, and state-of-the-art 5G technologies, 
is delighted to announces that BCSSL has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding 
(MoU) with the Andhra Pradesh Economic Development Board (APEDB), Government of 
Andhra Pradesh, to invest approximately ₹400 crores in the state’s healthcare sector. The 
MoU was signed at APIIC Towers, Mangalagiri, Guntur District, Andhra Pradesh, in the 
presence of senior officials from both organizations. 
Under the Memorandum of Understanding, Blue Cloud Softech Solutions Limited has 
committed to launching its flagship initiative, “BluBio,” in the prominent cities of Amaravathi 
or Vishakhapatnam. This ambitious project will be developed across a sprawling 3 0-acre 
site, reflecting the company's substantial dedication to the region’s growth and 
technological advancement. 
By 2027, Blue Cloud aims to create 1,200 direct employment opportunities through BluBio, 
providing high -quality jobs in areas such as research, development, operations, and 
administration. In addition to these direct jobs, the project is expected to cataly ze the 
creation of approximately 20,000 indirect positions. These indirect roles will emerge in 
secondary and tertiary sectors, including supply chain management, logistics, service 
providers, and various ancillary units that support the main operations. This multiplier effect 
is anticipated to significantly boost the local economy and foster community development 
by engaging a broad network of stakeholders. 
The investment is strategically designed to drive innovation across key industries —
healthcare, defense, finance, and cybersecurity. Blue Cloud’s advanced AI -driven 
solutions will be leveraged to introduce cutting -edge technologies and streamlined 
processes within these sectors, enhancing productivity, efficiency, and security. The 
establishment of BluBio is expected to serve as a model for scalable AI integration, 
positioning Andhra Pradesh as a hub for technology -led growth and setting new 
benchmarks in industry standards. 
Overall, Blue Cloud’s initiative underscores its commitment to supporting Andhra Pradesh’s 
vision for industrial and economic development. The project not only contributes to 
employment generation but also reinforces the state’s reputation as an attractive  
destination for investment in high -tech sectors, aligned with broader goals of sustainable 
and inclusive prosperity. 
The Andhra Pradesh Economic Development Board (APEDB) will play a pivotal role in 
ensuring Blue Cloud’s successful entry and establishment within the Andhra Pradesh 
market. APEDB’s responsibilities include acting as a liaison between Blue Cloud and various 
government agencies, facilitating introductions, and smoothing the path for necessary 
approvals and clearances at both the state and central levels. Specifically, APEDB will assist 

	
	
Blue Cloud in engaging with the Union Government of India, helping to coordinate 
communications and discussions that are essential for large -scale investments and 
technology deployments. 
While APEDB provides this facilitative support, certain key aspects of the project — such as 
the actual allocation of land for the BluBio initiative, as well as the provision of incentives 
and other benefits — fall under the jurisdiction of specialized departm ents within the 
Government of Andhra Pradesh. These departments will oversee the application, review, 
and granting of land parcels, financial incentives (such as tax breaks or subsidies), and 
other forms of assistance, all in accordance with established legal procedures and relevant 
regulatory frameworks. This ensures that the entire process remains transparent, 
accountable, and in line with state and national development policies. 
By delineating these roles, the MoU aims to streamline the investment process, minimize 
bureaucratic hurdles, and provide Blue Cloud with the institutional support needed to 
realize its ambitious healthcare technology project in Andhra Pradesh. The collaborative 
approach not only accelerates project implementation but also demonstrates the state 
government’s commitment to attracting and nurturing high-impact investments. 
The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Blue Cloud Softech Solutions Limited 
and the Andhra Pradesh Economic Development Board (APEDB) signifies a strong, shared 
vision for advancing infrastructure and driving industrial development in the state of Andhra 
Pradesh. This agreement is designed to foster close collaboration between the public and 
private sectors, aiming to accelerate sustainable economic growth and technological 
innovation within the region. 
As outlined in the MoU, both parties have committed to working together on initiatives that 
not only promote robust industrial activity but also lay the groundwork for the creation of 
world-class infrastructure. This includes the establishment of cutting-edge facilities, such as 
the “BluBio” healthcare technology project, which will serve as a cornerstone for future 
advancements in multiple sectors — including healthcare, defense, finance, and 
cybersecurity. By leveraging Blue Cloud’s expertise in AI-driven solutions, the collaboration 
is expected to introduce state -of-the-art technologies and best practices, thereby 
elevating the local industry standards and making Andhra Pradesh a model for technology-
led progress. 
The MoU is set to remain in effect for a period of 12 months from the date of signing. 
Importantly, it is a non -binding agreement, meaning that while it establishes a formal 
framework for cooperation and signals mutual intent, it does not create any legall y 
enforceable obligations for either party. Instead, the focus is on encouraging open 
dialogue, facilitating investment, and streamlining the process for approvals, clearances, 
and incentives that are necessary for large-scale projects like BluBio. This flexible approach 
enables both Blue Cloud and APEDB to explore opportunities, address challenges, and 
adapt strategies as needed, all within the spirit of partnership and shared goals. 
By committing to this MoU, Blue Cloud and APEDB are demonstrating their dedication to 
creating a conducive environment for high -impact investments, job creation, and long-
term, inclusive prosperity in Andhra Pradesh. The agreement embodies a forward -looking 
approach to economic development, emphasizing transparency, accountability, and a 

	
	
collaborative ethos that benefits not only the signatories but also the broader community 
and stakeholders involved. 
Reflecting on the significance of this milestone, Mr. Tejesh Kodali, Group Chairman of Blue 
Cloud Softech Solutions Limited, stated, “The signing of this MoU represents a pivotal 
moment for both Blue Cloud and Andhra Pradesh. By uniting our technological leadership 
with the state’s progressive vision, we are poised to deliver transformative solutions that will 
redefine innovation and foster inclusive growth.”
