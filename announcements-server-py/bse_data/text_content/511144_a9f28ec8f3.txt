Limited Review Report 
To The Board of Directors of Axis Solutions Limited 
(Previously known as Asya Infosoft Limited) 
We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited Standalone financial 
results of Axis Solutions Limited (Previously known as Asya Infosoft Limited) 
("the Company") for the quarter ended 30th September, 2025 (the "Statement") 
attached herewith, being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of 
Regulation 33 and 52 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, read with SEBI Circular No. CIR/CFD/CMD1/80/2019 dated 19th 
July, 2019. 
This statement is the responsibility of the Company's management and has been 
approved by the Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to issue a report on these 
financial statements based on our review. 
We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on 
Review Engagement (SRE) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information 
performed by the independent auditor of the Entity" issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform the 
review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatements. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of company 
personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus provide less 
assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion. 
Based on our review conducted as above, we draw attention to the note 6 mentioned 
below the quarterly result along with detailed scheme of merger as regarding 
intimated to BSE earlier. Nothing else has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results prepared in 
accordance with applicable accounting standards and other recognized accounting 
practices and policies has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in 
terms of Regulation 33 and 52 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) ~ Regulations, 2015 read with  SEBI Circular N¢ 
CIR/CFD/CMD1/80/2019 dated 19th July, 2019, including the manner in w] c\h_' 
to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement. 
We have not reviewed the accompanying financial results and other financial 
information for the quarter ended 30th September, 2024 which has been presented 
solely based on the information compiled by the Management and has been approved 
by the Board of Directors.
