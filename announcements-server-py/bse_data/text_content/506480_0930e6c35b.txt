GOCL concludes the sale of its subsidiary, IDL Explosives Ltd to Apollo Defence Industries 
• This completes Hinduja Group’s strategic exit from the explosives and detonators business 
portfolio. 
Hyderabad, 17th November: GOCL Corporation Limited today announced the completion of the sale 
of its subsidiary, IDL Explosives Ltd to Apollo Defence Industries, thus completing the divestment 
process approved by shareholders early this year.  
IDL Explosives Limited has manufacturing facilities in Rourkela and many other locations . Apollo 
Defence intends to expand and strengthen the business in line with its strategic plans in the rapidly 
growing Defence Sector. 
With the completion of this divestment process, GOCL and the Hinduja Group will conclude  its 
strategic exit from the explosives and detonator business portfolio. Last year, GOCL ceased operations 
at its Hyderabad plant as the nature of the business no longer aligned with the city’s evolving 
metropolitan landscape. The company continues to hol d substantial landbank and real estate assets 
across the country. It expects to complete the ongoing monetisation of its Hyderabad land in near 
future.   
Following this divestment, GOCL, listed on the Indian stock exchanges, plans to evolve into an energy 
company in line with its long -term growth aspirations, per its stock exchange  announcement dated 
August 29th 2025.
