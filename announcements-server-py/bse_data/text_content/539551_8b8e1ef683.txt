Management Comment 
Commenting on the performance, Dr. Emmanuel Rupert, Managing Director and Group CEO, Narayana Hrudayalaya Limited, said  
“The second quarter of the fiscal year has delivered a strong performance after a steady start to the year. We are pleased to report the 
highest-ever revenue and profitability at both India and the Group level. The performance improvement in India is attributable to strong 
growth in domestic footfall and improvements in payor mix, along with positive traction from our Clinics outreach, resulting in the highest 
ever profitability margins. Our hospital business in Cayman continues to deliver robust performance, with the Insurance business showing 
strong growth , resulting in record revenues for the region . We are confident that the synergies between the hospital and insurance 
businesses will deliver steady growth going forward in the Cayman region. The domestic Integrated Care business continues to be on a 
strong growth path , with our clinics garnering sizeable footfalls  across all locations, providing a positive thrust to the overall business . 
After a steady start, our domestic Insurance business has shown strong momentum this quarter and we expect to build on this further 
going forward. We will continue to invest in this business and are optimistic that it will be a significant driver of growth to the NH 
ecosystem. We thank the investor community for their faith in us and remain confident of delivering on expectations for the year.”
