5. Particulars of the offer including date of passing of the Board resolution, kind of securities offered,

floor price determined in accordance with the provision of Chapter V of SEBI ICDR Regulations, payable in 
cash for aggregating amount of up to Rs. 25,00,00,000/- (Twenty-Five Crores Only). 
 
 
6. Relevant Date 
 
The Relevant Date for the purpose of determining the minimum issue price of equity shares shall be October 
17, 2025 (i.e. being the date, which is 30 days prior to the date of passing of this resolution being the date of 
Extra-Ordinary General Meeting i.e. Tuesday, November 18, 2025). 
 
7. Basis on which the price has been arrived at, justification for the price (including premium, if any) 
 
The Equity Shares of the Company are listed on BSE Limited. The Equity Shares are frequently traded in 
terms of the provisions of SEBI ICDR Regulations and floor price has been determined in accordance with 
the SEBI ICDR Regulations. BSE being the stock exchange has been considered for the purpose of price 
determination. 
 
 
In case of the frequently traded shares, as per Regulation 164(1) of ICDR Regulations, the mini mum issue 
price of the equity shares in preferential issue has to be calculated as under: 
 
a. the 90 trading days volume weighted average price of the related equity shares quoted on the recognized 
stock exchange preceding the relevant date; which computes to Rs. 79.53/- or  
 
b. the 10 trading days volume weighted average price of the related equity shares quoted on a recognized 
stock exchange preceding the relevant date; which computes to Rs. 78.65/-

shares may be issued computes to Rs. 79.53/- each.

(IBBI Registration No.: IBBI/RV/03/2021/14113), having office at Unit No. 125, Tower B -3, Spaze Itech

price determined in accordance with the provisions of Chapter V of ICDR Regulations.
