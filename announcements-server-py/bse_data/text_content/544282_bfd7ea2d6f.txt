Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Facilities Agreement, the Pledgor has pledged its entire shareholding in the Borrower, in ad dition to providing encumbrance on 
shareholder loans and intercompany receivables due to the Pledgor by the Borrower. Therefore, an indirect encumbrance has been created on the Target Company.

representing 16.427% (i.e., 769,000,000 Equity Shares) of the total paid-up equity share capital of the Target Company, resulting in the change in percentage of Sagility  B.V . 
holding in the Target Company from 67.38% (i.e., 3,154,129,152 Equity Shares) to 50.95% (i.e., 2,385,129,152 Equity Shares) on a fully diluted basis, therefore changing the
