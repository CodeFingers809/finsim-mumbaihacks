TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF 
GODAWARI POWER AND ISPAT LIMITED 
We have reviewed the accompanying statement of standalone unaudited financial results 
('the Statement') of Godawari Power & Ispat Limited ('the Company') for the quarter ended 
30th September, 2025 and the year to date results for the period 1 April 2025 to 30 
September, 2025, being submitted by the company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 
33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as 
amended), including relevant circulars issued by the SEBI from time to time. 
This statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and has been approved 
by the Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting 
('Ind AS 34'), prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act'), SEBI Circular 
CIR/CFD/FAC/62/2016 dated 5th July, 2016, (herein after referred to as 'the SEBI Circular'), 
and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to express a 
conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity'', issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A 
review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons 
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review 
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the 
Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act, and consequently, does not 
enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be 
identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under section 133 of the Act, the 
SEBI Circular, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the 
information required to be disclosed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 of the 
SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), 
including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.

July, 2016, (herein after referred to as 'the SEBI Circular'), and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on 
the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the

5. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 
above and upon consideration of the review reports of other auditors referred to in 
paragraph 6 below, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that 
the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under section 133 of the 
Act, the SEBI Circular and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in accordance with the 
requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including the manner in which it is to 
be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement. 
6. We did not review the interim financial results of one subsidiaries included in the 
Statement, whose financial information reflects total assets of Rs.433.19 Crores as at 
30" September, 2025 and total revenues of Rs.33.71 Crores and Rs.64.43 Crores,

and six months ended 30th September, 2025, respectively and cash flows (net) of 
Rs.8.49 Crores for the six months period ended 30th September, 2025, as considered 
in the Statement. These interim financial results have been reviewed by other auditor 
whose report has been furnished to us by the Management, and our conclusion in so 
far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of these
