individually. 
 
The standalone ﬁnancial results of the Feed Division Q2 FY26 results.  
 
 The gross income of Q2 FY26 is INR 1,200 crores as compared to INR 1,279 crores in the 
previous quarter of Q1 FY26. A decrease of INR 79 crores is due to a decrease in the quanƟty 
of feed sold by 10,920 MT and also that being the main season, the Q1, the sales will be more. 
 
 The gross income in Q2 FY26 increased to INR 1,200 crores from INR 1,113 crores in the 
corresponding quarter of Q2 FY25, an increase of INR 87 crores due to an increase in sales 
quanƟty by 19,747 MT.

Avanti Feeds Limited         15.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
 The major raw materials in the feed are ﬁsh meal, soya bean meal and wheat ﬂour. The 
noƟceable development in this quarter is the increasing trend of two major raw materials, that 
is, ﬁsh meal and soya bean meal, resulƟng in proﬁtability when compared with previous 
quarter.  
 
 The prices of these raw materials keep ﬂuctuaƟng since their producƟon is based on 
agriculture and ﬁsh catches from the ocean. The price of ﬁsh meal increased to INR 97 in Q2 
FY26 from INR 93 in Q1 FY26 and decreased from 105 rupees in Q2 FY25. In case of soya bean 
meal, their prices increased to INR 42 per kg in Q2 FY26 from INR 38 in Q1 FY26 and decreased 
from INR 49 in Q2 FY25. However, the wheat ﬂour price increased to INR 33 per kg in Q2 FY26 
from INR 31 in Q1 FY26 and INR 32 in Q2 FY25. 
 
 The present purchase price of ﬁsh meal is INR 125 per kg. Soya bean meal, the high-grade soya 
bean meal, which we procure, is around INR 47 per kg, and wheat ﬂour is between INR 32.5 
per kg to INR 33 per kg.  
 
 While on one hand, the raw material prices are instrumental in determining the margins, on 
the other hand, the status of aquaculture acƟvity, condiƟons such as climaƟc changes, 
diseases, etc., determine the consumpƟon of seed in terms of volume, which will have an 
impact on the overall performance of the company. 
 
 As you noƟced, the nine months of calendar year 2025 has been a good proﬁtable period. 
However, the forecast for the next three months of this year is challenging due to factors like 
gradual increase of raw material prices and the threat of reciprocal tariﬀs by the US.  
 
 To sum up, in general, FY25-26 is expected to be a mix of favourable and challenging seasons 
for the aquaculture industry, both in respect of shrimp producƟon as well as exports from India 
and global demand for shrimp exports. 
 
 
Update on ﬁsh feed 
 
As reported in earlier con call, the company is in the process of imporƟng ﬁsh feed from Thai Union 
Feed Mill Company Limited and is conducƟng trials under Indian condiƟons and also commercial 
viability. Once the product performance is proved and viable, the producƟon in India will be taken up 
for domesƟc sales. 
 
Shrimp feed producƟon and feed consumpƟon in FY25 and company plans for FY26.  
 
Shrimp feed consumpƟon 
 
On the basis of the esƟmated shrimp producƟon of about 7 lakh to 8 lakh metric tons in calendar year 
2025, the feed consumpƟon is esƟmated to be about 12 lakh to 13 lakh MT. The company's feed sales 
during the six months FY26 is 320,208 MT against 293,487 MT in six months FY25. It is esƟmated that 
the feed sales during FY26 would be around 575,000 metric tons. 
 
Shrimp processing and export  
 
The export of frozen shrimps during FY2425 was to the tune of 741,529 MT, of $5,177 million. The USA 
is the largest importer with 311,948 MT of frozen shrimp, followed by China, 136,164 MT; the 
European Union, 99,310 MT; Southeast Asia, 58,003 MT; Japan, 38,917 MT; the Middle-East, 32,784

Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
of quanƟty and value, accounƟng for a share of 43.6% in quanƟty and 69.46% of the total U.S. dollar 
earnings.

Avanti Feeds Limited         15.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
 
K. Srinivas Reddy 
 
Thank you, Mr. D. V. S. Satyanarayana. Now, I would like to update the Pet Food project. As already 
informed, the company commenced trading in cat food from January 2025 our ﬁrst product range 
under AvanƟ Pet Care brand that is Avant Furst in ocean ﬁsh ﬂavour. In July 2025, the company 
expanded its cat food porƞolio with addiƟon of second ﬂavour, tuna. In August 2025, the company 
launched dog food, which consƟtutes the largest share of the pet food industry at around 65%. StarƟng 
with chicken and vegetable ﬂavour and more ﬂavours are planned in the due course. The response 
from the pet owners from the both cat and dog food has been highly posiƟve and market acceptance 
across all regions. 
 
During Q2 FY26, the company recorded a sales INR 95.08 lakh, reﬂecƟng a strong growth from the INR 
38.17 lakhs in Q1 FY26. The sales movement was driven by the conƟnued increase in patronage to our 
cat food products as well as newly launched dog food segment. On the market expansion, company 
conƟnued to strengthen its presence in Tier 2 ciƟes and has iniƟated expansion into type 2 and type 3 
market. E-commerce operaƟons have now commenced. Our products available on the Supertel 
plaƞorm. 
 
AddiƟonally, the company is ready to start trading on Amazon, targeƟng go live before the end of 
November 2025. The company conƟnues to focus on building a strong brand visibility for Avant Furst 
through the ongoing digital markeƟng campaigns on Instagram and Facebook. The ID is Avant Furst, 
enhancing consumer awareness and brand engagement across our target audience. As informed in the 
previous Con call, the company has purchased the land and converted from agriculture to non-
agriculture of approximately 30 acres near Hyderabad for seƫng up state-of-art manufacturing facility. 
 
Presently, project technical works are being discussed with the Bluefalo team and land development 
works are in progress. Upon receiving the required technical inputs, the detailed project report will be 
prepared and obtain necessary government approvals to commence the construcƟon. This is about 
our pet care project. 
 
Now, I hand over to JMD sir for closing remarks. 
 
C. Ramachandra Rao 
 
Thank you, Mr. K. S. Reddy. I am sure that the investors are all happy with the performance of all three 
units, ﬁsh feed, frozen products and also pet care during this ﬁnancial year so far. And with that, I 
would like to just throw some light on the recent developments in this sector so that it will be updated 
on the future performance of the company. 
 
As you know, in spite of the recent challenges, including a major setback caused by U.S. tariﬀs, the 
aquaculture industry conƟnues to demonstrate strong and sustainable growth. This stability is 
supported by several key factors.  
 
The ﬁrst and foremost is the market diversiﬁcaƟon. Producers are acƟvely expanding into new 
geographies and reducing dependence on a single market, which helps stabilize demand and miƟgate 
external risks, dependence on one market. 
 
The second one is the consistent global demand for shrimps. Shrimp remains a high demand protein 
worldwide, supported by steady consumpƟon trends in both established and emerging markets.  
 
7 
Avanti Feeds Limited         15.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
The third one is about value-added products and sustainability iniƟaƟves. The ongoing shiŌ towards 
value-added products and sustainable farming pracƟces enhances the compeƟƟveness, improves the 
margins and strengthens long-term industry viability. 
 
As all of you know, our company, AvanƟ Feeds has been focusing more on the value-added products, 
so that we would be able to take advantage of the emerging markets, favouring value-added products 
where the margins are high.  
 
The fourth trend, of course, last but not least, encouragement for the domesƟc market by the 
Government of India. Recently, the Union Cabinet on November 12, 2025, announced the long pending 
export promoƟon machine for ﬁve years with a total outlay of about INR 25,000 crores to help 
exporters deal with U.S. reciprocal tariﬀs and increase their compeƟƟveness in the turbulent global 
market. 
 
Under the EPM, priority support will be extended to sectors impacted by the reciprocal tariﬀ 
escalaƟons, such as texƟle, leather, gems and jewellery, engineering goods and marine products. The 
intervenƟon will help sustain export orders, protect jobs and support diversiﬁcaƟon and also help 
promoƟon in the new geographies.  
 
Further, Honourable Prime Minister Modi's government is promoƟng domesƟc shrimp consumpƟon 
to support farmers and create a stable market driven by rising export tariﬀs from countries like the 
U.S. Key iniƟaƟves include government commiƩee and the NaƟonal Fisheries Development Board, 
NFDB, to develop a robust local market, suggesƟon to integrate shrimp into government food supply 
chains like military and also proposal for promoƟng shrimp as a healthy lean protein through 
naƟonwide iniƟaƟves. 
 
The reciprocal tariﬀ situaƟon is expected to stabilise with due course as the United States and India 
are making tangible progress in their long awaited trade negoƟaƟons, parƟcularly around tariﬀ 
structures and oil imports. We have recently seen the U.S. proposing to reduce some of the food items, 
dairy products the tariﬀ almost to zero. So, we expect that in the course of Ɵme, the aquaculture sector 
also will be taken care of with respect to tariﬀ balancing. 
 
And this posiƟve momentum provides opƟmism that current tariﬀ challenges will ease over Ɵme, 
supporƟng smaller trade ﬂows and greater market stability. We expect demand for shrimp to conƟnue 
growing and remain sustainable across both global and domesƟc markets. ConsumpƟon trends remain 
strong, supported by shrimp's posiƟon as a versaƟle, aﬀordable and widely accepted protein. 
AddiƟonally, rising health awareness, expansion of retail and food services channels and increasing 
preferences for value-added seafood products are further driving demand. These factors collecƟvely 
reinforce a posiƟve outlook for sustained market growth in the near- and long-term sustainability of 
the sector. 
 
With this, my remarks, I would like now to take the quesƟon-and-answer session. And I request the 
investors to ask their quesƟons.

Avanti Feeds Limited         15.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
 
So, the ﬁrst quesƟon comes from Mr. Akhilesh Rawat from Ridhanta Vision Private Limited. Please go 
ahead, sir. 
 
 
Akhilesh Rawat 
 
Hello. Am I audible? 
 
C. Ramachandra Rao 
 
Yes. 
 
Akhilesh Rawat 
 
Yeah. So ﬁrst of all, I'd like to congratulate management for such a great result in this turbulent 
environment. And I have two sets of quesƟons. So, my ﬁrst quesƟon is, if the 50% reciprocal U.S. tariﬀ 
conƟnues through Q4, what is your quanƟﬁed expected impact on FY26 processing volume and EBITDA 
versus as you menƟoned that 17,000 MTs and guidance for shrimp processing. So, what impact will 
you see in terms of margin and volume? 
 
C. Ramachandra Rao 
 
I think, Nikhilesh, will you take up this quesƟon, please? 
 
A. Nikhilesh 
 
Yes sir. So, hi. Thank you for the quesƟon. You're asking for the full year, right? Full year 2026, what 
impact? 
 
Akhilesh Rawat 
 
Yes. 
 
A. Nikhilesh 
 
Okay. So as of now, we're in Q3. So, the ﬁrst two quarters conƟnued to be good. The performance has 
been good. And for the rest of the year, we're acƟvely working on diversifying into other markets. 
 
However, if things don't normalize on the duty front from January, then we might relook into the 
outlook for the year. Right now, we conƟnue to have it stable, hoping that everything falls into place. 
 
Akhilesh Rawat 
 
Okay. So, can you give a number or, like, kind of volume reducƟon if things don't stay the same, like, 
the tariﬀ charge? 
 
A. Nikhilesh 
 
It's diﬃcult. It's very speculaƟve, and, like, it's everyone's own opinion. Right? So, what we've given is 
17,000 is the current forecast. So, that's what we'll sƟck with.

Avanti Feeds Limited         15.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
 
Akhilesh Rawat 
 
Okay. So my second quesƟon is, as you menƟoned in Q2 FY26 presentaƟon, that EBIT improvement 
was supported by higher other income. So, could you break down the key component of this other 
income? And importantly, like, how much of it is recurring or sustainable going forward? 
 
C. Ramachandra Rao 
 
Yes. The breakup between what is the operaƟonal income and what is the other income? 
 
Santhi Latha 
 
No. He's asking the breakup of other income. Is that what you're asking? 
 
Akhilesh Rawat 
 
Yeah. Like, where is that income coming from? Like, what are the sources? 
 
C. Ramachandra Rao 
 
So, the major income is on the two fronts. One is in respect of feeds. We have deposits, on that we are 
geƫng income from mutual funds, FDs and various porƞolios that we are invesƟng the reserves, which 
is giving the income that is treated as the other income. 
 
And as far as Frozen is concerned, it is the foreign exchange gain that by booking the forward contracts, 
we have been able to make signiﬁcant income out of the ﬂuctuaƟon in foreign exchange. That is the 
other income that is shown in the Frozen division. 
 
Akhilesh Rawat 
 
Okay. Thank you. That's it from my side. All the best for the upcoming quarters. 
 
Moderator 
 
Thank you, sir. The next quesƟon comes from Mr . Ronak Shah from Equirus SecuriƟes. Please go ahead, 
sir. 
 
Ronak Shah 
 
Yes, sir. Thanks for the opportunity. Sir, my ﬁrst quesƟon is regarding just a clariﬁcaƟon that in the 
earlier comment, when sir was highlighƟng that FY25 overall feed consumpƟon can be in the range of 
12 lakh to 13 lakh odd metric tons. And we are guiding FY26 full AvanƟ's feed sales into the range of 
5.75 lakh metric tons. Are we expecƟng a decline in the CY26, considering over 51% market share? 
 
 
C. Ramachandra Rao 
 
No, it's not like that. See, what happens is that whatever the consumpƟon has been there during Q1, 
Q2, Q3, Q4 gradually reduces because of the seasonality. So, what we esƟmate is that it will not be on 
10 
Avanti Feeds Limited         15.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
the same level as in Q1 and Q2. So, that is the reason why we are esƟmaƟng it 5.75, which is 
signiﬁcantly beƩer than last year's consumpƟon and also our sales. 
 
As far as the market share is concerned, deﬁnitely we are above 50%, it is ranging from 51% to 53%, 
that is the range which we are now operaƟng. And I think we will conƟnue to hold that posiƟon at 
52%, 53% in future also. 
 
Ronak Shah 
 
Yes, sir. So, my second quesƟon is regarding how the market is responding because the upcoming 
culƟvaƟon season, which will start from the January end or February. So, what are your senses based 
on the on-ground feedback? How are the farmers taking all this tariﬀ situaƟon? 
 
C. Ramachandra Rao 
 
Yeah. See, it's a good quesƟon because generally the feeling is that the farmers are very much worried 
about this tariﬀ, but the situaƟon is not that. The farmers are very conﬁdent because they have been 
able to get their farm-grade prices comfortably and they are making money and more so, the tariﬀ has 
not really, over a period of Ɵme, slowly the situaƟon is geƫng adjusted to the market correcƟons what 
we can say, see if not the U.S. market, why not other markets. 
 
So, as we explained in our note earlier that we are diversifying into other markets as well as we are 
focusing more on value-added products and also we are going for the domesƟc markets. The 
government is giving support to that. So with all that, the demand for shrimps conƟnues to be growing 
sustainably. It is not that suddenly they'll be dropped. So, that is the reason why we do not see. 
 
We have not seen, rather I would say that in the last maybe six months or so, more than that, where 
since the tariﬀ has come into force, there has not been a big diﬀerence in aƫtude of the farmers, 
though there was a knee-jerk reacƟon on the farmers pretending for a deep fall in the prices and all. 
But that is no longer there. They are very conﬁdent of that and the prices are also good. And we don't 
see, there has not been any fall as far as the aquaculture is concerned, the farmers are preƩy conﬁdent 
of conƟnuing the situaƟon for the next year also, FY26 also. 
 
Ronak Shah 
 
Got it, sir. Sir, my next quesƟon is regarding the diversiﬁcaƟon strategy. So, when we are seeing that 
we are trying to diversify, but when I see our presentaƟon, our saliency for North America was around 
64% in book FY25, which is largely similar or rather increased to 66.9% in book FY26. So, can you 
elaborate on the strategy, how are you seeing that part? 
 
A. Nikhilesh 
 
I'll make that very easy. North America as a country, as we just diversify that way, but the US in general, 
our total share volume is coming down. 
 
 
Ronak Shah 
 
Okay. Got it. And sir, last quesƟon regarding the processing division. So, with the Q2 very solid numbers 
in terms of the 41% plus kind of the growth, but I assume there is some pre shipment considering the 
11 
Avanti Feeds Limited         15.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
tariﬀ situaƟon. Now, when we are seeing around 17,000-odd metric tons target for FY26, are we 
assuming that in this case that the tariﬀ is likely to go out in the fourth quarter of FY26? 
 
A. Nikhilesh 
 
So there was some front loading, but like, the tariﬀ is already out, like, starƟng from April, there were 
mulƟple revisions. The last one coming probably September. So, it's been some Ɵme, but we conƟnue 
to ship across our customers all across the world. And the 17,000, we just made, like, a scenario on 
where we felt we would end. 
 
But frankly, speaking right now, the momentum conƟnues to be strong as it was in the earlier two 
quarters. 
 
Ronak Shah 
 
Okay. And sir, last quesƟon regarding the recent policy which you are highlighƟng. So, can you quanƟfy 
in terms of quantum how it can posiƟvely impact the AvanƟ or the shrimp industry? That's the last 
quesƟon from me. Thank you. 
 
C. Ramachandra Rao 
 
Yeah. This has been announced very recently that they are yet to formulate the mechanism for how 
they would like to give this support, the INR 25,000 crores set apart in the budget for this expenditure. 
And we are expecƟng someƟme in maybe the next couple of months, one or two months, we should 
be able to get, which will be, I think, coincide with the next season, next FY26 that will be helpful for 
us to avail the beneﬁts whatever that is going to be announced by the government. Okay?

Thank you, sir. 
 
Ronak Shah 
 
Yes. Thank you, sir.

So, the next quesƟon comes from Mr . Kamal Sharma, an individual investor. Please go ahead, sir. 
 
Kamal Sharma 
 
Thank you very much, sir. And sir, congratulaƟons on the amazing performance. I have a very quick 
quesƟon. We just heard from the Supreme Court of the U.S., I think they are also reviewing the peƟƟon 
and in case they ﬁnd or declare that the tariﬀs were invalid or illegal, are you going to get any kind of 
refund in that case at all? I mean, if that is the ﬁnal verdict from the US Supreme Court. 
 
C. Ramachandra Rao 
 
Nikhilesh, would you like to take this quesƟon? 
 
A. Nikhilesh 
12 
Avanti Feeds Limited         15.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
 
Yeah. This is quite speculaƟve, to be very frank. So, nobody really knows where this is going. In terms 
of refund, see, as AvanƟ, we've been able to pass on the tariﬀ. So, whether geƫng this refund, I'm not 
sure. I don't think we'll actually get the refund. We have to give it back to the customer, I guess. 
 
C. Ramachandra Rao 
 
Yeah. I can add just that unless these whatever that illegal or whatever is a retrospecƟve eﬀect, it is 
whatever is done already very diﬃcult to arƟculate that. As Nikhilesh said, it's very diﬃcult. It's a 
remote possibility. 
 
A. Nikhilesh 
 
I'll just rephrase my answer. See, it's quite speculaƟve and we need to see what happens because right 
now, there's not enough informaƟon on how it's going to go forward. Once it does, then the 
government, the U.S. Government itself will give direcƟons ﬁrst that we need to go with. So, we need 
to wait and watch. So, it's too early to speculate right now. 
 
Kamal Sharma 
 
Sure. Thank you. 
 
Moderator 
 
Thank you, sir. We have a follow-up quesƟon from Mr . Ronak Shah. Please go ahead, sir. 
 
Ronak Shah 
 
So, my quesƟon is regarding the CVD or the anƟdumping duty. So ﬁrst, I want to know the update on 
what is the current prevailing rate based on the India and the relaƟvely larger compeƟtor? 
 
And the second quesƟon is regarding how we are realigning our costs. So from the numbers, I can see 
that EBITDA per kg has improved signiﬁcantly over the last four-odd quarters, which shows that we 
have passed on certain part of that to the end consumer. So, can you clarify on that part as well? 
 
A. Nikhilesh 
 
Okay. I'll take this quesƟon. So on the ﬁrst point, I think this informaƟon is quite publicly available. 
What are the CVD rates of India versus the of other countries? So a simple Google search or ChatGPT 
can help out on how we ﬁgure and it'll give you the demarcaƟon for ADD and CVD and the total, etc. 
 
Ronak Shah 
 
Sir, my quesƟon is regarding, is there any update? Because the government is likely to review the rate, 
so on that part. 
 
A. Nikhilesh 
 
Yeah. No update right now. There's only a preliminary assessment done, so the ﬁnal review hasn't 
come out yet. 
 
13 
Avanti Feeds Limited         15.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
Ronak Shah 
 
Okay. And from our end, how we are adjusted or passed on to the end consumer, can you highlight 
that? 
 
A. Nikhilesh 
 
So, to the end consumer, the duty itself, 50% is too high, so it's not possible for the supply chain to 
absorb so much percentage. So, essenƟally, we've been able to pass on the cost to the consumer Ɵll 
now. We are just waiƟng and reviewing how it aﬀects the consumpƟon. 
 
Ronak Shah 
 
So sir, just to build up on that, can you highlight how the order process goes on? So, for example, for 
the third quarter on to fourth quarter, whether the US-based customer has placed order? Or if yes, 
then how the pricing has set up? So, the penal and the whole tariﬀ part has been embedded into the 
order cost or how it works? 
 
A. Nikhilesh 
 
Yeah. That's essenƟally how we did it. So, whatever orders we had on our books, and, so we worked 
with our customers to add on the tariﬀ rate. And whatever new orders that we've conﬁrmed since the 
tariﬀ was on the rates that the US government kind of levied. So, that's why we did not like, in general, 
everything that we priced was including the tariﬀs. 
 
Ronak Shah 
 
Okay. Understood.  
 
Moderator 
 
Ronak sir, sorry to interrupt you. Request you to join the queue again for more quesƟons, sir. 
 
Ronak Shah 
 
Just the last quesƟon, if permit. 
 
Moderator 
 
Please go ahead, sir. 
 
Ronak Shah 
 
Yeah. Sir, last quesƟon is regarding our ventures into the ﬁsh and the pet feeder part. So, sir, in terms 
of quanƟtaƟve terms, can you highlight? Because it's been a few quarters since we are evaluaƟng the 
market. Have we got certain feedback on the market or the research reports which you are evaluaƟng? 
What is the market? How large is the market? And how we can posiƟon ourselves? 
 
 
C. Ramachandra Rao 
 
14 
Avanti Feeds Limited         15.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
Yeah. See, the ﬁrst point is our ﬁsh feed because the ﬁsh feed is a bit challenging area because the ﬁsh 
feed prices keep ﬂuctuaƟng and there are diﬀerent species and the feed also diﬀers for each species. 
So, we'll have to keep trying and see the areas which type of ﬁsh is being real cultured. We have to 
give the feed according to that. So, a lot of eﬀorts are being made by imporƟng the feed from Thai 
Union and making trials here to ﬁnd out which suits the Indian market that is number one. 
 
Coming to the pet food, see the pet food is very challenging market and we have started, I would say 
that with a very good beginning because ﬁrst we launched our cat food with the pace which has been 
accepted by the market right from day one. So, we have got a very good response. And as you know 
that these are the products that take Ɵme and there are very strong players, long-term players in this 
like Mars, which is Pedigree and Drools, these players are very strong. And it takes Ɵme for us to really 
build the market and because we are making all eﬀorts that diﬀerent types, so we could do about 
seven months to eight months of cat food. And then later on, we started with dog food and dog food 
has also very good response. 
 
And there are several markeƟng channels that we are now trying to explore each and every one, not 
only the simple distributors, but e-commerce and the diﬀerent types. All those things that we are 
working out on that. And so, we are very conﬁdent that though the iniƟal expenditure is more and we 
will gradually increase the sales volume. And also by the Ɵme we start our manufacturing unit by end 
of FY27, so we should be able to fully have a substanƟal market to our company. And this is a Ɵme-
taking process. I think iniƟally, we'll have to do a lot of work for markeƟng, our products and 
withstanding the compeƟƟon from the long-term players. 
 
Ronak Shah 
 
Thanks a lot for all the answers. 
 
Moderator 
 
Thank you, sir. ParƟcipants are kindly requested to restrict with two quesƟons iniƟally and get back to 
the queue for more quesƟons. 
 
We have another follow-up quesƟon from Mr. Akhilesh Rawat from Ridhanta Vision Private Limited. 
Please go ahead, sir. 
 
Akhilesh Rawat 
 
So, my quesƟon is like as we have seen that ﬁsh meal, SBM and wheat raw material prices are rising 
aŌer quarter one. So, can you quanƟfy the feed margin sensiƟvity, like for every 1 kg increase in key 
raw material prices? So, based on like current raw material level, should we expect like our FY26 feed 
EBIT margins to revert towards historical 10%, 12% or remain closer to H1 levels? 
 
C. Ramachandra Rao 
 
See, it's very diﬃcult to tell for the next Q3 and Q4 because the prices of these raw materials are 
increasing very signiﬁcantly for various reasons. See for example, ﬁsh meal is going up because Peru 
has very less catches this year and even Chile. So, when these countries, Chile and Peru, are the major 
countries supplying the ﬁsh meal, when their producƟon reduces, automaƟcally the global ﬁsh meal 
rate increases and the demand for Indian ﬁsh meal for export increases. So, the Indian ﬁsh meal 
manufacturers prefer to export because they get a beƩer price. For example, the ﬁsh meal, locally 60% 
15 
Avanti Feeds Limited         15.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
protein is being sold at INR 125, INR 130 whereas they are able to get INR 175, INR 160, INR 175 rates 
they are able to get. 
 
Moreover, they get some incenƟves also for exports. They are tempted to export than to supply to the 
domesƟc market. Chile has not yet announced its total quota available for the export. Once it comes, 
I think we are expecƟng that prices get stabilized. It will not be less than about INR 125, INR 130. That 
is the ﬁsh meal situaƟon. 
 
Coming to the soya, soya has two-phased impact. One is that this year because of the excess rains, the 
producƟon has come down by about 10%. So, that is the one reason there is likely to be a slight 
shortage of soya seed producƟon. At the same Ɵme, the government of India has announced increase 
in the minimum support price by about INR 3 per kg. So, these two factors have really inﬂuenced to 
increase the prices to go up. 
 
And parƟcularly the state like Maharashtra, they have made it a mandatory thing for all the soya 
processes to buy from the farmer only at the MSP and they are not allowed to buy less than MSP . So, 
that is the impact. So, we see that soya now for example, the best quality which we use is about INR 
46,500 per metric ton, which was around INR 42,000, INR 43,000, has gone up to INR 46,500. Similarly, 
normal soya as well as high pro, all the prices have gone up and we'll have to see how or now the 
government will start procurement from now on. So, when there is procurement, deﬁnitely the market 
availability, open market availability of soya will be less. 
 
So, when the government procures for their food security, then naturally the prices will go up. So, we 
can expect the next couple of months, the prices will keep on the high side and thereaŌer we'll have 
to see once the government exhausts this quota of purchase, the prices also may likely to stabilize and 
we'll have to wait for that from the maybe around February, March, that's what we are expecƟng. And 
similarly, the soya-dependent market products like soya lecithin will also go along with the price. And 
coming to the wheat ﬂour, the wheat ﬂour also is having the same situaƟon because normally this crop 
comes in the month of February, March. So, we'll have to see. 
 
But as of now, there is a lot of expectaƟon of a high producƟon of wheat this year. But very recently, 
in fact, a couple of days back, the government has in-principle permiƩed 1,000,000 tons of wheat 
products for export. So, Ɵll now it was banned. Wheat and wheat products are banned for export. But 
a couple of days back, the Government of India, the Agricultural Department, has permiƩed in 
principle 1,000,000 tonnes and the Director General of Foreign Trade to prescribe the procedure for 
export of these products. 
 
So as we know, once we start the producƟon exports, then the prices again will go up. So, we are now 
around INR 32,000 to INR 33,000 per metric ton. And we'll have to wait and see what is going to be 
the impact of these export permission given by the Government of India. So cumulaƟvely, we see that 
these things will deﬁnitely increase the price of the raw material cost. But at the same Ɵme, the 
chances of increasing the feed price is not there, it's very remote. Generally, it's not possible to 
increase the price of the feed. 
 
So, the margins are naturally likely to come down to maybe around it to be 9% and 10%. So, 10% is a 
good achievable proﬁtability for this current year overall. Now, that Ɵll now we have been doing very 
well, but we'll have to see the next two quarters and see how the proﬁtability will be depending upon 
the raw material prices.
