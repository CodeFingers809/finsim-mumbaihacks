Independent Auditor's Limited Review Report on Unaudited Half Year Ended & Quarterly

Limited Pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (listing Obligations and Disclosure
Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended.
Review Report to
The Board of Directors,
Alfavision Overseas (India) Limited
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited standalone financial
results of Alfavision Overseas (India) Limited (the "Company") for the quarter ended
and the Half Year Ended September 30, 2025(the "Statement") attached herewith,
being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of
the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as
amended (the "Listing Regulations").
2. The Company's Management is responsible for the preparation of the Statement in
accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian
Accounting Standard 34, (Ind AS 34) "Interim Financial Reporting" prescribed under
Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 as amended, read with relevant rules issued .
thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and in
compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. The Statement has been
approved by the Company's Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to express a
conclusion on the Statement based on our review.
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on
of Interim Financial Information"Review(SRE) 2410,Review Engagements
Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform the
re .view to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the Statement is free of material
misstatement. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries,
primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying
analytical and other review procedures. A review is.substantially less in scope than
an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does
not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit '
opinion.

the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian
Accounting Standards ('lnd AS') specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act,
2013 as amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting
principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to
be disclosed in terms of the Listing Regulations, including the manner in which it is to
be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
