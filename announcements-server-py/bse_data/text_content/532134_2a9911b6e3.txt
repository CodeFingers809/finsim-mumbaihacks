	for	the	List
of	Affected	Credit	Ratings.	This	list	is	an	integral	part	of	this	Press	Release	and	identifies	each	affected	issuer.
RATINGS	RATIONALE
Our	updated	Banks	methodology	maintains	our	overall	methodological	approach,	but	we	have	made	a	number
of	changes	to	the	BCA	framework.	These	include	changes	to	certain	metrics	or	sources	of	metrics	and	the
recalibration	of	thresholds	for	the	Credit	Conditions	factor	of	the	Macro	Profile,	as	well	as	updated	ratio
definitions	and	scoring	calibrations	for	the	Capital,	Funding	Structure	and	Liquid	Resources	subfactors	of	the
Financial	Profile.	Further,	we	have	added	and	refined	our	adjustments	to	the	Macro	Profile	factor	scores	and	the
Financial	Profile	subfactor	scores.	We	have	also	provided	more	clarity	on	how	we	apply	Qualitative	Adjustments
notching	for	outsized	risks	that	we	might	not	otherwise	fully	capture	in	the	Financial	Profile.
Additionally,	we	have	simplified	the	presentation	of	our	framework	for	the	additional	notching	component	of
instrument	ratings	to	reflect	features	that	could	affect	expected	loss	but	that	are	not	always	related	to	failure,	and
we	adopted	a	principles-based	approach	to	applying	scenario	analysis	and	stress	testing	in	our	forward-looking
assessment	of	a	bank's	credit	quality.
For	each	bank	included	in	today's	action,	unless	the	narrative	below	updates	our	view	on	a	particular	rating
component,	sub-component,	factor	or	sub-factor,	or	rating	outlook,	these	considerations	are	unchanged.
ENTITY-SPECIFIC	CONSIDERATIONS
--	DBS	Group	Holdings	Ltd	(DBSH)	and	DBS	Bank	Ltd.	(DBS)
The	affirmation	of	all	ratings	and	assessments	of	DBSH	and	its	main	operating	entity	DBS	reflects	our	updated
ratio	definitions	and	scoring	calibrations	for	the	Capital,	Funding	Structure	and	Liquid	Resources	subfactors,	and
our	assessment	that	the	group's	significant	business	and	geographical	diversification	enhances	its	financial
stability	through	credit	cycles.
--	Oversea-Chinese	Banking	Corporation	Limited	(OCBC)
The	affirmation	of	all	ratings	and	assessments	of	OCBC	reflects	our	updated	ratio	definitions	and	scoring

--	United	Overseas	Bank	Limited	(UOB)
The	affirmation	of	all	ratings	and	assessments	of	UOB	reflects	our	updated	ratio	definitions	and	scoring
calibrations	for	the	Capital,	Funding	Structure	and	Liquid	Resources	subfactors,	and	our	assessment	that	the
bank's	significant	business	and	geographical	diversification	enhances	its	financial	stability	through	credit	cycles.
--	Punjab	National	Bank	(PNB)
The	affirmation	of	PNB's	Baa3	ratings	reflects	our	expectation	of	a	very	high	probability	of	support	from	the
Government	of	India	(Baa3	stable)	in	times	of	need,	which	results	in	one-notch	uplift	to	its	Baa3	ratings	from	its
ba1	BCA.	The	upgrade	of	PNB's	BCA	and	adjusted	BCA	reflects	the	updated	ratio	definition	and	scoring
calibration	for	the	Capital	subfactor,	and	improvement	in	its	asset	quality,	capital	and	profitability.
--	Bank	of	Baroda	(BOB)
The	affirmation	of	BOB's	Baa3	ratings	reflects	our	expectation	of	a	very	high	probability	of	support	from	the
Government	of	India	(Baa3	stable)	in	times	of	need,	which	results	in	one-notch	uplift	to	its	Baa3	ratings	from	its
ba1	BCA.	The	upgrade	of	BOB's	BCA	and	adjusted	BCA	reflects	the	updated	ratio	definition	and	scoring
calibration	for	the	Capital	subfactor,	and	improvements	in	its	asset	quality	and	capitalization.
--	Canara	Bank	(Canara)
The	affirmation	of	Canara's	Baa3	ratings	reflects	our	expectation	of	a	very	high	probability	of	support	from	the
Government	of	India	(Baa3	stable)	in	times	of	need,	which	results	in	one-notch	uplift	in	its	Baa3	ratings	from	its
ba1	BCA.	The	upgrade	of	Canara's	BCA	and	adjusted	BCA	reflects	the	updated	ratio	definition	and	scoring
calibration	for	the	Capital	subfactor,	and	improvement	in	its	asset	quality	and	capitalization.
--	Saigon	Thuong	Tin	Commercial	Joint-Stock	Bank	(Sacombank)
The	upgrade	of	Sacombank's	long-term	ratings	and	BCA	reflects	the	updated	ratio	definition	and	scoring
calibration	for	the	Capital	subfactor,	and	our	view	that	the	bank	is	effectively	navigating	its	financial	restructuring
program,	which	has	resulted	in	stronger	capital	and	profitability.
--	Fortune	Vietnam	Joint	Stock	Commercial	Bank	(LPBank)
The	upgrade	of	LPBank's	long-term	deposit	and	issuer	ratings	and	BCA	reflects	the	updated	ratio	and	scoring
calibration	for	the	Funding	Structure	subfactor	as	the	bank	reduces	its	reliance	on	short-term	borrowings.	The
bank	also	benefits	from	its	wide	transaction	network.
--	Vietnam	Maritime	Commercial	Joint	Stock	Bank	(MSB)
The	upgrade	of	MSB's	long-term	deposit	and	issuer	ratings	and	BCA	reflects	the	updated	ratio	definition	and
scoring	calibration	for	the	Capital	subfactor,	and	the	bank's	above	peer-average	stock	of	high-quality	liquid
assets.
--	Affin	Bank	Berhad	(Affin	Bank)
The	upgrade	of	Affin	Bank's	BCA	and	Adjusted	BCA	reflects	the	updated	ratio	definition	and	scoring	calibration
for	the	Capital	subfactor.	The	action	also	reflects	the	bank's	improved	funding	profile.	The	ratings	affirmation	is
driven	by	our	expectation	that	the	bank	will	maintain	stable	credit	fundamentals	and	will	benefit	from	support
from	the	State	of	Sarawak	(A3	stable)	in	case	of	need.
--	PT	Bank	CIMB	Niaga	Tbk	(CIMB	Niaga)
The	affirmation	of	all	CIMB	Niaga's	ratings	and	BCA	reflects	the	updated	ratio	definitions	and	scoring
calibrations	of	the	Capital	and	Funding	subfactors,	with	the	latter	driven	by	the	high	stability	of	deposits	due	to
Indonesia's	high	deposit	insurance	coverage.
--	P.T.	Bank	Danamon	Indonesia	TBK	(Bank	Danamon)
The	affirmation	of	all	Bank	Danamon's	ratings	and	BCA	reflects	its	ample	level	of	liquidity	and	the	updated	ratio
definition	and	scoring	calibration	for	the	Funding	subfactor,	which	is	driven	by	the	high	stability	of	deposits	due	to
Indonesia's	high	deposit	insurance	coverage.
FACTORS	THAT	COULD	LEAD	TO	AN	UPGRADE	OR	DOWNGRADE	OF	THE	RATINGS
For	each	bank	included	in	today's	action,	an	improvement	in	the	entity's	creditworthiness	could	lead	to	an
upgrade,	where	relevant,	of	long-term	deposit,	issuer	and	senior	unsecured	debt	ratings.
For	each	bank	included	in	today's	action,	a	deterioration	in	the	entity's	creditworthiness	could	lead	to	a
downgrade,	where	relevant,	of	long-term	deposit,	issuer	and	senior	unsecured	debt	ratings.
Furthermore,	the	following	considerations,	specific	to	individual	entities,	could	lead	to	an	upgrade	or	downgrade
of	ratings.	Unless	these	considerations	differ	from	our	previous	view	of	a	particular	factor,	they	are	incremental
to	our	previous	rating	action	press	releases	pertaining	to	that	bank.
ENTITY-SPECIFIC	CONSIDERATIONS
--	DBS	Group	Holdings	Ltd	(DBSH)	and	DBS	Bank	Ltd.	(DBS)
We	could	downgrade	DBS's	BCA	and	ratings	if	the	group's	problem	loans	ratio	exceeds	2.0%,	its	TCE/RWA
ratio	falls	to	below	14.5%,	and	its	net	income/tangible	assets	ratio	decreases	to	below	1.3%.	In	addition,	we
would	downgrade	DBSH's	ratings	if	DBS's	ratings	are	downgraded.
--	Oversea-Chinese	Banking	Corporation	Limited	(OCBC)
We	could	downgrade	OCBC's	BCA	and	ratings	if	the	bank's	problem	loans	ratio	exceeds	3.0%,	or	if	its
TCE/RWA	ratio	falls	to	below	14.5%,	or	if	its	net	income/tangible	assets	ratio	decreases	to	below	0.8%.
--	United	Overseas	Bank	Limited	(UOB)
We	could	downgrade	UOB's	BCA	and	ratings	if	the	bank's	problem	loans	ratio	exceeds	3.0%,	or	if	its	TCE/RWA
ratio	falls	to	below	14.5%,	or	if	its	net	income/tangible	assets	ratio	declines	to	below	0.8%.
--	Punjab	National	Bank	(PNB)
We	could	upgrade	PNB's	BCA	if	its	TCE/RWA	ratio	improves	to	above	14%	and	its	net	income/tangible	assets
ratio	increases	to	above	1.3%	on	a	sustained	basis,	while	other	credit	fundamentals	remain	unchanged.
We	could	downgrade	PNB's	ratings	if	India's	sovereign	rating	is	downgraded	or	if	there	is	a	multi-notch
downgrade	of	the	bank's	BCA.	The	BCA	could	be	downgraded	if	the	banks'	loan	growth	accelerates	to	a	level
materially	higher	than	system	loan	growth,	posing	risks	to	asset	quality,	or	if	the	banks	TCE/RWA	ratio	declines
to	below	10.5%	or	its	net	income/tangible	assets	ratio	declines	to	below	0.5%	on	a	sustained	basis.
--	Bank	of	Baroda	(BOB)
We	could	upgrade	BOB's	BCA	if	its	TCE/	RWA	ratio	improves	to	above	14%	and	its	net	income/tangible	assets
ratio	increases	to	above	1.3%	on	a	sustained	basis,	while	other	credit	fundamentals	remain	unchanged.
We	could	downgrade	BOB's	ratings	if	India's	sovereign	rating	is	downgraded	or	if	there	is	a	multi-notch
downgrade	of	the	bank's	BCA.	The	BCA	could	be	downgraded	if	the	banks'	loan	growth	accelerates	to	a	level
materially	higher	than	system	loan	growth,	posing	risks	to	asset	quality,	or	if	the	banks	TCE/RWA	ratio	declines
to	below	10.5%	or	its	net	income/tangible	assets	ratio	declines	to	below	0.5%	on	a	sustained	basis.
--	Canara	Bank	(Canara)
We	could	upgrade	Canara's	BCA	if	its	TCE/RWA	ratio	improves	to	above	14%	and	its	net	income/tangible
assets	ratio	increases	to	above	1.3%	on	a	sustained	basis,	while	other	credit	fundamentals	remain	unchanged.
We	could	downgrade	Canara's	ratings	if	India's	sovereign	rating	is	downgraded	or	if	there	is	a	multi-notch
downgrade	of	the	bank's	BCA.	The	BCA	could	be	downgraded	if	the	banks'	loan	growth	accelerates	to	a	level
materially	higher	than	system	loan	growth,	posing	risks	to	asset	quality,	or	if	the	banks	TCE/RWA	ratio	declines
to	below	10.5%	or	its	net	income/tangible	assets	ratio	declines	to	below	0.5%	on	a	sustained	basis.
--	Saigon	Thuong	Tin	Commercial	Joint-Stock	Bank	(Sacombank)
We	could	further	upgrade	Sacombank's	long-term	ratings	and	BCA	if	the	bank	maintains	its	problem	loans	ratio,
excluding	legacy	problem	assets,	at	around	1.5%-2.0%	and	its	TCE/RWA	ratio	improves	to	above	10%	on	a
sustained	basis.
We	could	downgrade	Sacombank's	ratings	and	BCA	if	the	bank's	funding	structure	deteriorates.	A	decline	in	its
TCE/RWA	ratio	to	below	8%,	as	well	as	a	weakening	in	its	funding	and	liquidity,	will	be	negative	for	the	BCA.
--	Fortune	Vietnam	Joint	Stock	Commercial	Bank	(LPBank)
We	could	upgrade	LPBank's	BCA	if	its	TCE/RWA	ratio	improves	above	13.5%	and	the	bank	lowers	its	reliance
on	market	funds	with	its	less-stable	funds/tangible	banking	assets	ratio	declining	below	25%.
We	could	downgrade	LPBank's	ratings	and	BCA	if	its	problem	loans	ratio	increases	above	3%,	leading	to	higher
credit	costs	and	a	decline	in	net	income/tangible	assets	ratio	to	below	0.8%,	or	if	the	TCE/RWA	ratio	declines
below	8%.	A	weakening	in	LPBank's	funding	and	liquidity	will	also	be	negative	for	the	bank's	BCA.
--	Vietnam	Maritime	Commercial	Joint	Stock	Bank	(MSB)
We	could	upgrade	MSB's	BCA	if	it	(1)	reduces	the	stock	of	problematic	assets	and	strengthens	its	provision
coverage,	(2)	maintains	its	TCE/RWA	ratio	above	13.5%	and	(3)	lowers	its	reliance	on	less	stable	funds	to	less
than	25%	of	tangible	banking	assets	on	a	sustained	basis,	with	other	credit	fundamentals	remaining	unchanged.
We	could	downgrade	MSB's	ratings	and	BCA	if	the	bank's	TCE/RWA	ratio	declines	to	below	11%	and	its	net
income/tangible	assets	ratio	declines	to	below	1%.	A	weakening	in	MSB's	funding	and	liquidity	will	also	be
negative	for	the	BCA.
--	Affin	Bank	Berhad	(Affin	Bank)
The	BCA	could	be	upgraded	following	significant	improvements	in	recurring	profitability,	while	other	credit
fundamentals	remain	unchanged.
We	could	downgrade	Affin	Bank's	BCA	if	its	(1)	high	quality	liquid	assets	decline	to	below	17%	of	tangible
banking	assets,	or	(2)	less-stable	funds/tangible	banking	assets	ratio	increasing	significantly	to	above	23%.	Only
a	multi-notch	BCA	downgrade	would	lead	to	lower	deposit	and	senior	unsecured	ratings.
--	PT	Bank	CIMB	Niaga	Tbk	(CIMB	Niaga)
We	could	upgrade	CIMB	Niaga's	BCA	if	there	is	a	significant	strengthening	of	its	franchise,	and	improvements	in
its	asset	quality,	profitability	and	capital	metrics.
We	could	downgrade	CIMB	Niaga's	BCA	and	ratings	if	its	credit	metrics	deteriorate	significantly,	whereby	its
problem	loans	ratio	increases	to	above	8%,	its	TCE/RWA	ratio	decreases	to	below	14.5%,	and	net
income/tangible	assets	ratio	decreases	to	below	1.3%	on	a	sustained	basis.
--	P.T.	Bank	Danamon	Indonesia	TBK	(Bank	Danamon)
We	could	upgrade	the	bank's	BCA	and	ratings	if	there	is	a	significant	strengthening	of	its	franchise	and
improvements	in	its	credit	metrics,	including	asset	quality,	profitability,	funding	and	liquidity.
We	could	downgrade	the	bank's	BCA	if	its	Stage	3	loans	ratio	exceeds	5%,	leading	to	its	TCE/RWA	ratio	falling
below	16%.	A	depletion	of	the	bank's	high-quality	liquid	assets	will	also	be	negative	for	the	ratings.
PRINCIPAL	METHODOLOGY
The	principal	methodology	used	in	these	ratings	was	Banks	published	in	November	2025	and	available	at
https://ratings.moodys.com/rmc-documents/454566
.	Alternatively,	please	see	the	Rating	Methodologies	page	on
https://ratings.moodys.com
	for	a	copy	of	this	methodology.
UOB's	"Assigned	BCA"	of	a1	is	set	two	notches	above	the	"Financial	Profile"	initial	score	of	a3	to	reflect	the
bank's	conservative	risk	culture	and	highly	diversified	franchise	that	are	not	adequately	captured	by	the
subfactor	scores.
BOB's	"Assigned	BCA"	of	ba1	is	set	two	notches	below	the	"Financial	Profile"	initial	score	of	baa2	to	reflect	the
bank's	high	single-name	borrower	concentration	risk,	unseasoned	risks	due	to	its	rapid	expansion	in	the	retail
lending	and	modest	track	record	of	managing	asset	quality	and	profitability	across	credit	cycles.
Canara's	"Assigned	BCA"	of	ba1	is	set	two	notches	below	the	"Financial	Profile"	initial	score	of	baa2	to	reflect
the	bank's	high	single-name	borrower	concentration	risk,	unseasoned	risks	due	to	its	rapid	expansion	in	the
retail	lending	and	modest	track	record	of	managing	asset	quality	and	profitability	during	across	credit	cycles.
CIMB	Niaga's	"Assigned	BCA"	of	baa3	is	set	two	notches	below	the	"Financial	Profile"	initial	score	of	baa1	to
reflect	the	risks	arising	from	restructured	loans,	and	unseasoned	loan	risks	from	its	expansion	into	the	retail	and
SME	segments	in	second-tier	cities	across	Indonesia.
For	DBSH,	OCBC,	PNB,	Sacombank,	LPBank,	MSB,	Affin	Bank	and	Bank	Danamon,	the	net	effect	of	any
adjustments	applied	to	rating	factor	scores	or	scorecard	outputs	under	the	primary	methodology(ies),	if	any,	was
not	material	to	the	ratings	addressed	in	this	announcement.
