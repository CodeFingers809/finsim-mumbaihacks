1. The above unaudited Consolidated Financial Results were reviewed and recommended by the Audit 
Committee and approved by the Board of Directors of the Holding Company at the meeting held on 
18/11/2025. The Statutory Auditors have carried out the limited review of the Unaudited Consolidated 
Financial Results forthe quarter and half year ended September 30,2025 vide their report dated 18/11/2025. 
2. This result has been prepared in accordance with Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosures 
Requirement) Regulation, 2015. The material accounting policies applied in preparation of these financial 
results are consistent with those followed in the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
March 31, 2025. 
3. Specific notes related with Subsidiary Companies: 
a) Valecha l M Toll Private limited (VlMTPl) 
The Hon'ble National Company Law Tribuna" Mumbai Bench, has passed its order on 03.11.2025 for 
the dissolution of Valecha LM Toll Private Limited, an erstwhile step down subsidiary of the Holding 
Company, under Section 54 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. The company shall be 
considered dissolved with effect from the date of the order i.e. 03.11.2025. The Liquidator has 
accordingly demitted office and shall proceed to serve a copy of the dissolution order to the Registrar 
of Companies for its record. 
Accordingly, Valecha Infrastructure Limited (VILL Parent Company of VLMTPL, has written off 
investment in equity shares of VLMTPL Rs.7.40 Crores and investment in Compulsory Convertible 
Debentures (CCD) of VLMTPL Rs. 37.31 Crores, aggregating to Rs.44.71 Crores, which were already 
provided for in earlier years. The amount such written off and provision written back since no longer 
required, has been shown under "Exceptionalltems (Net) [gain/{Loss)]" 
b) Valecha Reality limited (VRl) 
i. VRL has given a loan amounting to Rs 6.51 crores to M/s SVK Arcade LLP which is long outstanding in 
the Books of Accounts. VRL is not recognizing & receiving any interest on such loan and has neither 
made any provision for the loan amount outstanding. 
ii. VRL has received loans from Valecha Engineering Limited (liVELli) and Valecha Infrastructure Ltd ("VILli) 
to the tune of Rs. 0.28 crores and Rs. 6.52 crores respectively. VRL has not paid any interest on the 
same nor has it made any provisioning of the interest payable. VEL has not recovered any interest in 
view of already weak financial position of VRL. Similarly, VIL has also not recovered any interest 
amount from VRL in view of already weak financial position of VRL. 
iii. The subsidiary company, Valecha Realty Limited, has not accounted for its investment in Valecha 
Power Limited using the equity method as required under Ind AS 28 -Investments in Associates and 
Joint Ventures. Instead, the investment has been carried at cost. Management believes that this 
presentation is appropriate under the circumstances. The possible impact, if any, of this accounting 
treatment on the unaudited consolidated financial results has not been determined.

In view ofthe above fact that the Resolution plan is yet to be approved by NCLT and moreover, as per 
provisions of IBC, 2016, the company is to be kept as a going concern, and hence unaudited financial 
results are prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern. 
ii. The Resolution plan is yet to be approved by NCLT due to which, the Ind AS 109 - Financial Instruments 
compliance relating to the recognition and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities is not yet 
done. Consequently, the impact, if any, arising from such recognition and derecognition has not been 
determined or given effect in the financial results. The same will be considered and accounted for 
upon conclusion ofthe CIRP and final approval ofthe Resolution Plan by the Hon'ble NCLT

which has not been tested for impairment, despite the continued losses and sub-optimal operations of the 
Group. In accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 36 (Impairment of Assets), goodwill is subject to 
annual impairment testing or more frequently when indicators of impairment exist. However, no such testing 
has been carried out during the reporting period.

the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025, arising from the non-recognition of impairment on 
goodwill, cannot be determined at this stage. The company will perform the required impairment testing 
in compliance with Ind AS 36 in due course .

Independent Auditors' Review Report on Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results of V~lecha 
Engineering Limited for the quarter and half year ended 30th September, 2025 pursuant to RegulatIOIl 33 
of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 as amended. 
To 
The Bo.ard of Directors, 
Valecha Engineering Limited 
L We h<lve reviewed the accompanying statement of consolidated unaudited financial results of Valec.ha 
Engineering Limited (hereinafter referred to as the "Holding Company") and its subsidiaries and associate.? 
(the Holding Comp<lny, its subsidiaries and its associates together referred to as "the Group") for the quarter 
and half year ended September 3D, 2025 and for the petiod from April 2025 to September 2025 ("the 
Statement"), being submitted by the Parent pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the SEB! 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended. 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Parent's Management and approved by the Parent's 
Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles 
laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" ("Ind AS 34"), prescribed 
under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and other accounttng principles generally accepted in 
India. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statementbased on our review . 
3. We conducted bur teview of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements 
(SRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the 
Entity", issued by the InstiLute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial 
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting 
matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope 
than an audit cOll,ducted in accQrdancewith St81i.dards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us 
to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an 
audit. Accordingly, we do not express 811 audit opinion. 
We also performed procedures in accordance "\lith the circular issued by the SEBI under Regulation 33 
(8) of the SEB! (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Reguladons, 2015, as amended, to th e 
extent applicable.

5. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above and based on 
the consideration of the review reports of the other auditors referred to in paragraph 7 below, nothing 
has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in 
accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian 
Accounting Standard and other accounting principles generally accepted in' India, has not disclosed the 
information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEEr (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended, ilic1uding the maImer in which it is to be 
disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
