EFFORTS TO MODERNISE THE SOURCING OF ECONOMIC DATA 
MoSPI rolls out system for 
tracking emerging industries FE BUREAU 
New Delhi, November 18 
AS PART OF efforts to widen 
and modernise the sourcing of 
economic data, the Ministry of 
Statistics and Programme 
Implementation (MoSPI) on 
Tuesday unveiled the National 
Industrial Classification (NIC) 
2025 — a comprehensive over- 
haulaimedat capturing emerg- 
ing industries such as digital 
platforms, renewable energy, 
and intermediation services. 
The updated classification 
aligns with the International 
Standard Industrial Classifica- 
tion of All Economic Activities 
(ISIC) Revision 5 developed by 
the United Nations Statistics 
Division and has been prepared 
by the National Statistics Office 
(NSO) to categorise activities 
across industries more precisely. 
Akey feature of NIC 2025 is 
the introduction of a six-digit 
India-specificcodingstructure, 
replacingthe existing five-digit 
system. The new framework

ronmental and green economy

According to MoSPI, “cloud 
infrastructure,blockchain, plat-

search portalsaredistinctly clas- 
sified, reflecting the evolving 
nature of the digital economy.” 
The ministry said the NIC 
will serve as a vital statistical 
standard for compiling and 
analysing economic indicators 
acrosssectors.“New classeshave 
been created across multiple 
sections to reflect the growing 
role of intermediaries in sectors 
such as power, retail, logistics, 
healthcare, education, real 
estate, and food services,” it 
added. The latest classification 
expands to Sections Ato V (pre- 
viouslyA to U),with several sec- 
tionsreorganised to reflect new 
economicrealities. Forinstance, 
digital and IT services are now 
divided across Sections J and K, 
while repairand intermediation 
serviceshavebeen placed innew

Moscow, November 18 
INDIA ON TUESDAY said that 
the world must display “zero 
tolerance”towards terrorismin 
all its forms and manifesta- 
tions, asserting that there can 
be no justification, no looking 
away and “no whitewashing”. 
“AsIndiahasdemonstrated, 
wehave therightto defend our 
people against terrorism, and 
will exerciseit,” External Affairs 
Minister S Jaishankarsaid in his 
address at the Shanghai Coop- 
eration Organisation (SCO) 
Council of Heads of Govern- 
ment meeting. Jaishankar said 
India believes that the SCO 
must “adapt to the changing 
global landscape, develop an 
expanded agenda, and reform 
its working methods”. “We will 
contribute positively and fully 
to these objectives,” he said. 
The SCO was founded at a 
summit in Shanghaiin 2001 
by the presidents of Russia, 
China, the Kyrgyz Republic, 
Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and 
Uzbekistan. 
India and Pakistan became 
its permanent members in 
2017.InJuly2023,Iranbecame 
the newpermanent member of 
the SCO at an India-hosted vir- 
tual summit of the grouping. 
“We must never forget that 
the SCO was founded to com- 
batthe three evils of terrorism, 
separatism and extremism. 
These threats have become 
even more serious in the years 
that have passed,”he said.

Duringthesearches,the ED

Falah University has been 
under scrutiny following the 
busting of a “white-collar” ter- 
ror module and the November 
10 blast near the Red Fort, 
which claimed 15 lives. 
The ED investigation is 
based on two FIRs registered 
by the Delhi Police, alleging 
that Al Falah University falsely 
and UGC recognition under 
Section 12(B) to mislead stu- 
dents and parents. The UGC 
has clarified that the univer-

including the routing of funds
