Independent Auditor’s Review Report on Unaudited Standalone Quarterly Financial Results and        
Year-to-Date Financial Results of the Company pursuant to the Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read 
with Regulation 63 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as 
amended) 
   
 
To the Board of Directors of The Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation Limited  
 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited standalone financial results (‘the Statement’) 
of The Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation Limited (‘the Company’) for the quarter ended 30 September 
2025 and the Year-to-Date financial results for the period 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025, being submitted 
by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63 
of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) (‘Listing 
Regulations’) read with SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/DDHS/PoD1/P/CIR/2024/54 dated 22 May 2024.  
 
2. The Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company’s management and approved by the Company’s 
Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid 
down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting (‘Ind AS 34’), prescribed under section 
133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’), and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and 
is in compliance with the presentation and disclosure requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read 
with Regulation 63 of the Listing Regulations. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement 
based on our review. 
 
 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 
2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists of making 
inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and 
other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with 
the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act, and consequently, does not enable 
us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an 
audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that 
the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid 
down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under section 133 of the Act, and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in accordance with the 
requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63 of the Listing Regulations, 
including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.

# The Corporation has recognised an exceptional gain on the transfer of equity shares held in The Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing Company Limited (an associate company) to
Baymanco Investments Limited (a wholly owned step-down subsidiary) on 03 June 2025. On account of this transaction, there is no change in total group holding and the investee
continues to be classified as an associate company. 
Further the Board of Directors has also approved to enter into an agreement with MSTC limited for availing the e-auction services for the identification of potential buyer(s) for
monetization of certain assets in the plantations business situated at Tamil Nadu, which have been classified as assets held for sale as at 30 September 2025. 
The above assets meet the criteria laid down under Indian Accounting Standard 105, "Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations". There is no requirement to
recognise impairment loss as the estimated fair values of these assets are higher than their carrying value.
(a) Debt equity ratio = Debt / Net worth 
      [Debt: Non-current borrowings + current borrowings + lease liabilities]
      [Net worth: Paid-up equity share capital + other equity]
(b) Debt service coverage ratio = Earnings before finance cost, depreciation and amortisation expense, exceptional items and tax  
     ('EBITDA') / (Finance cost + Principal repayment made of long-term debt for the period/year)
(c) Interest service coverage ratio = EBITDA / Finance cost
(d) Current ratio = Current assets / Current liabilities 
(e) Long term debt to working capital = Long term debt / Net working capital
     [Long term debt: Non-current borrowings + current maturity of long term debt + non-current lease liabilities]
     [Net working capital: Current assets - Current liabilities (including current maturities of long term debt)]
(f) Current liability ratio = Current liabilities / Total liabilities
(g) Total debt to total assets = [Non-current borrowings + current borowings + lease liabilities] / Total assets
(h) Debtors turnover = Annualised revenue from operations / Average trade receivables 
(i) Inventory turnover = Annualised cost of goods sold / Average inventory
    [Cost of goods sold: Cost of material consumed + Purchases of stock-in-trade + Changes in inventories of finished goods,  
    stock-in-trade and work-in-progress] 
(j) Operating margin = [EBITDA - Other income] / Revenue from operations
(k) Net profit margin = Profit after tax / Revenue from operations
(l) Bad debt to accounts receivable ratio = Bad debts /Average trade receivables
The Corporation has opted to present data related to its segments in the consolidated financial results, in accordance with Ind AS 108 “Operating Segments”. No disclosures
regarding segments are therefore presented in these standalone financial results.
The figures for the previous year have been regrouped/recast/rearranged to render them comparable with the figures of the current period/year.

Independent Auditor’s Review Report on Unaudited Consolidated Quarterly Financial Results and 
Year-to-Date Financial Results of the Company pursuant to the Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read 
with Regulation 63 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 
(as amended) 
 
To the Board of Directors of The Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation Limited  
 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited consolidated financial results (the 
‘Statement’) of The Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation Limited  (the ‘Holding Company’) and its 
subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the ‘Group’), its associates 
and joint venture (refer Annexure 1 for the list of subsidiaries, associates and joint venture included in the 
Statement) for the quarter ended 30 September 2025 and the consolidated year-to-date financial results 
for the period 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025, being submitted by the Holding Company pursuant to 
the requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63 of the SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) (‘Listing Regulations’), read 
with SEBI circular SEBI/HO/DDHS/PoD1/P/CIR/2024/54 dated 22 May 2024. 
  
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Holding Company’s management and approved by the 
Holding Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting (‘Ind AS 
34’), prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the ‘Act’), and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India and is in compliance with the presentation and disclosure requirements of 
Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63 of the Listing Regulations. Our responsibility is 
to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements 
(SRE) 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’). A review of interim financial information 
consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and 
applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit 
conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act, and 
consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant 
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
 
We also performed procedures in accordance with the circular issued by SEBI under Regulation 33 (8) of 
the Listing Regulation, to the extent applicable.

4. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above and upon 
consideration of the review reports of the other auditors/independent chartered accountants referred to in 
paragraph 6 below, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying 
Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 
34, prescribed under section 133 of the Act, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in accordance with the requirements of 
Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63 of the Listing Regulations, including the manner 
in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement. 
 
5. We invite attention to the matter described in Note 4 to the Statement and the following Emphasis of Matter 
paragraph included in review report on the special purpose consolidated financial results of The Bombay 
Dyeing and Manufacturing Company Limited (“BDMC”), an associate of the Group, reviewed by their 
respective auditor, vide their review report dated 6 November 2025 which is largely reproduced by us 
below; 
 
“We draw attention to Note 4 to the Statement which describes the matter relating to the Order dated 21 
October 2022, issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”), imposing, inter alia, 
penalties of ₹ 2.25 crore on the associate as also restraining the associate from accessing the securities 
market for a period of two years. As informed, the associate has filed an appeal before the Securities 
Appellate Tribunal (SAT) against the said Order of the SEBI, and SAT has stayed the effect and operation 
of the said Order on 10 November 2022. Since then, the matter before SAT is heard and Order is reserved. 
Thus, in the given circumstances, considering the present status of uncertainty related to the matters 
arising out of the SEBI Order and grant of stay by SAT for the effect and operation of the said Order, impact 
of this matter has not been given in these unaudited consolidated financial results of the associate. 
 
Our conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter.”

Further, of these subsidiaries and associates, two subsidiaries are located outside India, whose interim

financial information of such subsidiaries from accounting principles generally accepted in their respective 
countries to accounting principles generally accepted in India. We have reviewed these conversion 
adjustments made by the Holding Company’s management. Our conclusion, in so far as it relates to the
