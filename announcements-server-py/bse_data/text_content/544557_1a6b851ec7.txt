Management Commentary
Commenting on the performance Mr. Ramkumar Senthilvel, Managing Director said:
“The second quarter of FY2026 reflects a stable performance in a changing trade environment. Despite market-wide pressure on freight 
rates and a moderation in global shipment movement, the company continued to build on its growth strategy, focusing on strengthening 
core business segments, enhancing customer engagement and capturing emerging opportunities across trade lanes.
Revenue from Operations was Rs. 2,147 million during Q2 FY26, lower by 25.2% YoY on account of softer demand and price normalization 
in the freight industry. However, revenue improved meaningfully on a sequential basis, increasing 27.7% over Q1 FY26, driven by improved 
realisations across key routes. Sea Import remained the primary business vertical, contributing nearly 81% to quarterly revenue and 
continuing to be the cornerstone of operations.
Air segment performance was encouraging, supported by broad-based growth across both imports and exports. Air Import revenue 
increased 17.3% YoY and its share of total revenue rose to 2.11% in Q2 FY26 from 1.34% in Q2 FY25. Air Export also gained momentum, 
with revenue growing more than doubling 2x YoY, increasing its contribution to 0.66% in Q2 FY26 from 0.22% in Q2 FY25. The steady scale-
up in air freight indicates increasing acceptance of Glottis as a multi-modal logistics partner, backed by an expanding network across 
global gateways.
Profitability remained steady in line with business momentum. EBITDA for the quarter was Rs. 181 million with a margin of 8.4% whereas 
Profit After Tax was Rs. 124 million with a margin of 5.8%.
On the operational front the company handled 21,972 TEUs during Q2 FY26. Although TEU handling moderated, customer traction 
improved with deeper wallet share gains among strategic accounts. Revenue contribution from the top 5 customers increased to 41% in 
Q2 FY26 from 39% in Q1 FY26, reflecting stronger customer stickiness and a higher share of business from long-standing relationships.
From a geographic standpoint, Asia remained the dominant region, contributing 86% to revenue in Q2 and 84% during H1 FY26. Region-
wise demand trends remained favorable in sectors such as renewable energy, where the share of revenue improved to 46% in Q2 from 
43% in Q1, supported by sustained global capacity expansion in the clean energy value chain and rising import flows into India.
Overall, the performance in the first half of FY2026 shows the company’s ability to sustain growth while adapting to shifts in the global 
logistics cycle. The focus going ahead remains on expanding service capabilities across both sea and air segments, deepening customer 
relationships, and leveraging our presence across high-growth end-industries and trade lanes. With continued strengthening of internal 
processes and customer reach, the company is well-positioned to drive scale and efficiency in the coming quarters.”
