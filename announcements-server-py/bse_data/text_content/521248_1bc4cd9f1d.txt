M&M, Manulife JV to tap 
into the insurance boom 
EQUAL PARTNERS. Joint venture could see ¥18,000-30,000 crore valuation in 10 years 
— 
Aroosa Ahmed 
Mumbai 
Mahindra &  Mahindra 
(M&M) and Canada’s Man- 
ulife have announced an 
agreement to form a 50:50 
life insurance joint venture 
in India, that has the poten- 
tial to reach a valuation of 
¥18,000-30,000 crore in 10 
years. 
The total capital commit- 
ment from each shareholder 
is up to 3,600 crore (8400 
million) with expectation of 
each shareholder investing 1,250 crore ($140 million) 
inthefirst § years. 
“We expect to invest ¥250 
crore a year for the first five years. The real investment 
will start in FY28 because of 
the regulatory approvals re- 
quired. From a Mahindra 
standpoint, Manulife will in- 
vest an equal amount, and 
forus, that would be roughly about 1/3 of the dividend 
TO BE NO.1. The total capital commitment from each 
shareholder is up to ¥3,600 crore 
that we would expect from 
Mahindra Finance in that 
time periodaswell,” said An- ish Shah, Group CEO & Man- 
aging Director, Mahindra 
Group. 
“From a JV perspective, 
Manulife will contribute the 
same amount, and the global 
reinsurance expertise can 
potentially help bring it 
down further as well. This 
can result in a valuation of 
18,000 to ¥30,000 crore in 
10 years, and we feel these are conservative numbers. If 
‘Firm growth, low inflation 
may make rate action in 
Deca close call for RBI’ 
— 
Our Bureau 
Mumbai 
Firm growth and inflation 
undershoot makes the rate- 
setting monetary policy 
committee’s December rate 
decision a close call, say economists. 
CPI inflation ~ reading 
came at a record low of 0.25 
per cent for October even as 
GDP growth is expected to 
hold up at about 7.5 per cent 
inthe second quarter. 
The higher growth num- 
bers for Q2 (July-Septem- 
ber) and the October infla- 
tion print will pose a serious 
dilemma for the RBI for a 
rate action in December, ac- 
cording to State Bank of In- 
dia’s economic research de- 
partment (ERD). 
The ERD has estimated 
real GDPto expand by 7.5 per 
cent in Q2 FY26. The CPI 
(retail) inflation moderated 
to an all-time low 0f 0.25 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) in 
October 2025, helped by de- cline in food & beverages in- flation as prices of veget- 
pared toRBI’s estimateat 1.8 
per cent and a sub-3 per cent 
print in January-March 2026 
vs RBD’s 4 per cent projec- 
tion. 
This paves the way for at least 50-60 basis points (bps) 
reduction in the FY26 annual 
(inflation) forecast. 
Further, based on the 
Q2FY26 growth numbers 
that will be out in late- 
November, the full-year 
growth might be revised up marginally. Passage of an US-India 
trade deal before the Decem- 
ber rate review, will also be 
an important input for poli- 
cymalkers. 
RATE REDUCTIONS 
To make a case for rate re- 
ductions ~ despite  strong 
growth numbers, Rao ob- 
served that the MPC will 
likely highlight risks to the forward-looking growth tra- 
jectory, with prevailing low 
inflation  providing them 
with the necessary room to 
reduce lower rates. 
“While a cut is not a fore- 
gone conclusion, we see a 
more than even chance of a 
a composite license is al- 
lowed, then that valuation 
can increase significantly,” 
Shah added. M&M is also 
planning to expand into gen- 
eral insurance. 
M&M’S VISION 
“Life insurance is under- 
penetrated today, and we see 
a tremendous opportunity 
here, which is why we've started with life. If the insur- 
ance regulations permit a 
composite license, ~ that 
could be a potential upside

Jaypee Infratech 
MDinx14,599-cr 
fraud case 
— 
Our Bureau 
New Delhi 
The Enforcement Director- 
ate (ED) on Thursday arres- 
ted Manoj Gaur, former 
Managing Director of Jaypee 
Infratech Ltd, in connection 
with a money-laundering in- vestigation linked to an al- 
leged ¥14,599-crore fraud in- 
volving homebuyers’ funds, official sources said. 
Gaur was taken into cus- 
tody under the Prevention of 
Money Laundering  Act 
(PMLA) following an ongo- 
ing probe into alleged diver- sion of money collected from thousands of homebuyers, leaving several Jaypee hous- 
ing projectsincomplete. 
According to the agency, 
the investigation revealed that large sums collected by 
Jaiprakash Associates Ltd 
(JAL) and Jaypee Infratech 
Ltd (JIL) for residential pro- 
jects were diverted to other 
group entities and trusts in- 
stead of being used for con- struction. “Out of approxim- 
ately ¥14,599 crore collected 
from homebuyers, substan- 
for the JV, and that’s some- 
thing we will evaluate when 
the opportunity arises. Addi- 
tionally, general insurance is 
attractive as well,” he said. 
The new venture will 
strengthen Mahindra and 
Manulife’s existing footprint 
inIndia. 
Mahindra & Mahindra 
said its vision is to be the 
number 1life insurance com- 
pany in rural and semi-urban India and to serve urban cus- 
tomers through leadership in protection solutions. 
“Only 2 per cent of life in- surance branches are in rural 
and semi-urban areas, and as 
we talk more about the 
product, we see income. We 
feel that insurance will have 
an important role there, and 
some will want products be- 
sides protection, which we will offer aswell. We just feel 
that if we can offer a strong 
protection product, it’s a 
positive for us in that sense,” 
added Anish Shah. 
SBI to complete core infra 
modernisation in 2 years

Our Bureau 
Mumbai 
State Bank of India (SBI) will 
complete modernisation of 
its core-banking infrastruc- 
ture within the next two 
years as part of its plan to re- 
architect its core systems for 
greater agility and scale, ac- 
cording to Ashwini Kumar 
Tewari, Managing Director 
(Corporate  Banking & Subsidiaries). ‘The bank is also buildinga private cloud infrastructure 
to ensure scalability while 
maintaining regulatory com- 
pliance and data security. 
Tewari emphasised that 
the bank’s roadmap to trans- 
form its legacy systems in- 
volves a four-axis strategy — 
upgrading its hardware, mi- grating from Unix to Linux, 
hollowing out the core by ex- 
ternalising functions such as vendor and government pay- 
ments, and introducing mi- 
croservices for operations 
like inquiries and account- ing. “We are modernising as 
we run the ship. Our systems 
must always remain on and 
available to customers,” he 
said at the Singapore Fintech 
Fest. 
INNOVATION HUB 
To encourage innovation, 
Tewari noted that SBI has 
developed a sandbox and an innovation hub, opening ac- 
cess to nearly 300 APIs (Ap- 
plication Programming In- 
terfaces) that allow fintechs 
to test and integrate their 
solutions with the bank’s 
systems. 
Along with agility, con- 
Vvenience, intuitiveness, in- 
terface, security and compli- 
ance, the ability to meet the 
scale of SBI's operations is a 
crucial parameter for fintech 
onboarding, headded. 
The SBI MD highlighted 
that the bank is deploying agentic Al through a fintech 
partner to verify trade fin- 
ance documents such as 
guarantees and letters of 
credit, helping both internal teams and  customers 
achieve faster, more accurate 
processing. He noted that Al 
applications are also being explored in areas like service ticket resolution and docu- 
ment analysis to enhance op- 
erational efficiency.
