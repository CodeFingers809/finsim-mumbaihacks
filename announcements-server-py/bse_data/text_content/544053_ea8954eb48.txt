Independent Auditor’s Limited Review Report on Unaudited Financial Results of the Company 
for the quarter and half year ended 30 Sept., 2025 pursuant to Regulation 33 of Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015. 
To, 
The Board of Directors of, 
Motisons Jewellers Limited 
We have reviewed the accompanying the statement of unaudited financial results of Motisons 
Jewellers Limited for the Quarter and Half year ended 30" Sept., 2025 attached herewith, being 
submitted by the company pursuant to Regulation 33 of Securities and Exchange Board of India 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015. 
This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company Management and approved by the 
Company Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 (Ind AS 34) “Interim Financial 
Reporting”, prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the 
Statement based on our review. 
We conducted our review in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagement (SRE) 2410 
“Review of Interim Financial Information performed by the independent Auditor of the Entity”, 
issued by the institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and 
perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement. ¢

A review is limited primary to inquire of company personnel and analytical procedures applied to 
financial data and thus provides less assurance than an audit and consequently does not enable 
us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be 
identified in an audit. Accordingly, we have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion. 
Based on our review conducted as stated above, nothing has come to our attention that causes 
us to believe that the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results prepared in 
accordance with applicable Indian Accounting standard (“Ind AS”) and other recognized 
accounting practices and policies as amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and 
other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information require 
to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it 
contains any material misstatement.
