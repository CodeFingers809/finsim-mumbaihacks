Independent Auditor's Review Report on Unaudited Standalone Financial Results of Kirloskar

Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015,

To, 
The Board of Directors of 
Kirloskar Industries Limited 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited standalone financial results of 
Kirloskar Industries Limited (the "Company") for the quarter and half year ended September 
30, 2025 ("the Statement") attached herewith, being submitted by the Company pursuant to 
the requirement of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, as amended (the "Listing Regulations"). 
2. This statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and has been 
approved by the Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial 
Reporting" ("Ind AS 34"), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act") 
as amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to express conclusion on the Statement based 
on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity", issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons 
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review 
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with 
Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would 
become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we 
do not express an audit opinion.

Independent Auditor's Review Report on Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results of 
Kirloskar Industries Limited for Quarter and Half year ended September 30, 2025 Pursuant 
to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, as amended 
To, 
The Board of Directors of 
Kirloskar Industries Limited 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited consolidated financial 
results of Kirloskar Industries Limited (the "The Holding Company") and its subsidiaries (the 
Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the "Group") for the quarter 
and half year ended September 30, 2025 (the "Statement") attached herewith, being 
submitted by the Holding Company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the 
SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (the 
"Listing Regulations"). 
2. The statement, which is the responsibility of the Holding Company's Management and 
approved by the Holding Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance 
with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 
34 "Interim Financial Reporting" ("Ind AS 34"), prescribed under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 as amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder, and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to express a 
conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity", issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of 
persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other 
review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in 
accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain 
assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be • 
in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
