Rating Rationale
Acuité has reaffirmed its long-term rating of 
‘ACUITE BBB-’ (read as ACUITE triple B minus)
 and
short-term rating of 
'ACUITE A3+' (read as ACUITE A three plus) 
on the Rs. 55.00 crore bank
facilities of Gujarat Craft Industries Limited (GCIL). The outlook is 
'Stable'
.
Further, Acuité has assigned long-term rating of 
‘ACUITE BBB-’ (read as ACUITE triple B minus)
on the Rs. 15.00 crore bank facilities of Gujarat Craft Industries Limited (GCIL). The outlook is
'Stable'.
Rationale for rating
The rating reaffirmation reflects GCIL’s steady scale of operations supported by favorable
market conditions, along with adequate liquidity and a moderate financial risk profile. The
rating also draws comfort from long operational track record and experienced management.
The rating is however constrained by the working capital-intensive nature of operations and
exposure to raw material price fluctuations, forex risk in a competitive industry.

Key Rating Drivers
Strengths
Established track record of operations and experienced management
GCIL has an established track record of operations dating back almost four decades, along
with experienced management. The company is currently managed by Mr. Rishab Chhajer.
The promoter and management of the company have experience of over four decades in
the industry which reflected in the growing scale of operations. The experience of the
promoters have helped the company to maintain a longstanding relationship with its
customers and suppliers.  Acuité believes that the long operational track record coupled
with the experience of the management will continue to benefit GCIL going forward, resulting
in steady growth in the scale of operations.
Steady improvement in Revenue and Profitability
The revenue of the company has improved in FY25 and stood at Rs. 202.90 Cr. as compared
to Rs. 175.58 Cr. in FY24 due to increased business from existing customers. Further, there are
high demands, and favourable market conditions that are contributing factors to this growth.
The company reported revenue of Rs. 92.03 Cr in H1FY26 as against Rs. 86.78 Cr in H1FY25.
In FY25, EBITDA margin stood at 6.26 per cent as compared to 6.32 per cent in FY24. The slight
drop in EBITDA margins was due to increase in employee cost and other manufacturing cost.
The company done advancement in flexible intermediate bulk containers during FY25 that
required intensive labour work.  The profit after tax (PAT) for FY25 stood at Rs. 2.69 Cr as
against Rs. 3.02 Cr. in FY24. The decline in PAT is due to increase in interest cost and
depreciation costs. Acuite believes, the operating performance of the company would
remain steady over the medium term.
Moderate Financial Risk Profile
The company has moderate financial risk profile marked by moderate net worth, moderate
gearing and average debt protection metrics. The net worth increased to Rs. 41.73 Cr. in FY25
as against Rs. 39.57 Cr. in FY24. The company’s total debt increased to Rs. 59.78 Cr. as on
March 31, 2025, as against Rs. 49.87 Cr. as on March 31, 2024. The debt profile comprises of Rs.
11.95 Cr of long-term debt, Rs. 11.30 Cr of USL, Rs. 33.55 Cr of short-term debt and Rs. 2.98 Cr of
CPLTD. The overall gearing declined to 1.43 times as on March 31, 2025, as against 1.26 times
as on March 31, 2024, majorly due to increase in total debt. The TOL/TNW stood at 2.27 times
as on March 31, 2025, as against 1.99 times as on March 31, 2024.
The interest coverage ratio (ICR) stood at 2.63 times in FY25 as against 3.08 times in FY24.
Further debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) stood at 1.69 times in FY25 as compared to 1.80
times in FY24. The NCA/TD stood at 0.12 times in FY25 as against 0.13 times in FY24. Acuite
believes, the financial risk profile is expected to remain moderate on the back of steady
accruals.
 
Weaknesses
Moderately intensive Working Capital operations
 
The operations of the company remained moderately working capital intensive marked by
gross current assets (GCA) of 163 days in FY25 as against 162 days in FY24. The company
maintains inventory levels of around 102 days in FY25 as against 99 days for FY24. The inventory
is managed as per the orders received from the clients as it is rotating in nature. The Debtor
days stood at 52 days in FY25 as against 55 days for FY24. Furthermore, the creditor days
stood at 65 days in FY25 as against 54 days in FY24. Credit period to customers have
lengthened, especially in the US and Europe, impacting on the working capital cycle and
increasing working capital funding requirements. The working capital gap is funded by working
capital borrowings from Bank. GCIL has high reliance on the bank limit utilisation as the
average utilization stood at ~90 per cent for six months ending October 2025.
Susceptibility of margins to raw material price fluctuations and foreign exchange fluctuation risk
As GCIL is engaged in the manufacturing of FIBC bags, the major raw materials required to
manufacture such products are polypropylene granules and low-density polyethylene, which
are derivatives of crude oil, and the prices of crude oil are directly affected by various
macroeconomic factors. Similarly, the prices of such raw materials are also volatile in nature
and are imported to extend of ~30 per cent which is hedged and such fluctuations in the
major raw material prices may impact the operating profit margin of the company.
Furthermore, the company also deals in exports to various countries across the globe, which
contribute around 40-50 per cent to the total revenues in FY2025. As a result, the company’s
business is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. However, such risks are
mitigated to some extent due to natural hedging and the forward contracts entered by the
company for managing the forex risk.
Rating Sensitivities
Significant 
increase in the scale of operation along with operating profitability.
Further elongation of working capital cycle.
Changes in financial risk profile
 
Liquidity Position
Adequate
The company’s liquidity position is adequate, marked by sufficient net cash accruals against
the maturing debt obligations. The company has generated net cash accruals in of Rs 7.27
Cr. in FY2025 against its maturing repayment obligations of Rs. 2.26 Cr. in the same tenure.
Further, the company is expected to generate sufficient cash accruals to repay its debt
obligation in near to medium term. However, the working capital management of the
company is intensive marked by GCA of 163 days in FY2025 as against 162 days in FY2024.
Further, GCIL has high reliance on the bank limit utilisation as the average utilization stood at
~90 per cent for six months ending October 2025. The current ratio stands at 1.37 times as on
March 31, 2025, as against 1.47 times as on March 31, 2024.

Note on complexity levels of the rated instrument
In order to inform the investors about complexity of instruments, Acuité has categorized such
instruments in three levels: Simple, Complex and Highly Complex. Acuite’s categorisation of
the instruments across the three categories is based on factors like variability of the returns to
the investors, uncertainty in cash flow patterns, number of counterparties and general
understanding of the instrument by the market. It has to be understood that complexity is
different from credit risk and even an instrument categorized as 'Simple' can carry high levels
of risk. For more details, please refer Rating Criteria “Complexity Level Of Financial
Instruments” on
