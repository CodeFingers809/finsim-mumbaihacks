Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) on Dividend 
 
Shareholders may note that pursuant to the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (‘the Act’) as amended 
by the Finance Act, 2020, dividend income will be taxable in the hands of the shareholders and the Company 
is required to deduct tax at source (TDS) at the time of making the payment of dividend to shareholders at 
the prescribed rates. The tax deduction / withholding tax rate would vary depending on the residential 
status of the shareholder and the exemptions as enumerated in the Act subject to fulfilling the 
documentary requirements.  
 
The TDS/ Withholding tax provisions for both categories of shareholders viz. Resident and Non -Resident 
are detailed below: 
 
1. Resident shareholders: 
 
Tax will be deducted at source (“TDS”) under Section 194 of the Act @ 10% on the amount of dividend payable 
unless exempt under any of the provisions of the Act subject to fulfilment of the following conditions: 
 
1.      Valid Permanent Account Number (“PAN”) will be mandatorily required. 
2.       Shareholders holding shares under multiple accounts under different status/ category (e.g., Resident 
and Non-Resident) and single PAN, may note that, higher of the tax as applicable to the status in 
which shares held under a PAN will be considered on their entire holding in different accounts. 
 
Apart from the above, specific provisions applicable to Resident-Individuals and Resident Non-Individuals 
and other shareholders are given below for ready reference: 
 
1A.   Resident Shareholders (Individual): 
 
1.   In case of Individuals, TDS would not apply if the aggregate of total dividend paid to them by the 
Company under folio(s) during FY 2025-26 does not exceed Rs. 10,000/-. 
2.  Tax will not be deducted at source in cases where a shareholder provides duly signed Form 
15G (Annexure-1) (applicable to an individual below the age of 60 years) / Form 15H (Annexure-2) 
(applicable to an individual of the age of 60 years and above), provided that the eligibility conditions 
  
are met. Blank Form 15G and 15H are attached with this communication or can be downloaded from 
the website of the RTA viz. www.bigshareonline.com 
3.    Shareholders who are required to link Aadhaar number with PAN as required under section 139AA(2) 
read with Rule 114AAA, should compulsorily link the same within the timelines as specified by 
Government of India failing which the PAN will become inoperative and Tax would be deducted at a 
higher rate under section 206AA of the Act. However, this is subject to amendments issued by the 
Income Tax authorities from time to time. For the purpose of verification of PAN-Aadhaar linkage, 
Company will verify the status from the Government enabled online facility after the expiry of cut-off 
date kept for submission of declaration and other forms and deduct TDS accordingly. 
4.    Valid PAN will be mandatorily required. However, if the PAN is not updated or is invalid or is deleted or 
becomes inoperative on account of non-linking with Aadhaar then the higher rate as per the Act (i.e., 
20%) would apply subject to threshold prescribed in the Act. 
5.  For shareholders who have obtained a certificate from the income-tax authorities under section 197 of 
the Act for TDS at a lower/Nil rate, tax will be deducted at the rate specified in the said certificate 
subject to furnishing a self-attested copy of the same. The certificate should be valid for FY 2025-26.
