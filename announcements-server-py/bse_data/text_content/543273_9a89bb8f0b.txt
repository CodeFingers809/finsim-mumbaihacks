Independent Auditor's Review Report on the quarterly and half yearly Unaudited 
Consolidated Financial Results of the Company Pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBL 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended 
To 
The Board of Directors 
Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works Limited 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited Consolidated financial results of 
M/s Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works Limited (The Company) for the quarter and 
half year ended on 30" September 2025, (the Statement) attached herewith, being submitted by 
the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements), Regulations, 2015, (‘the Regulation’) as amended (the "Listing 
Regulations"), 
2. This Statement which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and approved by the 
Holding Company's Board of Directors has been prepared in accordance with the recognition 
and measurement principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standards 34 "Interim 
Financial reporting” notified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the 'Act') as 
amended, read with relevant rules issued there under and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India and in compliance with regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. Our 
responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standards on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410, 'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity’, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
("ICAI"), This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate 
assurance as to whether the Statement is free from material misstatement. A review of interim 
financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for 
financial and accounting matters and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review 
is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing 
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all 
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit 
opinion. 
   
4. Based on our review conducted as stated above, except for the effects/possible effects of our 
observations stated in the Emphasis of Matter below, nothing has come to our attention that 
causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement of the unaudited Financial Results read 
with notes thereon, prepared in accordance with recognition and measurement principles laid 
down in the aforesaid Accounting Standards specified under Section 133 of the Companies 
Act, 2013 as amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other recognized 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to 
be disclosed in terms of the Regulations of the Listing Regulations, including the manner in 
which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement. 
Emphasis of Matter 
Company as a sub-contractor has raised invoices for certain dues to be recovered from the main 
contractor (Dredging Corporation of India, DCI). Main Contractor in turn has raised invoices 
for the same dues to its Principal employer (Department of Fisheries, Government of Gujarat, 
DOF). The main contractor has made the partial payment of Rs.14.13 crores after receiving the 
same from the principal employer and the balance outstanding due from main contractor as on 
30" September 2025 is Rs.24.88 crores which will be paid once the principal employer releases 
the same to the main contractor. Management is confident of recovering the same basis the 
communication of the main contractor with the principal employer, hence no provision is 
considered as on 30" September 2025. 
Other matters 
The Statement includes the results of its group companies :- 
a) Knowledge dredging Co. W.L.L. (subsidiary Company) 
b} Knowledge Marine Co. W.L.L. (wholly owned subsidiary Company) 
c) Knowledge Infra Ports Private Limited (Subsidiary Company) 
d) Indian Ports Dredging Private Limited (Subsidiary Company) 
e) KMEW Offshore Private Limited (Associate Company) 
f) Kamal Marine & Engineering Works Private Limited (acquired as on 6" August 2025) 
We did not audit the interim financial statements of “Knowledge Marine Co. W.L.L & Knowledge 
Dredging Co. W.LL.” subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial results, whose financial 
statements reflect total revenue is Rs.362.68 lacs and Rs.1802.37 lacs and net profit after tax is 
Rs.340.72 lacs and Rs.771.48 lacs (before eliminating inter-company transactions) for the quarter 
and half year ended September 30, 2025, respectively, as considered in the statement. The interim 
financial statement of the said Companies has been prepared in accordance with generally accepted 
  
auditor of the said Company and whose report has been furnished to us by the management. Our 
conclusion in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of said 
subsidiary, is based solely on the review reports of the other auditors and management certification 
and the procedures performed by us as stated in paragraph 3 above. 
We did not review the interim financial results of one new acquired subsidiary - Kamal Marine & 
Engineering Works Private Limited which has not been reviewed by their respective auditor, whose 
interim financial information as provided by the management duly certified, reflect total Revenue 
from operation of Rs.5.16 crores, total net profit after tax of Rs.1.52 crores (before eliminating 
inter group transactions) for the period from 6"" August 2025, to September 30, 2025, as considered 
in the statement. According to the information and explanations given to us by the Management, 
this interim financial information are not material to the Company. 
Our conclusion on the consolidated Financial Results is not modified in respect of the above matters 
with respect to our reliance on the work done and the reports of the other auditors and the financial 
Results/financial information certified by the Board of Directors.

1 During the period, the vessel River Pearl 18, owned by the wholly-owned foreign subsidiary Knowledge Manne Co. WLL (KMj and 
deployed in Bahrain, was sold and transferred to Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works Limited (KMEW), India in July 2025. The 
transfer was undertaken considering better operational opportunities and the immediate requirement of the vessel for projects 
awarded in India. The vessel is a specialised custom-built asset, making it more suitable and efficient for execution of the ongoing 
and upcoming domestic projects. 
  
The asset River Pearl 18 has been sold at an arm’s length price by Knowledge Marine Co. WLL (KM), Bahrain to Knowledge Marine & 
Engineering Works Limited (KMEW), India. The difference between the book value and the arm's length price of the vessel has been 
recorded as “Profit on Sale of Asset” in the books of KM amounting to Rs. 295.15 Lakhs. 
However, in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, the said profit has not been recognised, and the carrying value of the 
asset has been reduced by an equivalent amount. This adjustment has been made in accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 
110 = Consolidated Financial Statements, which mandates the elimination of unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions 
during consolidation: 
The reduction in Trade Payables and Borrowings in the Consolidated Financial Statements as compared to the Standalone Financial 
Statements 1s due to the elimination of intra-group balances in accordance with Ind AS 110 - Consolidated Financial Statements. 
The balances pertain to (1) purchase of the vessel River Pearl 18 from Knowledge Marine Co. WLL, Bahrain amounting to Rs. 3,919.79 
Lakhs, and (iij loan advanced by KMEW to the subsidiary amounting to Rs. 3.909 Lakhs. These balances have been offset during 
consolidation. Disclosures relating to these transactions are made in accordance with Ind AS 24 - Related Party Disclosures.

Limited Review Report on Unaudited Standalone Financial Results of the Company for the 
Quarter and Half Year ended on September 30, 2025, Pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the 
SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended 
To 
The Board of Directors 
Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works Limited 
1, We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited standalone financial results of 
M/s Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works Limited (The Company) for the quarter and 
Half Year ended on 30" September, 2025, (the Statement) attached herewith, being submitted 
by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEB] (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended including the relevant Circulars 
issued by SEBI from time to time (Listing Regulations). 
2. This Statement which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and approved by the 
Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standards 34 "Interim Financial 
reporting” notified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the ‘Act’), as amended, read 
with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in 
India and in compliance with regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. Our responsibility is to 
express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
3, We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standards on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410, ‘Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity’, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
("ICAI"). This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate 
assurance as to whether the Statement is free from material misstatement. A review of interim 
financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for 
financial and accounting matters and applying analytical and other review procedures and thus 
provides less assurance than an audit. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit 
conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable ust, 
   
obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified 
in an audit. We have not performed an audit and, accordingly, we do not express an audit 
opinion. 
Based on our review conducted as above, except for the effects/possible effects of our 
observations stated in the Emphasis of Matter below, nothing has come to our attention that 
causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement of the unaudited Financial Results read 
with notes thereon, prepared in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards specified 
under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 as amended, read with relevant rules issued 
thereunder and other recognized accounting practices and policies has not disclosed the 
information required to be disclosed in terms of the Regulation , read with the Circular, 
including the matter in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement. 
Emphasis of Matter 
Company as a sub-contractor has raised invoices for certain dues to be recovered from the 
main contractor (Dredging Corporation of India, DCD. Main Contractor in turn has raised 
invoices for the same dues to its Principal employer (Department of Fisheries, Government of 
Gujarat, DOF). The main contractor has made the partial payment of Rs.14.13 crores after 
receiving the same from the principal employer and'the balance outstanding due from main 
contractor as on 30" September 2025 is Rs.24.88 crores which will be paid once the principal 
employer releases the same to the main contractor. Management is confident of recovering the 
same basis the communication of the main contractor with the principal employer, hence no 
provision is considered as on 30" September 2025.
