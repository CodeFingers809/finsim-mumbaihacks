Sub: Submission of Information under Re ulation 30 of SEBI Listin Obli ations
and Disclosure Re uirements Re ulations 2015
Dear Sir/Madam,
Pursuant to provisions of Regulation 30 read with sub-para 8 of Para B of Part A of Schedule
Ill of SEBI (Listing Obligations & Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 ("Listing
Regulations"), as amended, we hereby submit an update on our previous disclosure dated
April 01, 2025 and subsequent updates under quarterly integrated filing (Governance),
regarding Order received from the office of Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax, Circle
7(1), Delhi under section 143(3) read with section 263 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 on a
demand of Rs. 110. 33 crores.
U date
The Company has received a favourable ITAT order whereby the Hon'ble ITAT has quashed
the demand of Rs. 59.37 crores raised in the earlier order issued by the authorities under
section 263 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and accordingly the demand of Rs 110.33 crores is
now reduced to Rs. 50. 96 crores against which the Company is already in appeal before the
CIT(Appeals).
As informed earlier also, the financial implication in the matter is unlikely. The financial impact,
if any, will be limited to the extent of final tax liability as may be ascertained by higher appellate
authorities.
The ITAT Order was received on November 18, 2025, at 03. 36 PM.
This is for your information and records.
Thanking You,
Yours faithfully,
For Dabur India Limited
