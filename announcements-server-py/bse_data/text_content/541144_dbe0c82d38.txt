analysts, investors and stakeholders present on today's call. It is a pleasure to share the 
highlights of our performance for H1 Financial Year 2026, along with the key 
developments during Q2. 
Let me begin with a brief overview of our company. Active Clothing Company Limited has 
grown over the last 25 years into one of India's leading integrated design-to-shelf apparel 
‘manufacturing platforms. Our capabilities cover the full value chain from conceptual design 
and 3D prototyping to automated manufacturing, quality assurance, logistics, and multi- 
brand detail support. Our product portfolio spans flat knitted sweaters, circular knitted 
garments, outerwear jackets, woven apparel, fly knit uppers, accessories and layer wear 
categories. With a state of art facility at Fatehgarh Sahib and employing over 2300 skilled 
team members, we continue to deliver high quality products to a wide portfolio of global 
fashion brands. From a broader perspective, the apparel industry continues to evolve with 
the increasing focus on reliability, faster development cycles, and stronger integration 
between design, manufacturing, and delivery. Trends such as automation, digital 
workflows, and sustainability remain important. And our investments over the past few 
years are well aligned with these expectations. Technology and sustainability remains core 
to our strategy. Our virtual design development centre supports faster approvals and

Let me now come to the key operational update of Q2 FY2026. During the quarter, we 
entered into a long-term partnership with Ningbo Shipping Company Limited, the world's 
largest manufacturer of computerized flat knitting machines. Under this agreement, we will 
add 600 advanced machines to our existing fleet of 352 units, marking the creation of 
India's first knit-to-shape smart kuitting factory. Built around 3D seamiess knitting, 
automation, and zero-waste production, this expansion significantly enhances our capability 
and scale, particularly in the sweater vertical. This initiative will support better consistency, 
design flexibility, and faster turnaround for our global customers. We also received Crisil 
ratings during the quarter for our Rs. 102 Crores bank loan facilities with a BBB stable long- 
term rating and an A3 plus short-term rating reflecting the company’s financial discipline 
and operational strength. 
Now turning to the financial performance, the company reported a total income of Rs.83.19 
Crores in Q2 FY2026. EBITDA for the quarter stood at Rs.7.39 Crores with an EBITDA 
margin of 8.88% while net profit was Rs.2.79 Crores with a PAT margin of 3.36%. For first 
half of financial year 2026 total income amounted to Rs.147.66 Crores, marking a year-on- 
year growth of 15.22%, EBITDA for the first half stood at Rs.14.35 Crores with an 
EBITDA margin of 9.72% and net profit was Rs.4.92 Crores with a PAT margin of 3.34%. 
Operating cash flow improved to Rs.8.16 Crores driven by the disciplined working capital 
‘management and continued focus on operational efficiencies. 
The first half of the year demonstrates steady progress across manufacturing, customer 
servicing and internal processes supported by our integrated operating model and consistent 
delivery to the global partners. Our investments in technology, efficiency, and product 
development continue to reinforce our long-term platform for growth. As we move ahead, 
our focus remains on strengthening design to self-capabilities, scaling smart manufacturing, 
expanding product categories, and deepening partnerships with leading global brands. The 
Need to Shape initiative will play a significant role in enhancing our technological 
capabilities and supporting efficient, high-precision production. Before I conclude, I would 
like to thank our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, board members, and investors 
for their continued trust and support. With that, we now open the floor for your questions. 
Thank you very much. 
Thank you so much. We will now begin with the question and answer session. Anyone who 
wishes to ask a question may click on the Raise Hand icon from the participant tab on your 
screen. We will wait for the question queue to assemble. We will take our first question 
from Pritam Shah from MMTC. Mr. Shah, please unmute your microphone and go ahead 
with your question.

Hello Mr Shah. 
Yes, thank you for the opportunity and good evening everyone. So my first question is that 
your EBITDA margins dipped in Q2. So what were the simple key reasons of that like 
higher cost, lower utilization, or something else? 
No, it is international. We are into international market because of the change scenario of 
American market. So there are fluctuations in the market. So we are trying to insulate with 
that thing. That is it. 
Ok. And with the new kit to shape machines, do you expect margins to gradually improve 
over the next few years? 
Yeah, definitely. 
Okay. And any your raw material prices especially for the cotton and yam are relatively 
stable now. So, compared to last year. 
Market is very stable. The only thing s that with the tariffs on Indian trade by the American 
government. So that has affected the whole market. So things look positive in future. What 
indications we are receiving are very, very positive. So once things have settled between 
both the countries, T think we should have a good trade. 
And could you please share the approximate segment wise revenue split, sweaters, jackets, 
t-shirts and approximate segment wise revenue split. 
Segment wise revenue split. 
Sweaters, jackets, t-shirts. 
Yes, we will share that data with you. No problem. 
Okay and how any approximation that how each segment has grew in H1? From last, how 
each of the segment has grown in H1? 
Every segment is growing. Temporarily, the growth plans have not been matured only 
because of the American market, because American market is the main consumption 
market. So with this tariff, systems are disturbed in the country. And it is not for active 
s all across for all different industries in this country.

Right, right. 
So we cannot be insulated or we cannot be the ones who are insulated from this thing. So 
with this American trade shifting, so people are moving to different markets. We are also 
moving to different markets. We are also exploring European markets. But it takes time to 
mature the new markets. 
Okay. And any growth projection tentatively for upcoming 2-3 years? 
No, definitely we have already expanded, our capital work is already under progress. And if 
the American markets open, we should be growing the way we have been growing. 
Okay fine that is it from my side for now and we will get back to you. 
Thank you Mr Shah. 
Thank you so much. We will have our next question coming in from Anjana Nambiar from 
Orion Capital. 
Thank you. Am I audible? 
Yes, you are audible Anjana. 
Sir, my first question will be, could you give us a sense of how demand has been across 
sweaters, jackets, t-shirts and shoe uppers in H1? 
HI, the demands have been very good. That is the reason our top line is increased, but it has 
Dot increased substantially because of this American market. Otherwise, the demand is 
good. And in all segments we are growing. 
Yes, any noticeable change versus last year. 
No, we have grovwn. The top line is grown. 
Ok. 
Yeah. Although the effect of American market is there, but still we are growing. We tend to 
grow more once the American market opens. 
Okay. So my second question will be like within exports apart from USA, are you seeing 
any demand across Europe and other markets?

Yes, we are trying to explore more European market also. So we are recruiting more people 
to tap the European market. Let us see how the demand comes from the European market. It 
is not only we, so as industry, there is a lot of shift towards the European market. So it 
becomes more competitive also. 
Okay. 
It is for everybody. There are big suppliers who have been supplying to American markets. 
They are all hard, badly hit. Our exports to American market were very less. So we are not 
hit actually. Our growth plans are slowed down, but we are not hit. We are growing. Other 
companies in this apparel trade or other trades, they are badly hit. Their profits have come 
down. They are at losses. 
Okay. Yes. My last question will be like, given the winter heavy product mixes seasonality 
still playing out the same way or has there been a change? 
‘We are now into exports to Europe, to America, to different countries. So we are not 
affected by the season. It is a continuous process. It is only in India that winters are there. 
But as we are catering to exports, so we are catering to, if they are Europe, the requirement 
is for 10 months. Yesterday, UK had a snowfall. So everywhere the winter is mostly the 
temperature is there where winter could be kind of clothes are being wom in. 
Ok. Yes, Sir, that is all from my side. Thank you for answering my question. 
Thank you Anjana. 
Thank you so much. We would like to remind participants to click on the raise hand icon if 
you wish to ask a question. We will wait for the question queue to assemble. We have our 
next question coming in from Anand Gupta, an individual investor. Mr. Gupta, please go 
ahead. 
Anand Gupta s already invested in the company? 
Hi. Yes, I am invested with the company. 
Okay. Tell me Mr. Gupta. 
Sir, for Q2 FY2026, on a year-on-year basis, our revenues have grown by 1.65%, but our 
employee benefit expenses have grown up by 8%. So I just want to understand why is it in 
this way? I mean, employee benefit expenses form about.

Employee benefit means it includes the wages also. It is not only the benefit. Benefit 
includes everything including the direct cost of the wages also. 
Right. So, the employee benefit expenses in case of our company is about between 16% to 
18% of our revenue. Yeah. So my question is that the revenue from operations have gone 
up by only 1.65% but if1 look at. 
No, we have to retain our people we were looking for expansion it is only because the 
American market which is badly affected. So recruitments have to be there the people have 
to be there only then we can be operational. So this is temporary effect, probably with the 
rising trend in the operation, manufacturing operations. This should be absorbed as soon as 
the American market opens. 
Okay, so this incremental cost is about one Crores in employee benefit expenses that I am 
talking about. And you have a couple of time mentioned about the American market. But if 
you can just help me understand this, in our revenue, right, our export is 25%. Rest all is 
domestic. 
Yes. 
So how are these things tying up? 
Mr Gupta, the players who are into manufacture, for all of them, this American market is 
disrupted, tight? So, they all are looking for different avemues. So, if I am probably 
supplying to X company, so he is also now trying to supply to X company. So, it is a 
competition era. So competition increases. So everything is temporary, but things become 
difficult once such a big company, which had a mass consumption, that consumption has 
gone down or that revenue has gone down. So everybody is looking for alterative markets. 
So that brings in more competition within the same field. And maybe even in the salary and 
wages, 8% to 10% annual increment is justified. That is the cost of inflation you have to 
give it to the workers. Otherwise, they will not stay. So that is the reason you are looking 
into that 1 Crore, that 10 lakhs more into this cost head. 
Okay, sure. Mr. Rajesh, in the last conference call, you spoke about having potential 
additional orders from Levi's at the San Francisco team because you do only domestic now. 
And you highlighted about some additional brands like Lotto and Agilitas, which are 
making a mark in India. And you were hopeful of getting some orders from them? 
‘We in the last six months we did good orders out of the business what we are seeing. So we 
did around Rs.15 Crores of orders from this San Francisco and then Agilitas also, the

sampling work is already processed. We have already signed with them as a manufacturing 
agreement. 
Okay. 
Sampling is in process for summer 2026 orders. 
Okay. Then I will move on quickly to the preferential which were cancelled and I did read 
the reason that was sent out on the stock exchanges. Mr. Rajesh, just want to hear from you 
about how do you plan to raise capital now? 
As of now, we are not looking into any raise of capital. 
Okay. One last question from my end. You mentioned about this additional knitting 
machines. And I know that you are also doing an additional incremental Rs.60 Crores of 
capex. Are these two things related? And if you can give me some more flavour and 
measurable progress on the capex that we announced earlier. 
The Rs.60 Crores what we are doing that s in process and this 600 machines what we are 
saying that we will install in the next coming three years. That would be a bigger capital 
input, but our machinery supplier will give us machinery for five-year deferred payment. So 
there will be no need for us to raise any capital. 
And sir any measurable progress that you can share on the Rs.60 Crores capex, when would 
that be live and how are things progressing? 
That would be live in winter 2026 business, so in the next 2026-2027 financial year, you 
will see the results of that capex, but it is under process. 
Okay, that is all from my end, Mr. Rajesh. Best wishes. 
Thank you. 
Thank you so much. We have Mr. Pritam Shah of MMTC who has re-joined the queue to 
ask a question. Mr. Shah, please go ahead with your question now. 
Yes, thank you. So what is the revenue from export market? 
We will be crossing around Rs.100 Crores this year.

Ok and how are the receivable days in trending? Any changes after the better credit control 
or discussions with the large clients? 
Can you repeat the question? 
How your receivable days are trending? And any change after the better credit control. 
No. There is no change into the receivable days with the customers what we are doing with 
the same customers and whatever business agreements are in place so we are getting our 
payments accordingly. 
Okay and any new other product categories you are evaluating for the clients? 
Not right now, new product category. We are expanding with the new current product 
categories only. 
Okay. And what is your current number of MBO or dealer touch points? And what is their 
contribution to total revenue today? 
Those are around 200 dealers we have and they are doing around Rs.100 Crores of 
business. 
Okay, fine. Thank you for the opportunity once again. 
Okay. 
Thank you so much. 
Okay, Mr. Shah. 
We have our next question coming in from Dhanraj Tolani of Quber Advisors. Please go 
ahead with your question.

First phase will come in the end of first half of 2026-2027 next year. Then every 6 months 
100 machines will come. So first machine to last machine will take 3 years” time. Annually 
200 machines will be installed. 
So what would be the rollout time then and after? 
Before we are already considering 12 months and after once we receive the machine, so in 2 
months’ time those will be installed and go for the production and 3 months is our WIP 
cycle. So from machine to sale it will take 5 months. 
Ok, so on the cost part, are we getting any labour savings or efficiency gains from the net 
saving? 
Yes, labour saving, wastage saving. 
So compared to traditional netting, we are having efficiency gains and labour savings, right? 
Yes. 
Ok. And what would be the overall project cost let's say including machines setup and even 
infrastructure? 
Around 150 to 200 Crores. 
For a single project? 
Sorry? 
For a single project or? 
For 600 machines. 
Okay. Also.. 
The machinery will be funded by the supplier. 
Okay, got it. And are we expecting any new brands because of this technology? 
Yes, , we are already tying up, we are already tying up with a lot of customers who are into 
the mass market like Primark and Marks and Spencer so the audit process is going on and 
hopefully they will be on board in next 3 to 4 months.

So are we targeting new clients? 
Yes with the increased capacity we will target new clients as well as increase the business 
with the current existing customers. 
Ok and if I specifically talk about the new facility, so that would be targeting the existing or 
the new ones? 
New machine production you are talking? 
Yes. 
Currently, we are not making that kind of a product. So that will be available for everyone. 
Okay. 
We will offer to everyone. 
Okay irrespective of new or existing. 
Yeah. 
Okay and I just wanted to know on the financial part so I have seen inventories and 
receivables have increased in FY2025 so what will be the reason behind that? 
With the business that is going up otherwise the cycle which it is last year the same number 
of day cycles approximately we are working. 
Okay so it is due to scaling or are we? 
Our business is like that only it is 210 days to 240 days business cycle. 
Okay. And would like these things like the receivers and inventory would be stabilized in 
the H1 FY2026 mostly? 
Existingly also stabilized. 
Okay. And also I have seen the cash flow in H1 2026 has improved or has been positive. So 
‘what was the main reason behind that? 
Cash flow have increased. Just repeat your question for the cash flow what you are saying?

Yes. So what was the reason behind like in H1 we have seen positive cash flow. So what is 
the reason behind that? 
Could ot get your question? 
T am saying cash flow from operations has been positive in H1 what is the reason behind 
this improvement? 
The margins are improving, sales are improving, everything is improving 
Okay, so that is the main reason. 
Yes. 
So, we were all obviously talking about the efficiency too. So would that impact or the 
better volume is impacting the cash flows? 
No, better volumes will definitely improve the cash flows of the company. 
Okay. 
The company is in a very good financial position. So with growing operations, the cash 
flow of the company s going to improve significantly. 
And this trend would be sustaining? 
Sorry. 
This trend would be sustaining? 
Surely.

Yeah, thank you for the opportunity first of all. So sir, my question is regarding your 
partnership, that is your 22-year-old partnership with Levi's. So how has the business trend 
been with them in H1? Like, are there any new categories added for them? 
On the same categories we are doing. And business is increasing with them. But categories 
are the same. We are not introducing any new category in our manufacturing process. 
Ok, the second would be regarding your virtual design and 3D sampling processes. So are 
global clients actively using that? And I mean, has it helped shorten the turnaround times? 
Yes, it is shortening the tumaround times. And now it has become the mandatory with these 
all big brands. They want everything into 3D designing. And before making to the physical 
sample, they want to analyze the product onto the 3D. So this is the trend now. So if 
anybody does not have the capability, so they are not able to satisfy their customer 
requirement. 
Okay. So, sir, my last question would be, is the customer concentration continuing to reduce 
or broadly similar to the last year? 
Customer contribution or concentration? 
Concentration. 
Yeah, number of customer currently same when this expansion will be which is Rs.60 
Crores expansion which is running and so after two months when it will be operational, 
then we will introduce new customers. The talks are already on and audits are going on. 
And sir one last question is that, did you add any new global or domestic clients in HI or 
early Q3? 
No new client. 
Olaay. 
Last six months, no new client, the same clients. But we expanded the number of countries 
with them. 
Okay. 
Currently we are supplying to 38 countries.

Thank you. We have our next question coming in from Priya Jain of Green Capital. Ms. 
Jain, please unmute your microphone. 
Can you tell me first how many of these are the investors in the company. 
Sir this is from Priya Jain who is from Green Capital. 
This Green Capital is invested in the company. 
Hello sir, am I audible? Currently I am not an investor but I can be. 
Okay, what then what are you looking for? 
T am new to the company. So I am going through the finances and the recent highlights of 
the company. And I have few questions with me today. I will start by, so the other than 
smart knitting projects, what capex is planned for FY2026-272 Any major addition for 
printing, dyeing or finishing lines? 
No, no, there is only knitting machine expense would be there and we told you that this 
project will cost between Rs.150 Crores to Rs.200 Crores where the major investment will 
come from the machinery supplier side and that again will be splitted into three years. So 
2026-2027 would be approximately Rs.60 Crores investment. Out of Rs.60 Crores around 
Rs. 50 Crores will come as a cost of machinery from the machinery supplicr. 
And you have acquired additional and what incremental capacity or new product line would 
support you? 
Incremental you say every six months we will be increasing our capacity by 15 
So any key factor that give you confidence in this multi-year growth plan? Because you see 
very optimistic? 
World is going with the full automation and world is going with kind of manufacturing 
activities where lesser manpower would be there, lesser wastage are there, sustainability is

there. So, we are going forward with adopting that kind of a technology where all these 
benefits are there. 
So also is i, like a purely distribution like margin since you do not own the retail stores. 
How does the business model work with partners brands? 
The partner brand, our margin is fixed with them. We are giving them retail assistance. So 
that margins are fixed year-on-year. The same margins we are working on. Everything is 
protected, Priya? Everything is protected. all the leftover stock, whatever it would be, that 
goes back to the brand. And in this manufacturing, so whatever we are selling, so it is all 
against order. We are not manufacturing a single garment without any order. 
Okay. And as you explained to like 300 plus dealers, are most of the new locations coming 
from tier 1 or tier 2 cities, or a mix of the market? 
Mix of the markets. 
Ok and if any long-term plan to streamline the marketing and distribution vertical into a 
separate business for better focus or even more clarity. 
Currently, it is being run by separate team, complete separate team and but it is focused and 
separate offices are there, separate warchousing is there, so we are focusing it, seeing it 
independently only. There is no mix between these two business verticals. 
Sir one last question. Has the implementation of real time sales tracking improved sales or 
reduced stock return for your partner brands? 
Yeah, we have our software where we do real time tracking of sales. 
Good to hear, sir. And thank you so much for patiently answering all the questions. 
Thank you, Ms Priya. 
Priya, we look forward to your investment in the company now. 
Yes, I am curious and I am eager to have a follow-up mesting. 
And in a big way. 
Yes, sure, sir.

So we are already present in the best of places at the key points. We are already present. 
But tier 2, tier 3 markets are growing and the opportunity is there and getting the chance say 
wherever the right kind of space and business partner we get into we definitely expand 
business with them.

Thank you so much. We will wait for the question queue to assemble. We are taking our 
next question from Anand Gupta who is an individual investor. So 
Yes, he has already spoken, he has already taken a slot before also. 
That is a follow-up question Mr. Mehra. 
Okay, no problem. 
Mr. Gupta. Please go ahead. 
Just one followup question Mr Rajesh. Over a period of 3 years or maybe a little more, 
when the rollout of this 652 knitting machines is complete, what s the maximum revenue or 
peak revenue that they can generate? 
Once this s everything is complete, we will be looking after total and complete company’s 
revenue around Rs.700 Crores.
