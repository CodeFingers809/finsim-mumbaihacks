Chairperson's comments on H1FY26 performance 
"It gives me immense satisfaction to inform that the Company achieved an 11.5% growth in Gross 
Written Premium (GWP) during the six-month period ended September 30, 2025. The domestic business 
registered growth ahead of the industry, resulting in an increase in market share from 12.60% to 13.25% 
during the period. The growth was primarily driven by the health, property, and miscellaneous segments. 
The underwriting performance, however, remained under strain. Multiple flood events across various 
northern states adversely affected the property and motor portfolios. While none of these events were 
individually significant, their aggregate impact placed considerable pressure on the Company's net 
results. The fire portfolio also recorded several large-value losses. In addition, the health segment 
reported a higher loss ratio due to increased claim incidence following a prolonged monsoon season, 
leading to a rise in the overall incurred claims ratio. 
Mrs. Girija Subramanian, CMD During the period, the Company made a provision of 1,680 crore towards wage arrears and the 
consequent increase in liabilities for employee retirement benefits. This provision adversely impacted 
both the underwriting results and overall profitability. However, robust investment income, supported by 
buoyant equity markets, largely mitigated the effect of this additional burden. Operating expenses, 
excluding the impact of wage arrears, were lower compared to the corresponding period of the previous 
year. 
Consequently, the Company reported a 5 7. 7% increase in Profit After Tax for the half year. The solvency 
ratio continues to remain strong and comfortably above the regulatory requirement. 
Looking ahead, I remain optimistic about the Company's operating performance. The Company has 
continued to grow ahead of the industry in October, and loss ratios are expected to improve in the 
second half of the financial year."
