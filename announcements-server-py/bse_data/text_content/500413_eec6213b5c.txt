EXPLANATORY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO SECTION 102 OF THE COMPANIES ACT, 2013
ITEM NOS. 1 and 2:
Employee stock options (ESOP’s) are considered as an effective tool to attract and retain the best talent and also serve to attract, 
incentivize and motivate professionals and reward exceptional performance.
Pursuant to the approval of shareholders vide special resolutions passed through postal ballot on April 17, 2025, the Nomination 
and Remuneration Committee has granted 3478824 out of 5570000 stock options under Thomas Cook Employees Stock Option 
Scheme 2024 - Execom (ESOP 2024 - EXECOM) duly approved by shareholders in the manner prescribed.
In line with the philosophy of promoting the culture of employee ownership, to support the long-term growth plans and to 
achieve sustained growth of the Company and for creation of shareholder value by aligning the interests of the employees 
with the long-term interests of the Company, the Company needs more Employee Stock Options to attract, retain, and motivate 
critical employees and leadership talent.
With this long-term objective, pursuant to recommendation of Nomination and Remuneration Committee and approval 
of the Audit Committee the Board at its meeting held on November 12, 2025, decided to increase the number of stock 
options by 1000000 (Ten Lakh only) to make the total no. of stock options available for grant to 6570000 by modifying the  
ESOP 2024 - EXECOM, subject to consent of the members of the Company. 
The increase of pool balance will also enable the Board to extend the benefit of ESOP 2024 – EXECOM to a wider section of 
eligible employees as part of long-term interests of the Company to align employee interests with the company’s long-term 
vision and ultimately drive shareholder value. The 6570000 stock options upon exercise in conformity with the Scheme shall 
be convertible into equivalent number of Equity Shares of ` 1 each fully paid-up. 
Considering the above objective, in the present instance, the Company is proposing to increase the aggregate number of 
employee stock options (Options) in the existing Plan Pool (i.e., the maximum number of Options that can be granted under 
ESOP 2024 – EXECOM pursuant to which Equity Shares of the Company will get issued upon vesting and exercise thereof) 
by adding additional 1000000 (Ten Lakh only) Options, making the total Plan Pool as originally reserved under the original 
ESOP 2024 – EXECOM from 5570000 stock options revised to a new Pool of 6570000 (Sixty Five Lakh Seventy Thousand only) 
Options. Accordingly, it is proposed to also amend the original clause 3.1 and 7 (d) of ESOP 2024 - EXECOM, each of which is/
shall be convertible into one Equity Share of the Company of the face value of `1 /- each fully paid-up upon exercise of vested 
Options, in accordance with the ESOP 2024 – EXECOM.
It may be noted that Options from the above additional reserve would vest in accordance with the eligibility criteria as is 
mentioned in the ESOP 2024 – EXECOM. 
Further, for better flexibility to the Company it is also being proposed to vary the Clause 6 - Vesting Period as mentioned below 
in vesting schedule for the options already granted/ to be granted in the future.  
The proposed amendments are not prejudicial to the interest of the current Option grantees and will not adversely affect any 
Options granted earlier under the original ESOP 2024- EXECOM.
Given that the approval of Members is being sought for increase in the number of Options, all the necessary details are being 
furnished herewith as per Part C of Schedule I of the SEBI (SBEB & SE) Regulations in terms of Regulation 6 of the SEBI (SBEB & 
SE) Regulations.  Consent of the Members is being sought by way of special resolutions pursuant to Regulations 6 and 7 of the 
SEBI (SBEB & SE) Regulations read with Section 62(1)(b) since any variation in the terms of any ESOP Scheme offered pursuant 
to an earlier resolution shall be approved by the Members by passing a special resolution. The special resolution set out at item 
no. 1 is to seek your approval for the said purpose. 
Further, as per Regulation 6(3)(c) of SEBI (SBEB & SE) Regulations approval of the Members is also required by way of separate 
shareholder resolution to extend the benefit under any ESOP Scheme to the employees of the subsidiaries of the Company 
including eligible Director(s) of the subsidiary companies. The special resolution set out at item no. 2 is to seek your approval
