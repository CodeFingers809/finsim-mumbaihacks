consolidated financial results for the quarter ended 30th September, 2025 (“Financial Results”) by the

of its subsidiary could not be completed due to certain issues requiring more clarification and discussion 
to finalize the said accounts. The said subsidiary had entered into settlement agreement with the 
Authorities as well as the Lenders, but certain important details and confirmation (including release of 
Security provided by the holding company) are yet to be received. In view of the above the finalization of 
accounts of the Company as well as the subsidiary is delayed 
The Company is making all the efforts to finalize / approve / publish the Financial Results and submit to

You are requested to take the same on record 
Yours truly,
