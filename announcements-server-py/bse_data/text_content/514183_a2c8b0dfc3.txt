BUSINESS UPDATE 
 
Manufacturing division: 
The manufacturing division delivered a robust performance in Q2 FY26, with overall sales 
rising 19% compared to the previous quarter. Acrylamide liquid recorded significant growth, 
driven by strong domestic demand, while acrylamide solid maintained steady volumes. 
Demand for N -methylol acrylamide was softer, reflecting seasonal factors, but stable 
consumption from key downstream sectors supported consistent momentum across the 
portfolio. 
 
1) Acrylamide 
 
Liquid 
In Q2 FY26, the company achieved a significant increase in market share amid stable 
domestic demand, while export volumes remained steady. Despite acrylonitrile prices easing 
from around $1,100/MT at the start of the quarter to about $1,000/MT by the end, the company 
maintained firm sales realizations through disciplined pricing strategies. Performance was 
further supported by the addition of new customers and the revival of previously inactive 
accounts, strengthening the company’s presence across key markets. 
 
Solid 
The company remains the sole global manufacturer of acrylamide solid outside China. Sales 
during Q2 FY26 were supported by regular domestic orders, even as the latter half of the 
quarter saw aggressive price competition from Chinese suppliers, resulting in  lower 
realizations. Despite these market pressures, the company sustained its established position 
through consistent supply and strong customer relationships. 
 
2) Polyacrylamide Liquid 
The company continued to serve the Morbi ceramic tile market during Q2 FY26, though growth 
remains constrained by local unorganized manufacturing. While demand was steady, the 
company has shifted its focus toward upstream acrylamide sales and is actively e xploring 
higher-value opportunities in polyacrylamide liquids for diversified applications —reflecting a 
strategic review of its long-term presence in this segment. 
3) N-Methylol Acrylamide 
Demand for N -methylol acrylamide was subdued in Q2 FY26 due to seasonal factors. The 
company maintained its position as an exclusive supplier to key domestic customers and 
expanded its customer base, creating a strong platform for future growth. 
 
Distribution division: 
The distribution business delivered a strong rebound in Q2 FY26, with turnover surging 60% 
over the previous quarter. This growth was driven by robust supply support from key principals 
and higher volumes of core products such as ethanolamines, meta -cresol, and purified 
isophthalic acid. Merchant export volumes also increased, supported by strategic alignment 
of offerings with customer requirements, reinforcing the company’s competitive positioning in 
key markets. 
 
 
 
 
OUTLOOK 
Manufacturing Division: 
The manufacturing segment is expected to deliver improved performance in the upcoming 
quarter. Acrylamide liquid exports are set to rise on the back of stronger international demand 
and broader market penetration, while N-methylol acrylamide demand is projected to recover 
from seasonal lows. Acrylamide solids should remain stable. Th e company is reviewing its 
polyacrylamide liquid binder business in Morbi and plans to focus on upstream acrylamide and 
new application areas. Alongside these strategic shifts, process efficiency initiatives and 
portfolio diversification are expected to drive growth and margin improvement, supported by 
favorable raw material prices. 
 
Distribution Division: 
For the upcoming quarter, the distribution business is expected to deliver steady performance 
despite certain supply constraints, which the company aims to mitigate through the addition of 
new products and principals. Strategic priorities include strengthening the team and expanding 
market reach to enhance resilience and growth. Demand from the US oil and gas sector is 
anticipated to remain stable. Additionally, a decision on the resorcinol anti -dumping case is 
expected during the quarter, and the company i s fully prepared to respond proactively, 
reinforcing its commitment to long-term competitiveness. 
 
PROJECTS AND EXPANSIONS 
The company’s polyacrylamide solid R&D program continues to advance, with the project 
expected to move into the piloting phase soon. The feasibility study for the specialty amines 
project in collaboration with Koei Chemicals is progressing well, and environmental clearance 
for the project is anticipated s oon. In parallel, other new product development opportunities 
and toll-manufacturing projects remain under active evaluation, underscoring the company’s 
commitment to innovation and long-term growth.
