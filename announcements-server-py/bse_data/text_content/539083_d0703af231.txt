Independent Auditors Review report on Standalone Unaudited Quarterly Financial Results of the 
Company pursuant to Regulations 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) 
To the Board of Directors of 
Inox Wind Limited 
1. We have reviewed the accompan ying Statement of unaudited standalone financial results of Inox 
Wind Limited (" the Company") for the quarter and six months ended September 30, 2025 ("the 
Stateme nt" ), being submitted by the compan y pu rsua nt to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the 
SEBl (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended). 
2. The Com pan y's Management is res pons ible for the preparation of the Statement in accordance with 
the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, (Ind AS 
34) "Interim Financial Reporting " prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 as 
amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. The Statement 
has been approved by the Company 's Board of Directors . Our responsibility is to express a 
conclusion on the Statemen t based on our review . 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Stand ard on Review 
Engagemen ts (SRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent 
Auditor of the Entity", issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India . This standa rd 
requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the 
financial statemen ts are free of material misstatement. A review is limited primaril y to inquiries of 
compan y personnel and anal ytical procedures applied to financial data and thu s pro vides less 
assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do not express an 
audit opinion. 
4. Based on our review conducted as abov e, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe 
that the accompanying statement of unaudited standalone financial results prepared in accor dance 
with applicable accounting standards and other recognized accounting practices and policies has 
not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements ) Regulations, 2015 including the manner in which it is to 
be disclosed , or that it contains any material misstatement. 
5 Emphasis of Matter 
a) We draw attention to Note 2 to the statement regarding invested funds in 6 SPVs. 
b) We draw attention to Note 3 to the statement regarding pending litigation matters with 
Court / Appell ate Authorities . 
c) We draw attention to Note 6 to the statement which describes that the suppl y / Commissioning 
of WTGs/ operation and maintenance services against certain contracts does n 
material adjustment on account of delays / machine availability, if any 
Our conclusion is not modified with respect to the above matters .

6. Other Matter 
a. Party balances in the form of trade receivables / payables / advances to vendors and other 
parties ( other than disputed parties) are subject to confirmation / reconciliation. Adjustments, if 
any will be accounted for on confirmation / reconciliation of the same, which in the opinion of 
the management will not have a material impact. 
b. During the previous year, the Company had written back the statutory liabilities of customs 
duties saved on import against expired EPCG licenses (including interest thereon) amounting 
to Rs.5,012 Lakh based on the extension of expired EPCG licenses under 
consideration / granted. Due to unascertainable outcomes for licenses under consideration and 
the significance of the balance to the financial statements as a whole and the involvement of 
estimates and judgement in the assessment, management believes that there will be no 
significant impact on the statements . 
Our conclusion is not modified with respect to the above matters.

STATEMENT OF STANDALONE UNAUDITED FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER AND HALF YEARLY ENDED 30 September, 2025 
Notes: 
1. The Standalone Financial Results for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025 have been reviewed by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting held on Novembe r 14, 2025. The Standalone Financial 
Results are prepared in accordance with th e Indian Accountin g Standards (Ind AS) as prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013. 
2. The Subsidiary Company (IGESL) incorporated 6 wholly-owned step down subsidiaries (hereafter referred to as SPVs) through its subsidiary compa ny {IGESL), through a request for selection (Rfs) process under the Solar Energy Corporati on of India 
(SECI) to set up wind farm projects . The company invested funds in th e SPVs through Inte r-Corporate deposits and also provided bank guarantees of Rs. 5,578 Lakh. The management believes that once th e project s are commissioned and subject t o 
pending regulatory matter s and operational performan ce improvement, the company will be able to recover the fund s from the SPVs and release the bank guarantees. However, as at September 30, 2025, the SPVs' project completion date had expired 
and applications for extensions has been rejected on 02.09.2024 and Bank Guarantee has been invoked and IGESL further file d the appeal before appellate authority (CERC) and same is pending with regulator s. In annual general meeting held on 
September 29, 2023 & September 29, 2023 of the Company and subsidiary company respectively approves that if the IGESL is unable to recover the funds provided as Inter -Corporate deposits and Bank Guarantee from the SPVs, lnox Wind Limited will 
bear the costs. Further during the previous year, investment in shareholding of 3 SPV has been sold by the IGESL. 
3. Due to unascertainable outcomes for pending litigation matters wit h Court/ Appellate Auth oritie s and significance of th e balance to the finan cial statements as a whole and the involvement of estimates and judg ement in the assessment which is 
being technical in nature, the management is of the opinion that the company will succeed in the appeals and there will not be any material impact on the statements on account of probable liability vis-a-vis the provisions already created in th e books. 
4. The Company is engaged in below mentio ned business activities, which is considered as a single business segment: 
a.Manufacturing of Wind Turbine Generators (WTG); 
b.Erection, procurement & commissioning services (EPC); 
c.Operations & Maintenance services (O&M); and 
d.Common infrastructure facility services for WTGs

5. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above , nothing 
has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in 
accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian 
Accounting Standard and other accounting principles generall y accepted in India, has not disclosed 
the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations , 2015, as amended, including the manner in which it is to 
be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatem ent. 
6. Emphasis of Matter 
a) We draw attention to Note 3 To the statement regarding pending litigation matters with 
Court / Appellate Authorities. 
b) We draw attention to Note 6 to the statement regarding invested funds in 6 SPVs. 
c) We draw attention to Note 7 of the statement which states that the Company has the policy to 
recognise revenue from operations & maintenance (O&M) over the period of the contract on a 
straight-line basis. Certain O&M services are to be billed by amounting to Rs.11,980 Lakh for 
which services have been rendered. On the basis of the contractual tenability, and progress of 
negotiations / discussions / arbitration / litigations, the company's management expects no 
material adjustments in the consolidated financial statements on account of any contractual 
obligation and taxes & interest thereon, if any. 
d) We draw attention to Note 8 to the statement which describes that supply / commissioning of 
WTGs/ operation & maintenance services against certain contracts does not require any 
material adjustment on account of delays / machine availability, if any . 
e) We draw attention to Not e 9 to the statement, which describes that the Group has inventory 
comprising work-in-progress inventory amounting to Rs.20,084 Lakh (as on March 31, 2025 
Rs.21,275 Lakh) for project development , erection & commissioning work and Common 
infrastructure facilities in different states. The consumption of the said inventory items is 
recorded based on a pre-defined Bill of Materials (BOM), which being technical in nature is 
relied upon by us. As certain respective State Governments have announced the policy on Wind 
Farm Development and accordingl y management believes that , the Group will be able to realise 
the Inventory . 
Our conclusion is not modified with respect to the above matters . 
7. Other Matter 
a. Party balances in the form of trade receivables / payable s/ advances to vendors and other parti es 
(other than disputed parties) are subject to confirmation / reconciliation . Adjustments, if any will 
be accounted for on confirmation / reconciliation of the same, which in the opinion of the 
management will not have a material impact. 
b. During the previous year, the Company had written back the statutory liabilities of customs 
duties saved on import against expired EPCG licenses (including interest thereon ) amounting 
to Rs.5,012 Lakh based on the extension of expired EPCG licenses under consideration / granted. 
Due to unascertainable outcomes for licenses under consideration and the significance of the 
balan ce to the financial statements as a whole and the involvement of estimates and judgem ent 
in the assessment , management believes that ther e will be no significant impact on the 
statem ents. 
c. .The consolidated Financial Results include the unaudited Financial Results of two subsidiaries , 
whose Financial Statements reflect Group 's shar e of Group's share of total revenue of Rs.1.63 
Lakh and Group's share of total net profit after tax of Rs. 0.22 Lakh for the quarter ended 
September 30, 2025, as consid ered in the consolidat ed Finan cial Result s. This unaud ited inte rim 
Financial Statements / financial information have been furnished to us by the Board of Director s 
and our opinion on the consolidated Financial Results , in so far as it relates to the amounts and 
disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries is based solely on such unaudited Finan cial 
Statements. In our opinion and according to the information and explanations given to us by 
the Board of Directors, this Financial Statement s/ finan cial information are not material to the 
Group . 
Our conclusion on the Statement is not modified with respect to the above matter .
