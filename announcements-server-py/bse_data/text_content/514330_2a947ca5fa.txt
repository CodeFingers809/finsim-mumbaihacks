Limited Review Report on unaudited quarterly standalone financial results of One Global Service 
Provider Limited pursuant to the Regulation 33 of SEBI (Listing Obligation and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulation, 2015 ("Listing Regulations") 
To the Board of Directors of 
One Global Service Provider Limited 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results of One Global 
Service Provider Limited ("the Company") for the quarter and half year ended on 30th

submitted by the company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of SEBI (Listing 
Obligation and Disclosure Requirements) Regulation, 2015 ("Listing Regulations") as 
amended. 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and approved by 
the Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial 
Reporting" ("Ind AS 34"), prescribed under section 133 of the companies Act, 2013 read with 
Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules,2015 as amended, read with 
circulars and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to 
issue a report on these financial statements based on our review, 
3. We conducted our review of the statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagement (SRE) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance 
as to whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. A review is limited 
primarily to inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial 
data and thus provides less assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing\has come to our attention that causes us 
to believe that the accompanying 5t‘atément\§ pared in accordance with applicable
