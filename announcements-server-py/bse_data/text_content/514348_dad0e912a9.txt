It is pertinent to mention here that at present, the Corporate Debtor is not fully operational 
entity and since from the initiation of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) 
most of the employees of the corporate debtor have left the company. Moreover, being a not 
fully operational, the corporate debtor doesn’t have sufficient funds  to make necessary the 
payments on time to the remaining employees. The same is pending for a long time now. 
 
Therefore, keeping in view the above circumstances and the current status of the Corporate 
Debtor i.e. CIRP, the Financial Results for the quarter and half year ended 30.09.2025 could 
not be finalized within the stipulated timelines. Consequently, the same is pending till date, 
due to factors which are beyond the control of the Resolution Professional and Corporate 
Debtor and despite proper planning and sincere efforts in this direction, we are not in a 
position to finalize the Financial Results for the quarter and half year ended 30.09.2025. 
 
It is pertinent to mention here that for the purpose of making the necessary applicable 
compliances, in terms of the Companies Act, 2013 along with the necessary compliances in 
terms of the applicable listing Regulations, we are trying our best efforts to finalize the 
Financial Results for the quarter and half year ended 30.09.2025 and will submit the same at 
the earliest. 
 
On the basis of the reasons as stated above, we again humbly request your good office to 
take the submission on record.  
 
We are happy to provide any further information and/or clarification as may be required 
by your good office. 
 
Thanking you, 
Yours faithfully, 
For WINSOME YARNS LIMITED 
(Under CIRP)
