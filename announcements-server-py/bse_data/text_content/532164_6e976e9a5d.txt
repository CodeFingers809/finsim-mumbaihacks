Limited Review Report on the Unaudited Standalone Financial Results for the Quarter 
ended 30th September and for the Half yearly ended 30th September, 2025. 
 
 
 
To, 
The Board of Directors 
Minolta Finance Limited 
 
 
We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Unaudited Standalone Finan cial results of 
Minolta Finance Limited (“the Company”) for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025. 
(“the Statement”) being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 
of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended.  
 
The Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's Manage ment and approved by the 
Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the Recognition and Measurement 
principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" ("Ind AS 
34"), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 as amended read with relevant rules 
issued thereunder and other Accounting Principles generally accepted in India as applicable to the 
Company. Our responsibility is to issue a report on the Statement based on our review. 
 
We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements 
(SRE) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the 
Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of i nterim financial 
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and 
accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially 
less in scope than an audit conducted in accord ance with Standards on Auditing and consequently 
does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that 
might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
 
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe 
that the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results prepared in accordance with 
applicable Indian Accounting Standards specified under Section 13 3 of the Companies Act, 2013 
read with relevant rules thereunder and other recognized accounting practices and policies has not 
disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing  
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 including the manner in which it is to 
be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement. 
 
 
Other Matters 
 
The company has reversed interest of Rs. 2.74 /- Crore on impaired asset  and which has led to 
increase in the  ECL provision which has caused in negative revenue during the quarter and Rs. 
4.86/- Crores (48.65%) of the net worth has been eroded during the quarter.
