Sub: Reply to the Clarification sought on Price Movement 
 
Dear Sir,  
 
We refer to your letter NSE/CM/Surveillance/16087, dated November 20 2025, regarding the movement in the 
price of the Company's securities. 
 
In this regard, we wish to inform you that there is no information or announcement (including any impending 
announcement) that the Company has withheld which, in our opinion, could reasonably impact the price or 
volume behaviour of the Company’s scrip. 
 
The Company has made all material disclosures, from time to time, in a timely and accurate manner, fully in 
compliance with Regulation 30 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“Listing Regulations”). 
 
Accordingly, we believe the recent significant movement in the price of the Company’s securities is purely 
market-driven, and the management is not aware of any internal factor or event that could have caused this 
volatility. 
 
We further reaffirm our commitment to transparency. As always, the Company will promptly inform the Exchange 
of any new price-sensitive information and make the same available on our website before it is made public. 
 
The same may please be taken on record and suitably disseminated to all the concerned. 
 
Thanking You,  
Yours Sincerely, 
For VL E- Governance & IT Solutions Limited
