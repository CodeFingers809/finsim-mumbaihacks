PRESS RELEASE 
Medi Assist Unveils Industry first AI Stack to Power a Borderless, Effortless, and Sustainable Health 
Benefits Ecosystem 
Mumbai, November 21, 2025: Medi Assist Healthcare Services Limited (“Medi Assist” or the “Company”), India’s largest 
technology-led health benefits administrator, today announced new AI-driven platforms that advance its vision of 
delivering Sustainable Benefits and Effortless Experience. These platforms are designed to make member interactions 
seamless while strengthening transparency, integrity, and long-term sustainability across the health benefits value 
chain. 
Over the past year, Medi Assist has accelerated its mission to make cashless healthcare truly seamless. Key outcomes 
include: 
● 15% of all discharges- over 4,00,000 members- now leaving the hospital before the final bill is generated. 
● 25% of its provider network (4,000+ hospitals) enabled next-generation cashless workflows. 
● 70% of total claim value now processed on cashless. 
● 85% of cashless claims digitally submitted, improving speed and reducing friction for all stakeholders. 
To further strengthen service delivery, Medi Assist announced two AI-powered platforms: 
● MAven Guard: a self-learning transaction integrity platform to detect, prevent, and deter fraud, waste, and 
abuse in real time. 
● MAgnum: a hospital enablement solution designed to let providers make cashless experience effortless for the 
members. 
Both solutions are built on Medi Assist’s comprehensive AI Stack, enabling the Company’s long-term ambition of making 
benefits sustainable and member experience effortless. 
Alongside the platform launches, Medi Assist and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) released a new report: “From 
Suspicion to Solution: A Strategic Approach to Health Insurance Fraud.” 
Key findings from the Raksha Report: 
● ₹8,000–10,000 crore in annual claim payouts leak due to Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA). 
● FWA inflates premiums, weakens insurer margins, and strains public resources. 
● Systemic issues- fragmented data, weak controls, misaligned incentives, fuel predictable leakage patterns and 
rising out-of-pocket expenditure. 
The report recommends a three-pillar framework of Prevention, Detection, and Deterrence, supported by: 
● A unified national codebook, 
● Governed GenAI and digital intelligence, 
● Real-time data exchange through ABDM and NHCX. 
These measures form a foundational roadmap toward the Government’s Viksit Bharat 2047 vision of “Insurance for All.” 
 
Satish Gidugu, CEO, Medi Assist said, “As India’s health system stands at an inflection point, the next decade will be 
defined by connected data and intelligent automation. At the heart of this transformation, both technology and AI are 
enabling insurers to proactively identify and reduce Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA); translating into direct cost savings 
and improved operational efficiencies. Each year, an estimated ₹8,000–10,000 crore of claim payouts leak through FWA, 
which erode insurer margins, inflate customer premiums, and strain public resources. Therefore, the need of the hour is 
to ensure that we forge digital trust and transparency into our health insurance infrastructure, thereby ensuring that 
care remains accessible, affordable, and accountable for all citizens.” 
Swayamjit Mishra, Managing Director and Partner, Core Member Financial Services and Technology Lead in Insurance, 
APAC, BCG said, “In India’s health insurance landscape, about 90% of claims are risk-free, while 2% are outright 
fraudulent and continue to be flagged today. The real opportunity lies in the remaining 8%, where inefficiencies and 
abuse can be addressed without inconveniencing genuine policyholders. Harnessing digital intelligence, interoperable 
platforms, and next-generation technology, we can systematically target this segment to reduce fraud leakage, improve 
trust, and unlock significant value across the ecosystem. These efforts can advance the government’s Insurance for All 
vision by nearly five years, strengthening India’s journey toward a transparent, technology-driven, and sustainable health 
insurance system”  
This initiative marks an important step in building a more accessible, efficient, and trusted health benefits ecosystem for 
India.
