Independent Auditor's Limited Review Report 
The Board of Directors 
SALASAR TECHNO ENGINEERING LIMITED 
Kh. No. 265, 281 to 288, Parsaun-Dasna, Jindal Nagar, 
Hapur-201015, UP 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of Unaudited Standalone Financial Results of M/$ 
SALASAR TECHNO ENGINEERING LIMITED (“the Company”) for the quarter ended on 30t 
September 2025 and year to date from April 01, 2025 to September 30, 2025(the "Statement") 
attached herewith, being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 
33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (‘the 
Regulation’) as amended, read with SEBI Circular No. CIR/CFD/CMDI/44/2019 dated March 29, 
2019 ('the Circular'). 
2. The preparation of the Statement in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles 
laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, (Ind AS 34) "Interim Financial Reporting" 
prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, as amended, read with relevant rules 
issued there under and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, read with the 
Circular is the responsibility of the Company's management and has been approved by the Board 
of Directors of the Company. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based 
on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This 
standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether 
the Statement is free of material misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of 
company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus provides less 
assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do not express an 
audit opinion. 
4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS') 
specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 as amended, read with relevant rules 
issued there under and other recognized accounting practices and policies has not disclosed the 
information required to be disclosed in terms of the Regulation, read with the Circular, including 
the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.

tax and total comprehensive income /loss of its associates and joint ventures for the quarter 
ended 30t September 2025 and year to date from April 01,2025 to September 30, 2025 
(the "Statement") attached herewith, being submitted by the Parent pursuant to the 
requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 as amended ('the Regulation'), read with SEBI Circular No. 
CIR/CFD/CMD1/44/2019 dated March 29, 2019 ('the Circular'). Attention is drawn to the 
fact that the consolidated figures for the corresponding quarter ended September 30, 2024, 
and corresponding period from April 01,2024 to September 30, 2024, as reported in these 
unaudited consolidated financial results have been approved by the Parent's Board of 
Directors, but have not been subjected to review. 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Parent's Management and approved by the 
Parent's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, (Ind AS 34) "Interim 
Financial Reporting" prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 as amended, 
read with relevant rules issued there under and other accounting principles generally accepted 
in India read with the Circular. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement 
based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410, "Review of interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons 
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review 
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance 
with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we 
would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. 
Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
We also performed procedures in accordance with the Circular issued by the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India under Regulation 33(8) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 as amended, to the extent applicable. 
4. The financial statement includes results of following entities:- 
S.No. | Company Name 
1 Salasar Techno Engineering Limited 
2 Wholly Owned Subsidiary 
- EMCLtd 
- Subsidiary Entity 
3. - Salasar REW JV 
- Salasar Adorus Infra LLP 
- STEL-ME-JV 
L - Salasar RVNL JV 
Joint Controlled Entities 
4. Sikka Salasar JV 
5. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above and 
based on the consideration of the review reports of other auditors referred to in paragraph 6 
below, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying 
Statement, prepared in accordance with recognition and measurement principles laid down in 
the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standard specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 
2013, as amended, read with relevant rules issued there under and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in 
terms of the Regulation, read with the Circular, including the manner in which it is to be 
disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement 
6. We did not review the interim financial results of above Six entities, included in the 
consolidated unaudited financial results, whose interim financial results reflect total assets of 
Rs 10946.63 Lakhs as at September 30, 2025 and share of total revenues of Rs 996.48 Lakhs 
and Rs 1720.14 lakhs, share of total net profit/(loss) after tax (including OCI) of Rs (55.76) 
Lakhs and Rs (25.85) lakhs, for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 and for the period 
from April 01, 2025 to September 30, 2025 respectively and net cash flow of Rs 336.66 lakhs 
for the period April 01, 2025 to September 30, 2025, as considered in the consolidated 
unaudited financial results. These interim financial results have not been audited/reviewed by 
other auditors and their financial statements have been certified by the management and our 
conclusion on the Statement, in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures in respect 
of these subsidiaries is based solely on such unaudited interim financial results certified by 
management and procedures performed by us as stated in paragraph 3 above. Our conclusion 
on the Statement is not modified in respect of the above matter
