Management Comment On Q2 FY26 Financial Performance
“We reported consolidated revenue of ₹156.43 Cr and net profit of ₹1.63 Cr in Q2 FY26, reflecting stable 
operational performance amid steady demand from infrastructure/ construction and our B to B customers from 
the stainless steel Space. The quarter demonstrated continued strength in stainless steel products, supported 
by efficiency gains from integrated manufacturing and disciplined cost control. Alongside, there has been 
steady ramping up of recommenced TMT bars facility. 
The Indian steel industry maintained positive momentum during the quarter, with strong government 
infrastructure spending and steady housing demand driving domestic consumption. However, global 
uncertainties and rising imports have been affecting the steel sector. Rising use of stainless steel in 
construction, railways, and renewable projects continues to create structural opportunities for value-added 
products, and is also slowly negating the impact of an excessive domestic supply created mainly on account of 
a couple of companies acquired under IBC, operating in similar space.
We remain focused on increasing the growth momentum of TMT bars by creating value creation by 
manufacturing steel through the recycling / circular economy route, which we believe will have greater demand 
preference going forward. Alongside, we remain focused in improving capacity utilisation, and enhancing 
margins through process optimisation / product mix improvement in the stainless steel space. With a robust 
balance sheet and a clear strategic roadmap, Rathi Steel and Power is well positioned for sustainable growth in 
the coming quarters.”

Rathi Steel And Power Limited at Glance
Incorporated in 1971, Rathi Steel And Power Limited (RSPL) has 
built over five decades of trust, quality, and reliability in steel 
manufacturing. The Company carries forward the renowned 
Rathi brand, a name in India’s steel industry since the 1940s.
RSPL operates a modern ~12.5-acre plant in Ghaziabad, 
strategically located near NCR. The facility has a steel melting 
capacity of ~85,000 TPA and rolling capacity of 200,000 TPA, 
providing scale, flexibility, and efficiency. It is also India’s only 
stainless-steel wire rod producer using direct billet charging 
technology, ensuring cost and energy savings.
The Company manufactures stainless steel billets, wire rods, 
and bright bars, with diversification into stainless steel rebars. 
Recent BIS certification for stainless steel rebars further 
strengthens its presence in the construction and infrastructure 
segment.
With a network of over several Dealer outlets across North India, 
RSPL has a strong distribution base. Backed by rising demand 
in infrastructure, railways, and coastal projects, the Company is 
well-positioned to scale its stainless-steel portfolio. Alongside, 
emerging demand of 550 / 550 D TMT grade from real estate 
majors across NCR region gives as an enormous opportunity to 
explore and deliver this product category.

Billets To Direct Rolling: Rathi’s Unique Advantage
Unique advantage
Most peers cannot do this as they don’t have melting & rolling in the same campus
Molten steel flows from the Continuous Casting Machine into billets.
These billets are carried hot on roller conveyors.
Instead of cooling & reheating, they move directly into the rolling mill 
for shaping into rebars & wire rods.
This process Minimizes yield losses from oxidation
Cuts carbon footprint with fewer reheat cycles
Cuts Down Net Energy (Fuel + Electricity) Cost
