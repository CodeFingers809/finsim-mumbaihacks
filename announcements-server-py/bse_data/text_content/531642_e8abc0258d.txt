Executive Summary: Consolidated Results 
Particulars (₹ Cr) Q2FY26 YoY Growth H1FY26 YoY Growth 
Revenue from Operations 3,482 31% 6,741 27% 
EBITDA 560 7% 1,215 6%

Domestic Volume Growth (%)  7%  8% 
International Business (% CCG)   20%  20% 
 
In Q2FY26, Revenue from Operations was at ₹3,482 crore, up 31% YoY, with underlying volume growth of 7% in the 
India business and constant currency growth of 2 0% in the international business. Consolidated and India revenue  
growth stood at multi-quarter highs. 
 
We witnessed st eady demand trends in India  during the quarter , except for the transitionary disruption  in trade 
channels ahead of the implementation of new GST rates in  the month of September. The India business revenues 
stood at ₹2,667 crores, up 35% YoY, aided by price hikes in core portfolios in response to sharp inflation in key input 
costs.  Offtake growth also remained strong, with more than 95% of the business gaining or sustaining market share 
and more than 75% of the business gaining or sustaining penetration, both on MAT basis. 
 
The international business maintained its robust growth trajectory with 2 0% constant currency growth, 
demonstrating its strong fundamentals and sustained growth potential.  
 
Gross margin contracted by ~ 810 bps YoY, on a particularly high base , as sharp inflation in key commodities  also 
exerted incremental pressure in this quarter . Despite these headwinds, we continued to invest meaningfully to 
strengthen the long -term equity of our franchises and accelerate portfolio diversification, with A&P spends rising 
19% YoY. Consequently, EBITDA was up 7%. EBITDA margin stood at 16.1%, down ~350 bps. PAT stood at ₹420 crore, 
up 8% YoY on a like-for-like basis, i.e. after adjusting for one-offs in the base quarter. Reported PAT was marginally 
lower on a YoY basis.  
 
Other highlights relating to the quarterly performance are as follows:  
• Parachute Rigids posted a volume decline of 3%, amidst headwinds posed by unprecedented hyperinflation in 
copra prices. After normalizing for ml-age reductions in lieu of price increases, the brand was flattish in volume 
terms. During the quarter, w e also rationed supplies to certain institutional customers to safeguard brand 
profitability. The brand consolidate d its market share on MAT basis , continuing to demonstrate resilience and 
pricing inelasticity, having absorbed multiple rounds of price hikes and ml -age reductions. Revenue growth for 
the brand stood at 59%. While copra prices remained rangebound after correcting ~15% from peak levels in early 
Q2, we expect Parachute to remain steady and reinforce its competitive edge on the back of its formidable brand 
strength and scaled back-end capabilities. 
• Value-Added Hair Oils  grew by 16% in value terms, marking the second consecutive quarter of double -digit 
growth and sustaining the pace of recovery  despite the aforesaid impact of the GST transition . The portfolio 
gained 150 bps in value market share on a MAT basis. We expect the franchise to maintain a healthy growth 
momentum over the near and medium term, supported by the strategic focus on the mid and premium 
segments of the portfolio, enhanced direct reach driven by Project SETU and the recent GST rate rationalization. 
• Saffola Edible Oils had a flattish quarter in volume terms amidst a relatively elevated pricing environment . The 
brand registered 19% revenue growth. During the quarter, the recently launched Saffola Cold Pressed Oils range 
witnessed a positive response on E-Com and Q-com platforms. On the occasion of World Heart Day, t he brand 
launched an AI-powered campaign titled 'Heart to Heart Talk', designed to raise awareness about heart health 
through personalized engagement.  
• Foods grew 12% YoY and crossed the ₹1100 crore mark in annualized run rate. Saffola Oats continued to gain 
market share on MAT basis, thereby retaining its position as the #1 Oats brand. True Elements and the plant -

based nutraceuticals portfolio of Plix maintained their strong growth momentum. Towards the quarter-end, 
True Elements expanded its ready-to-eat portfolio with high protein and fibre -rich offerings with the 
prototype of Protein Bars and Overnight Oats . Both offerings have been made  available in multiple exciting 
variants across online channels. 
• Premium Personal Care sustained its accelerated growth trajectory, led by the Digital-first portfolio. The Digital-
first portfolio, comprising Beardo, Just Herbs and the personal care portfolio of Plix, crossed the ₹1000 cr. ARR 
mark. 
• Copra and vegetable prices remained at elevated levels, while crude oil derivatives remained rangebound. We 
will continue to prioritize the expansion of our consumer franchises, while judiciously leveraging their pricing 
power. 
• In the International business, Bangladesh posted 22% CCG , maintaining its robust growth momentum on the 
back of the steady core business and scale up of new franchises . The fundamentals and medium -term growth 
outlook of the business remain intact. Vietnam grew 6% in CCG , exhibiting signs of a gradual recovery. MENA 
delivered 27% CCG, with both the Gulf region and Egypt recording strong growth. While South Africa recorded 
1% CCG, we are confident of a recovery in H2. NCD and Exports recorded 53% growth. 
Outlook 
The sector has witnessed stable demand trends during the quarter. We also expect consumer sentiment to gradually 
improve on the back of easing inflation, healthy crop outlook and policy stimulus. 
 
The recent GST rate rationalization announced by the Government is a welcome step toward s stimulating demand 
and long-term growth in the FMCG sector. ~30% of our India business has benefited from the GST rate rationalization. 
In line with the intent of the Government’s measures, we have passed on the benefits of revised GST rates to 
consumers across relevant product categories, reinforcing affordability and accessibility . 
 
Amidst this backdrop, we expect a steady growth trajectory in our core categories, despite input cost headwinds in 
the near term. This will be further aided by ongoing initiatives to support select General Trade (GT) channel partners 
and transformative expansion in our direct reach footprint under Project SETU. We also continue to draw confidence 
from healthy offtakes, penetration and market share gains across key portfolios. We will continue our focus on 
driving differential growth in our urban-centric and premium portfolios through the organized retail and ECommerce 
channels. Therefore, we expect to deliver consistent and competitive growth in the medium term by executing a 
more focused and channel-specific portfolio and SKU strategy. 
 
Sustained investment towards the accelerated scale up of our Foods and Premium Personal Care portfolios (incl. 
Digital-first businesses) has not only resulted in a visible shift in the revenue construct of the India business, but also 
enabled differential growth outcomes over the past few quarters. We will continue to aggressively diversify through 
these portfolios in line with our medium-term strategic priorities. We aim to grow Foods at 25%+ CAGR to ~8x of FY20 
revenues in FY27. We aim to scale th e Digital-first portfolio  to ~2.5x of FY24 ARR in FY27. We expect to unlock 
substantial growth levers in the digital -first franchises over the medium term through TAM expansion and driving 
brand penetration. The India revenue share of the Foods and Premium Personal Care portfolios stood at ~22% in  
H1FY26. Consequently, we expect the India revenue share of the Foods and Premium Personal Care portfolios to 
expand to ~25% by FY27. 
 
The rapid scale up of these portfolios has been accompanied by significant improvement in their profitability, 
resulting in their share of India Net Contribution (NC) moving to double digits (~5x of FY22 levels). This underscores 
the profitable and sustain able growth focus of the diversification strategy. We will continue to focus on driving 
consistent improvements in profitability as constituent franchises of the Foods and Digital -First portfolios attain 
critical mass. We have driven structural GM expansion of ~1000 bps in Foods over FY24 and FY25. We expect gradual 
improvement in gross and operating margins of the Foods portfolio as we scale up over the medium term. Among 
Digital-first brands, Beardo is likely to cross double -digit EBITDA margin this year, while Plix is delivering single-digit 
EBITDA margin. We aim to maintain the pace of scale up and achieve double -digit EBITDA margin in this portfolio in 
FY27.

The International business has navigated headwinds, including macroeconomic volatility and currency devaluation 
in select markets. While the Bangladesh and Vietnam businesses remain strong anchors, the robust momentum in 
the MENA and South Africa businesse s has visibly strengthened the revenue construct of the overall international 
business. This also reflects in the steadily reducing topline and bottomline dependence on the Bangladesh business. 
We have also made visible strides towards premiumisation of our portfolios across markets through innovation and 
expansion into premium personal care categories such as shampoos, skin care, hair styling/ care (ex -hair oils) and 
baby care. These portfolios have scaled at 24% CAGR over FY21 -25 period and we aim to deli ver 25%+ growth in the 
medium term. As a result, their revenue share in the International business rose from ~20% in FY21 to ~29% in FY25. 
We will continue to invest aggressively towards diversifying the portfolio, expanding the total addressable market 
and driving market share gains in each of the markets. We aim to maintain double -digit constant currency growth 
momentum in the International business over the medium term. 
 
We will also continue to scout for inorganic growth opportunities that offer meaningful potential to consolidate our 
competitive position in existing categories, expand the total addressable market in existing geographies or access 
markets of interest, thereby adding visible levers to drive long term value creation. 
 
In the first half of the fiscal year, we remained on course to achieve our strategic objectives outlined at the beginning 
of the year. The India business delivered high single digit volume growth, which was well-ahead of the sector, even 
amidst a particularly challenging input cost scenario . The scale-up in Foods  and Digital-First portfolio  has been 
broadly in line with aspiration s. The international business also strengthened its robust double -digit growth 
momentum. We remain committed to consistent investments towards brand building, in line with our strategic 
vision to strengthen the core and drive accelerated growth across new franchises both in India and overseas 
markets. We expect to sustain positive volume and revenue growth momentum in the quarters ahead, while driving 
resilient profit growth as margin headwinds ease gradually.  
 
Owing to the strengthening growth construct of the business, we maintain our aspiration to deliver double -digit 
revenue growth in the medium term through consistent outperformance vis -à-vis the category and market share 
gains in the India core portfolios, accelerated growth in the Foods and Premium Personal Care and double -digit 
constant currency growth in the International business. We also expect operating margin to inch up over the 
medium term, with leverage benefits as well as premiumisation of the port folios across both the India and 
International businesses.

In Q2FY26, Revenue from Operations was at ₹3,482 crore, up 31% YoY, with underlying volume growth of 
7% in the India business and constant currency growth of 20% in the international business. Consolidated 
and India revenue growth stood at multi-quarter highs.
We witnessed steady demand trends in India during the quarter, except for the transitionary disruption in 
trade channels ahead of the implementation of new GST rates in the month of September. The India 
business revenues stood at ₹2,667 crores, up 35% YoY, aided by price hikes in core portfolios in response to 
sharp inflation in key input costs.  Offtake growth also remained strong, with more than 95% of the business 
gaining or sustaining market share and more than 75% of the business gaining or sustaining penetration, 
both on MAT basis.
The international business maintained its robust growth trajectory with 20% constant currency growth, 
demonstrating its strong fundamentals and sustained growth potential. 
Gross margin contracted by ~810 bps YoY, on a particularly high base, as sharp inflation in key commodities 
exerted incremental pressure in this quarter. Despite these headwinds, we continued to invest meaningfully 
to strengthen the long-term equity of our franchises and accelerate portfolio diversification, with A&P 
spends rising 19% YoY. Consequently, EBITDA was up 7%. EBITDA margin stood at 16.1%, down ~350 bps. 
PAT stood at ₹420 crore, up 8% YoY on a like-for-like basis, i.e. after adjusting for one-offs in the base 
quarter. Reported PAT was marginally lower on a YoY basis. 
India Business
Parachute Rigids posted a volume decline of 3%, amidst headwinds posed by unprecedented hyperinflation 
in copra prices. After normalizing for ml-age reductions, the brand was flattish in volume terms. The brand 
consolidated its market share on MAT basis, continuing to demonstrate resilience and pricing inelasticity. 
Revenue growth for the brand stood at 59%. While copra prices remained rangebound after correcting 
~15% from peak levels in early Q2, we expect Parachute to remain steady and reinforce its competitive 
edge on the back of its formidable brand strength and scaled back-end capabilities.
Value-Added Hair Oils grew by 16% in value terms, marking the second consecutive quarter of double-digit 
growth. The portfolio gained 150 bps in value market share on a MAT basis. We expect the franchise to 
maintain a healthy growth momentum over the near and medium term.
Saffola Edible Oils had a flattish quarter in volume terms amidst a relatively elevated pricing environment. 
The brand registered 19% revenue growth. During the quarter, the recently launched Saffola Cold Pressed 
Oils range witnessed a positive response on E-Com and Q-com platforms. 
Foods grew 12% YoY and crossed the ₹1100 crore mark in annualized run rate. Saffola Oats continued to 
gain market share on MAT basis, thereby retaining its position as the #1 Oats brand. True Elements and the 
plant-based nutraceuticals portfolio of Plix maintained their strong growth momentum. Towards the 
quarter-end, True Elements expanded its ready-to-eat portfolio with high protein and fibre-rich offerings 
with the prototype of Protein Bars and Overnight Oats. Both offerings have been made available in multiple 
exciting variants across online channels.

Premium Personal Care sustained its accelerated growth trajectory, led by the Digital-first portfolio. The 
Digital-first portfolio, comprising Beardo, Just Herbs and the personal care portfolio of Plix, crossed the 
₹1000 cr. ARR mark.
International Business
Bangladesh posted 22% CCG, maintaining its robust growth momentum. The fundamentals and medium-
term growth outlook of the business remain intact. Vietnam grew 6% in CCG, exhibiting signs of a gradual 
recovery. MENA delivered 27% CCG, with both the Gulf region and Egypt recording strong growth. South 
Africa recorded 1% CCG and we are confident of a recovery in H2. NCD and Exports recorded 53% growth.
Outlook
The sector has witnessed stable demand trends during the quarter. We also expect consumer sentiment to 
gradually improve on the back of easing inflation, healthy crop outlook and policy stimulus.
The recent GST rate rationalization announced by the Government is a welcome step towards stimulating 
demand and long-term growth in the FMCG sector. ~30% of our India business has benefited from the GST 
rate rationalization. We have passed on the benefits of revised GST rates to consumers across relevant 
product categories, reinforcing affordability and accessibility.
We expect a steady growth trajectory in our core categories, despite input cost headwinds in the near term. 
This will be further aided by ongoing initiatives to support select General Trade (GT) channel partners and 
transformative expansion in our direct reach footprint under Project SETU. We will continue our focus on 
driving differential growth in our urban-centric and premium portfolios through the organized retail and 
ECommerce channels. 
We will continue to aggressively diversify through Foods and Premium Personal Care (incl. the Digital-first 
portfolio) in line with our medium-term strategic priorities. We aim to grow Foods at 25%+ CAGR to ~8x of 
FY20 revenues (~2x of FY24 revenues) in FY27. We aim to scale this portfolio to ~2.5x of FY24 ARR in FY27. 
We expect the India revenue share of the Foods and Premium Personal Care portfolios is expected to 
expand to ~25% by FY27. Among Digital-first brands, Beardo is likely to cross double-digit EBITDA margin 
this year, while Plix is delivering single-digit EBITDA margin. We aim to maintain the pace of scale up and 
achieve double-digit EBITDA margin in this portfolio in FY27.
The International business has navigated headwinds, including macroeconomic volatility and currency 
devaluation in select markets. We aim to maintain double-digit constant currency growth momentum in the 
International business over the medium term.
Saugata Gupta, MD & CEO commented, “Our performance in the first half of the year reflects the 
institutionalized resilience of our operating model amidst tough inflationary conditions. We have sustained 
healthy volume-led growth in the India business, coupled with market share and penetration gains across 
key portfolios. The core franchises have been stable despite steep input cost headwinds, while the new 
businesses continue to advance towards strategic aspirations. The International business has delivered 
stellar growth, reinforcing the breadth and balance of our portfolio. We expect to maintain healthy volume 
and revenue growth momentum in the quarters ahead, with profit growth gaining traction as margin 
pressures gradually abate.”
