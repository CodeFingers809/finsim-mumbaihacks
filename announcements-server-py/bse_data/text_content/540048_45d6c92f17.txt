Independent Auditor’s Limited Review report on unaudited consolidated financial results of the 
S.P. Apparels Limited for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025, under Regulations 33 of the 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015, as amended 
To the Board of Directors of S. P. Apparels Limited 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results of S. P. Apparels 
Limited (‘the Parent’) and its subsidiaries (the Parent and its subsidiaries together referred to as ‘the Group') and its 
share of net loss of the associate for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025, being submitted by the 
Parent pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the Securities Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (‘the Listing Regulations 2015'). 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Parent's Management and approved by the Parent's Board of 
Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian 
Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” (Ind AS - 34), as prescribed under Section 133 of Companies 
Act, 2013 and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to issue a report on the 
Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted cur review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagement (SRE) 2410, 
‘Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity’ issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate 
assurance as to whether the Statement is free of material misstatement. A review of interim financial information 
consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying 
analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance 
with the Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain reasonable assurance that we would 
become aware pf all significant matters that might have been identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an 
audit opinion. 
4. The Statement includes the results of the following entities: 
a. S.P. Apparels Limited (Parent) 
b. Crocodile Products Private Limited (Subsidiary) 
c. S.P. Apparels (UK) (P) Limited (Subsidiary)
