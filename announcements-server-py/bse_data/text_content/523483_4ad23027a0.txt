Limited Review Report on Unaudited OuarterlyIHalf Yearly Standalone 
Financial Results of Pacific Industries Limited pursuant to Regulation 33 of 
the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations,2015 
To The Board of Directors, 
1 Pacific Industries Limited 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of unaudited Standalone Financial 
Results of Pacific Industries Limited ('the Company') for the Quarter and Half year 
ended 3OLh September, 2025 ('the Statement'), being submitted by the Company 
pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 ofc the SEBI (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Iiegulations, 2015, as amended (the "Listing 
Iiegulations"). 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's management and 
approved by the Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the 
recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 
34 "Interim Financial Reporting" ("Ind AS 34"), prescribed under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India 
and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. Our responsibility 
is to issue a report on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on 
Review Engagements (SRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information 
Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform 
the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the Statement is free of 
material misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of company 
personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus provide less 
assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do 
not express an audit opinion. 
4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that 
causes us to believe that the accompanying statement of the unaudited standalone 
financial results prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement 
principles laid down in the applicable Indian accounting standards ('Ind AS') 
specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, read with relevant rules 
issued there under and other recognized accounting practices and policies generally
