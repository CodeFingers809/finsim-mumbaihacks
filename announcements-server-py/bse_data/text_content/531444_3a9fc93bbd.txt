Independent Auditor's Review Report on Unaudited Quarterly Financial Result s of the Company 
Pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015 (as amended) 
To 
The Board of Directors of 
Vardhman Concrete Litnited 
We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited standalone financial results ('the statement') of 
V ARDHMAN CONCRETE UMITED ('the Company) for the quarter ended 30th June , 2025. The Statement has been 
prepared by the Company pursuant to the requirem ents of Regulation 33 of the Securities and Exchange Board of 
India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) (,Listing Regulations'). 
The Statement, which is the responsibility of the Companys management and approved by the Board of Directors, has 
been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid aown in Indian Accounting 
Standard 34, (Ind AS 34) - "Interim Financial Reporting" prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 
('the Act'), and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and is in compliance with the presentation and 
disclosure requirements of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on 
the statement based on our review. 
We conducted our review of the Statement in accorda nce with the Standard on Review Engagement (SRE) 2410, 
"Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of 
persons responsible for financial and accounting matter s, and applying analytical and other review procedur es. A 
review is substan tially less in scope than an audit condu cted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified 
under section 143(10) of the Act, and consequently , does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become 
aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated above, nothing has come to our attention that 
causes us to believe that the accompanying statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement 
principles laid down in applicable Indian Accounting Standards ('Ind AS') 34, prescribed under Section 133 of the Act, 
and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the inform ation required to be 
disclosed in accordance with the requirem ents of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains 
any material misstatement .
