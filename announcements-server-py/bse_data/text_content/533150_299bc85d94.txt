PRESS RELEASE

Godrej Properties Crosses FY26 Annual Business Development Guidance 
with the acquisition of ~ 75-acre land parcel in Nagpur 
 The project will have an estimated revenue potential of ~ INR 755 crore* 
Godrej Properties Limited (GPL) (BSE: GODREJPRP), one of India’s leading real estate developers, 
today announced that it has surpassed its business development annual guidance of INR 20,000 for 
FY 26 with the acquisition of a ~ 75-acre land parcel in Nagpur. 
This is the third acquisition in the city over the past four years, underscoring its strong momentum and 
strategic focus on emerging growth corridors. The development on this land will comprise primarily 
plotted residential units and will offer an estimated saleable area of ~ 1.7 million square feet. 
The land parcel is strategically positioned near the Samruddhi Mahamarg and MIHAN SEZ, offering 
seamless connectivity to major corridors, including the Nagpur–Hyderabad Highway and Dr. 
Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport. The location benefits from a well-developed social and 
municipal ecosystem, with access to quality healthcare facilities, educational institutions, retail hubs, 
and entertainment options, making it an attractive destination for future development. 
Gaurav Pandey, MD & CEO, Godrej Properties, said, “Nagpur continues to strengthen its position 
as an important centre for infrastructure and industrial development, supported by improving 
connectivity and rising residential demand. This acquisition marks another significant step in our 
expansion journey as we look to strengthen our presence in emerging real estate markets across India. 
We look forward to developing a quality plotted township that creates long-term value for its residents, 
aligned with our evolving aspirations.” 
*On the basis of the current business assumptions.
