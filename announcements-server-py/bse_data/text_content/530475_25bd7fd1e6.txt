Management Analysis on H1FY26 Results 
Operational & Financial Highlights 
EPR credit amounting to INR 19.59 Cr is included in the H1 FY26 revenue, as against the EPR revenue of INR 21.61 Cr 
recorded in H1 FY25. 
Renewable Energy Solar Power has contributed savings of INR 1 Crore in H1FY26. 
Owing to startup costs, Mbodla Investments, South Africa recorded a loss of INR 73 lakh and is on track to break even by 
March 2026.

higher raw material costs. This impact is being mitigated through alternative feedstock options, with benefits expected from 
Q3 FY26 onwards. 
Revenue and tyre processing volumes saw a modest 3% and 2% dip respectively, reflecting management‟s strategic 
decision to prioritize margin expansion by selectively reducing sales of low-margin, commoditized products. 01

volume increase by the end of Q4 FY26. 
Allocated 3% of PAT towards R&D expenditure to become future ready.

Cost Saving Initiatives 
Renewable Energy Initiatives Raw Material Cost 
The company is expanding its existing 
renewable energy to more than 3x from 
1.23 MW to 4.48 MW. This will lead to the 
total savings of INR 3.9 Cr+ in FY26.

expected to be completed by the end of 
Q3FY26. 
 
Started sourcing solar energy from a 
third-party at our Chennai Plant under 
highly competitive terms. Plans to extend 
this sustainable and cost-effective 
initiative to other locations as well. 
Increasing our optionality on using 
different type of ELTs 
This will lead to 10-15% cost saving on 
raw material
