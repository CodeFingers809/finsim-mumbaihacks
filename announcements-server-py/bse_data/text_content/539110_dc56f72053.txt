6. The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of other information. 
The other information comprises the information included in the Company’s annual report, 
but does not include the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not 
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of 
our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. 
We have nothing to report in this regard. 
Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements 
7. The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of 
the Act with respect to the preparation of these financial statements that give a true and fair 
view of the financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, 
cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the Ind AS and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes 
maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and 
other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making 
judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for 
ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the 
preparation and presentation of the financial statement that give a true and fair view and 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
8. In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the 
Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management 
either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so. 
The Board of Directors are responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting 
process.

Auditors’ Responsibility for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
9. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue 
an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will 
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements. 
10.As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and 
maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
« Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
« Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to 
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 
143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the 
Company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls. 
. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management. 
« Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material ‘uncertainty exists, 
we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the 
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Qur 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to 
continue as a going concern.

« Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying 
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the financial statements that, 
individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable user of the financial statements may be influenced. We 
consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our 
audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any 
identified misstatements in the financial statements. 
11.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 
12.We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied 
with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them 
all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 
13.From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current 
period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in 
extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in 
our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected 
to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. 
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements 
14.As required by the Companies (Auditors’ Report) Order, 2020 (“the Order”) issued by the 
Central Government in terms of sub-section (11) of section 143 of the Act, we give in the 
Annexure B a statement on the matters specified in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Order, to the 
extent applicable. 
15. As required by Section 143(3) of the Act, we report that: 
a) We have sought and obtained all the information and explanations which to the best 
of our knowledge and belief were necessary for the purposes of our audit. 
b) In our opinion, proper books of account as required by law have been kept by the 
Company so far as it appears from our examination of those books.

Annexure A to Independent Auditors’ Report 
Referred to in paragraph 15(f) of the Independent Auditors’ Report of even date to the 
members of NORTHLINK FISCAL AND CAPITAL SERVICES LIMITED on the financial 
statements for the year ended March 31, 2025. 
Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to financial statements under 
Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) 
1. We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of 
NORTHLINK FISCAL AND CAPITAL SERVICES LIMITED (‘the Company”) as of March 
31, 2025 in conjunction with our audit of the financial statements of the Company for the 
year ended on that date. 
Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls 
2. The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal 
financial controls based on the internal control with reference to financial statements criteria 
established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated 
in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (‘the 
Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI"). These 
responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient 
conduct of its business, including adherence to company's policies, the safeguarding of its 
assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness 
of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as 
required under the Companies Act, 2013. 
Auditors’ Responsibility 
3. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with 
reference to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in 
accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing deemed to be 
prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to 
an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of internal financial controls 
and both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we 
comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects.

4. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of 
the internal financial controls system with reference to financial statements and their 
operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and 
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed 
risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgement, including the assessment 
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error. 
5. \We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls system with 
reference to financial reporting. 
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to financial statements. 
6. A company's internal financial control with reference to financial statements is a process 
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and 
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to 
financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the 
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;. (2) provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of 
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance 
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of 
the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to financial statements 
7. Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of 
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with 
reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate.

Annexure B to Independent Auditors’ Report 
Referred to in paragraph 14 of the Independent Auditors’ Report of even date to the 
members of NORTHLINK FISCAL AND CAPITAL SERVICES LIMITED on the financial 
statements for the year ended March 31, 2025. 
To the best of our information and according to the explanations provided to us by the 
Company and the books of account and records examined by us the normal course of audit 
we state that: 
i 
(a)(A) The Company has not provided proper records showing full particulars, including 
(b) 
quantitative details and situation, of Property, Plant and Equipment. 
(B) The Company did not own any intangible assets during the year under consideration. 
The Property, Plant and Equipment were not physically verified during the year by the 
Management which, in our opinion, should have been performed at a reasonable interval. 
Thus, we cannot comment whether material discrepancies were noticed as no such 
verification was performed. 
(c) Based on our examination of the property sale deed / transfer deed / conveyance deed 
(d) 
(e) 
provided to us we report that the title deeds of all immovable properties disclosed in the 
financial statements included under Property Plant and Equipment are held in the name of 
the Company as at the balance sheet date. No new immovable property has been 
procured by the company during the year. 
The Company has not revalued its Property, Plant and Equipment (including Right of Use 
assets) or intangible assets or both during the year. Consequently, the question of our 
commenting on whether the revaluation is based on the valuation by a Registered Valuer, 
or specifying the amount of change, if the change is 10% or more in the aggregate of the 
net carrying value.of each class of Property, Plant and Equipment (including Right of Use 
assets) or intangible assets does not arise. 
Based on information and explanations furnished to us, no proceedings have been 
initiated on or are pending against the Company for holding benami property under the 
Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988 (as amended in 2016) (formerly the 
Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 (45 of 1988)) and Rules made thereunder,
