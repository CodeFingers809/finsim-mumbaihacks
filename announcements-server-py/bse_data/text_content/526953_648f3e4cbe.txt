Dear Sir,
This  has  reference  to  your  email  ref  no.  L/SURV/ONL/PV/AA/  2025-2026  /  689  dated
20.11.2025 with regard to increase in volume of securities of Venus Remedies Limited.
In this regard we wish to inform you that Company has made all the necessary disclosures
in    accordance    with    Regulation    30    of   SEBl    (Listing    Obligations    and    Disclosure
