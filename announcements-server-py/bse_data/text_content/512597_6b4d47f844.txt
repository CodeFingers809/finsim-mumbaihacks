Dear Sir/Madam, 
 
Sub: Board Comments on Fines Levied by the Exchange 
 
This is with reference to the NSE Letter and BSE e-mail dated 29th August, 2025 regarding 
noncompliance of the provisions of Regulation 18(1) (constitution of the Audit committee) 
and 19(1)/(2) (constitution of the Nomination & Remuneration Committee) of the SEBI 
(LODR) Regulations, 2015 for the quarter ended on 30th June, 2025 and imposing fine on the 
Company for the same.  
 
This is to inform you that the matter of fines levied on the Company for the clerical error in 
reporting the Corporate Governance Report for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, was placed 
before the Board of Directors at its meeting held on 14th November, 2025. 
 
The Board has noted the fines and the waiver applications filed with your Exchange and 
reviewed the circumstances of the matter. The Board observed that: 
 
1. The Committees were validly constituted in accordance with SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015. 
 
2. The reporting error was purely procedural and corrected promptly upon receipt of 
the Stock Exchange notice. 
 
We are pleased to inform that the NSE has considered the Company’s request for waiver of 
fines and has granted the waiver for the fine imposed. We thank NSE for all their support. 
 
Yours sincerely, 
For Keynote Financial Services Limited 
 
 
 
Simran Kashela 
Company Secretary & Compliance Officer
