BUSINESS PERFORMANCE (H1FY26)
• Aerolloy Technologies (ATL):Aerolloy Technologies Limited delivered an Total Income growth of 47.6% YoY at Rs. 42.1 crores; EBITDA growth of 68.3% YoY
along with strong EBITDA margin of 51.3% during H1FY26.
• Trac Precision Solutions (UK):Trac Precision Solutions reported an EBITDA loss of GBP 0.137 mn (₹1.4 crores) in H1 FY26, largely stemming from some supply
chain challenges highlighted in the previous quarter, particularly in the sourcing of castings and subcontracted processes. Several corrective measures initiated
earlier are now in advanced stages of implementation, including production planning improvements. These actions are expected to progressively stabilize
operations and drive efficiency gains in the coming periods.

Capacity, Technology & Integration

PTC Industries Limited held the Lokarpan Ceremony of its Titanium & Superalloys Materials Plantat
the Strategic Materials Technology Complex in the Uttar Pradesh Defence Industrial Corridor, a major
milestone in India’s journey toward self-reliance in strategic materials manufacturing. The facility was
dedicated to the nation by theHonourable Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh, and theHonourable Chief
Minister of Uttar Pradesh Shri Yogi Adityanath, underscoring its national significance.

Aerolloy Technologies Limitedhas successfully commissioned an advancedVacuum Induction Melting
(VIM) facility for superalloy materials and large investment castings, and a state-of-the-artVacuum Arc
Remelting (VAR 400)furnace for titanium castings. These capabilities position PTC among a select group of
global companies able to produce some of the largest precision castings for aerospace and defence
applications, making it one of only two companies worldwidewith the ability to manufacture large
investment castings in both titanium alloys and superalloys.

Trac Precision Solutions has undertaken a strategic expansion programwith investments in advanced
Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) systems, deep-hole drilling machines, and automated storage
solutions. These enhancements will strengthen Trac’s capability to deliver complex turbine blade and vane
components for aero-engines and industrial gas turbines.

Orders, Program Wins & Strategic Partnerships

Received a Purchase Order from BrahMos Aerospace Private Limitedfor the supply of critical titanium castings. This Rs.
110 crore order will be executed over 24 months and highlights PTC’s advanced manufacturing capabilities for strategic
defence applications under the Government of India’s Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative.

Received a Purchase Order from Gas Turbine Research Establishment (GTRE), DRDO for Post-Cast Operations to
manufacture Single Crystal ‘Ready-to-Fit’ Turbine Blades. This marks a historic milestone as the first time any Indian company
has been entrusted with these highly complex components, a capability possessed by only a handful of organisations globally.

Trac Precision Solutions entered into a strategic partnership with Coolbrookto supply precision machined and cast
components for its RotoDynamic Heater technology. This multi-million-pound program represents a significant diversification
into clean technology and is expected to generate substantial long-term revenue as global deployment scales.

Signed a MoU with Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) to establish a Joint Venture for the design, development, and
manufacture of complete propulsion systems, guided bombs, and aero-engines for missiles, UAVs and loitering munitions,

Chairman & Managing Director
Sachin Agarwal
Chairman & Managing Director 
We delivered a strong performance in Q2 FY26 with 64% YoY revenue growth, and an impressive 83% YoY growth in H1
FY26. This robust growth in revenue reflects the momentum across our businesses. While EBITDA margins were temporarily
impacted by the consolidation of Trac Precision Solutions, we see this as a short-term effect. As integration progresses and
operationalsynergiestakehold,marginsareexpected toimprove.
This quarter also marks a significant milestone in our journey to build globally rare capabilities in titanium and superalloy
manufacturing. Wehave successfully commissioned the VAR 400 furnacewith capability to manufacture some of the largest
Titanium castings in the world and the Vacuum Induction Melting (VIM) furnace for Superalloy Materials and large
Investment Castings. These capabilities, combined with our other capabilities will position PTC among a select group of
global companies offering integrated solutions from materials to complex castings for next-generation aero-engines and
strategic platforms. Our progress is further validated by recent strategic wins, including an order from BrahMos Aerospace
for critical titanium castings, a purchase order from GTRE (DRDO) for Single Crystal ‘Ready-to-Fit’ Turbine Blades, a first for
an Indian company. Additionally, our UK subsidiary, Trac Precision Solutions, has entered into a multi-million-pound
partnership with Coolbrook to supply components for RotoDynamic Heater technology, opening a new growth avenue in
clean-tech.
Looking ahead, our continued investments in advanced machining systems, deep-hole drilling, and digital storage, along
with downstream titanium and superalloy processing, will drive margin recovery and operational efficiency. As our facilities
ramp up and customer approvals conclude, we remain committed to building an integrated, future-ready ecosystem that
creates sustainablelong-termvalue forall stakeholders.”
