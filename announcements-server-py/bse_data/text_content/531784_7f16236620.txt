Independent Auditor's Review Report on Unaudited Quarterly Financial Results of KCL Infra 
Projects Limited Pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) 
 
To,  
The Board of Directors 
KCL Infra Projects Limited 
  
        Opinion  
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Unaudited Financial Results of KCL Infra 
Projects Limited (“the Company”) for the six monthly and  Quarter ended September 30, 2025 
(“the Statement”), being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 
33 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Reg ulations, 2015 as amended, 
including relevant circulars issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. 
 
2. This Statement, which is responsibility of the Company’s Management and approved by the 
Board of Directors, has been compiled from the related interim condensed financial statements 
which has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid 
down in  Indian Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” ( Ind AS 34), prescribed 
under the Section 133 of the Companies Act 2013 (‘the Act’)  and other accounting pri nciples 
generally accepted in India and is in compliance with presentation and disclosure requirements 
of Regulation 33 of SEBI(Listing Obligation and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations,  2015(as 
amended) including relevant circulars issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. Our 
responsibility is to issue a conclusion on the Statement based on our review.  
 
3. We conducted our review of the statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagement (SRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Infor mation Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India . A 
review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons 
responsible for financial and accounting matt ers, and applying analytical and other review 
procedures. A review is substanti ally less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with 
Standard on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act, and consequently, does not 
enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might 
be identified in an audit. Accordingly we do not express an audit opinion. 
 
4. We also performed procedures in accordance with the  SEBI circular CIR/CFD/CMD1/44/2019 
DATED 29 March 2019  issued by SEBI under Regulation 33 (8) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 as amended to the extent applicable.

           Conclusion 
 
Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above, 
nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement 
has not been prepared in all material respects in accordance with the recogni tion and 
measurement laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standard and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India and has not disclosed the information required to be 
disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and  Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015 as amended including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it 
contains any material misstatement.
