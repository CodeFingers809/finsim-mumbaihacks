NRL Capacity Ramp-Up: Capacity to be ramped-up from 3 MMT to 9MMT in a 
phased manner to ensure seamless transition to expanded operations
FY26 • CDU/VDU shall be ready for commissioning (Oil In) by Dec’25 along with certain utility packages
• PNCPL (Paradip-Numaligarh Crude Pipeline), transporting imported crude to NRL to be commissioned in Q4FY26
FY27 • Expanded refinery capacity of 6MMT to operate at ~40% capacity utilization for H2FY27. Motor Spirit Block and Diesel 
Hydrotreater units to be commissioned by Sept’26
FY28 • Expanded refinery capacity of 6MMT to operate at 80% capacity utilization for full year

GRM Impact: Net adverse impact of ~$2/ barrel on GRM→ Higher petrochemical integration, and favorable pricing on exports to support GRM, 
while import of heavier sour crude, Increase of MS share with lower crack spreads, and loss of excise benefit on exports to weight down GRM
