Paras Savla: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.  It's a pleasure to connect with all of 
you as we discuss our performance for the 2nd Quarter and First Half of FY26. I trust you had a 
chance to go through our Results, Press Release and Investor Presentation available on the 
company's website and Stock Exchanges. 
I am joined by our Director Finance and CFO – Mr. Rohan Shah, who will share a detailed 
Financial Overview after my address.  
The Quarter 2 and First Half of FY26 has been another period of outstan ding performance and 
strong execution for Deep Industries. India's oil and gas sector continues to witness renewed 
momentum backed by the government's strong push for domestic exploration, production 
growth and a long -term energy security. This ongoing act ivity has created a positive business 
environment and we continue to benefit from it as one of the key integrated service providers 
in the country.  Deep Industries has maintained its growth trajectory by enhancing operational 
efficiency, deploying assets e ffectively and deepening engagement with mar quee clients in 
both PSUs and private segments.  
We at Deep Industries have always believed in providing value -added services to our clients. 
Value-added services can give one -stop solution to the client and it reduces costs and saves 
time for them with efficient output.  A value -added service for us has become a margin -
assertive opportunity and gives us flexibility to perform in one more efficient manner.  
Our production enhancement contract at Raja hmundry field is progressing well with stable 
production achieved and further optimization measures underway. We expect this project to 
deliver incremental contributions to our output in the coming quarters.  In the midstream 
segment, we continue to operate one of India' s largest fleet s of gas compression units while 
also expanding our footprint in modular gas processing systems under the Lease -Operate-
Maintain model. We are seeing increasing interest in these solutions from PSU clients 
operating in challenging gas fields  where reliability and cost efficiencies are critical. As of 
now, our order book stands strong at around Rs 3,050 odd crores providing long-term revenue 
visibility and reaffirming our healthy business pipeline.

Looking ahead, our focus for the remainder of FY26 will be on; 1. Achieving the highest levels 
of operational efficiency and safety across all our sites . 2. Strengthening our participation in 
production enhancement and unconventional resource development . 3. Scaling up the 
deployment of charter hiring of entire gas processing facilities and 4. Pursuing selective value -
accuracy opportunities that enhance our service offerings and profitability. 
The first half has laid a solid foundation for the remainder for the year. With a robust project 
pipeline, a favorable policy environment, and strong execution capabilities, we are well 
positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities in India's energy sector.  We remain 
committed to sustainable growth and long -term value creation for all our stakeholders. W ith 
that, I now invite Mr. Rohan Shah to present the financial highlight for Q uarter 2 and half-year 
FY26. Thank you. 
Rohan Shah: Thank you, Paras bhai. Investor friends, thank you for joining the call today. 
I am pleased to share with you another strong q uarterly and half -yearly performance of Deep 
Industries Limited. All comparisons are on a year -on-year basis, which would provide a fair 
evaluation. For the quarter ended September 30 th 2025, revenue for Q2 FY26 stood at Rs. 221 
crores up by 69.2% year -on-year. Good control over operating costs and enhanced utilization 
of key assets helped us post EBITDA of Rs. 112.9 crores in Q2 FY26, reflecting 74.7% YOY 
growth with an EBITDA margin of 46.6%. We continued to maintain healthy EBITDA 
margins in the range of  45%-46%, ensuring strong operating cash generation to support our 
future growth trajectory.  
Net profit for the quarter was Rs.  71.2 crores , up by 71.4% YOY. Now on half year ended 
September 30th 2025, revenue for H1 FY26 stood at Rs. 420.5 crores , registering 65.5% YOY 
growth. EBITDA for H1 FY26 was Rs. 207.9 crores , up by 64.9% YOY with an average 
EBITDA margin of 45.7%. PAT for H1 FY26 was Rs. 132.9 crores, showing 65.6% YOY 
growth. As on date, our order book stood at Rs. 3 ,050 crores, providing  strong revenue 
visibility for coming quarters. 
With this I now open the forum for questions and answers. Thank you. 
Moderator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question 
comes from the line of Sudeep Anand from Systematix Group. Please go ahead. 
Sudeep Anand: Good morning, sir and many congratulations for a very good set of numbers. Few questions, 
we will start with the rig business. What is the current status of the couple of rigs which is 
likely to join the fleet in H2 and how do we see the tendering process and any guidance on rig 
addition for H2 and FY27?  
 Deep Industries Limited 
November 10, 2025 
 
 Page 4 of 18 
Rohan Shah: Our couple of rigs are on the way from China to our sites and we are expecting them to get it 
deployed one is December and one in Q4. Wi th regards to new opportunities, we have bidded 
quite a few tenders for rigs and we are waiting for their [inaudible 0:08:38]  
Sudeep Anand: In terms of PEC, what was the gas price realization during the quarter  and what was  the 
average production level? 
Rohan Shah: Sorry, I just missed that. 
Sudeep Anand: Under the production enhancement contract, what was the gas price volume and the 
realization?  
Rohan Shah: Gas price realized was around $7.5 MMBTU and average volume would be somewhere around 
1,70,000 cubic meter a day. 
Sudeep Anand: That's it from my side, sir. Thank you. 
Moderator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Akhilesh Rawat, from R idhanta Vision 
Private Limited. Please go ahead. 
Akhilesh Rawat: First of all, sir, I want to congratulate on a good set of numbers. So, I have only one question. 
So, as an investor presentation, you have mentioned that your order book has crossed Rs. 3,050 
crores as of November , 2025. So, growing at 53% CAGR since financial year 2022. So, what 
proportion of this order book is expected to convert into revenue over the next 12  to 24 
months? And how should we think about the mix between high margin segments and like 
charter higher gas processing facilities versus drilling and offshore services? 
Rohan Shah: So, out of this total order book of more than Rs. 3 ,050 crores, almost Rs. +1,300 crores is for a 
production enhancement contract, which is for 15 years.  So, if we remove that, more than Rs. 
1,650 crores of order book is executable over 2.5 years. 
Akhilesh Rawat: This ONGC production enhancement contract, as you mentioned in PPT is Rs. 1,402 crores for 
15 years. And as you mentioned that majority of the revenue will come in first 10 years. So, 
can you please quantify like expected EBITDA margin range for this project and explain like 
how the revenue ramp up will occur over financial year ‘26 to financial year ‘28? 
Rohan Shah: So, we are expecting on full year basis revenue from this particular co ntract to the tune of Rs. 
140 to Rs. 150 crores from next financial year onwards.  And the margins we are expecting out 
of this contract in range of around 50% kind of EBITDA. 
Akhilesh Rawat: Thank you. That's it from my side. All the best for upcoming quarters. 
Rohan Shah: Thank you.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of D haval Popat from Choice International 
Limited. Please go ahead.  
Dhaval Popat: Thank you for the opportunity and congratulations on a very good set of numbers. A follow up 
on the question that was just asked regarding the Rajahmundry field operations ramp up, how 
these are panning out and what should we expect in the rest half of the year for this field, as in 
should the revenues be in the line of about Rs. 35 crores or so?  That is my first question. And 
second question I have is around if the oil prices dip from here on for the next year, what is the 
impact on the rate chart that we could see and how much EBITDA margins could be impacted 
on the back of this? 
Rohan Shah: So, from production enhancement contract, since we have now started crossing over baseline, 
so revenue from H2, we can expect to the tune of around Rs. (+35) crores and maybe even 
more. And from next year onwards on full year basis, it should be more than Rs.  140 crores 
kind of revenue on full year basis. To answer to your second question of crude oil price, I 
believe our majority of contracts are fixed price contract a nd they are long term contracts of 3 
years. So largely movement in crude oil price is not affecting our services business because 
even if crude oil price is higher or lower, the activity of production is continuously going on in 
India being energy deficien t country. And so, we have seen in last 20 -25 years, this crude oil 
price movement generally not affecting us much. 
Dhaval Popat: Thank you for answering my questions.  
Rohan Shah: Thank you. 
Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sudh ir B heda from B heda family office. 
Please go ahead. 
Sudhir Bheda: Good morning and hearty congratulations to entire Deep team for delivering the exceptional 
result quarter after quarter. So, my hearty congratulations to entire Deep team. Sir, two 
questions. Just wanted to understand about the other income part. So, is this kind of sustainable 
income or how we should look into it going forward to second half and next year? 
Rohan Shah: Other income largely consists of interest and mutual fund M2M gro wth and to certain extent it 
is revaluation on foreign currency valuation on your overseas receivables. So more or less we 
believe this kind of other income would continue in next half as well. 
Sudhir Bheda: And sir, just wanted to understand, see we have all time high order book and then just wanted 
to understand order pipeline for next 12 months. How much we will bid and what is the 
winning ratio over there so we can have a fair idea about the next year's growth? 
Paras Savla: So, we have a bidding pipeline close to 700 odd crores. How much of that would get converted 
it is only the matter of time but out of our experience we believe it would be good substantial 
numbers that can get converted. But having said that, that is not only the bidding pipeline, 
 Deep Industries Limited 
November 10, 2025 
 
 Page 6 of 18 
there is a constant bidding happening.  So, every month -on-month we keep on bidding new 
projects and therefore these numbers are a little dynamic. They keep on increasing. So , as we 
speak it's 700 crores but it has a high potential to grow these numbers in the next quarters. 
Sudhir Bheda: And lastly sir, just wanted to understand, we will employ two rigs in next two quarters and 
then next year also we will get the full revenue from Dolphin also. So, what is the next year's 
outlook in terms of growth if you can throw some light on that. 
Rohan Shah: Yes, so as you rightly mentioned these rigs which are being deployed in current year…. 
Sudhir Bheda: And also, production enhancement, so, these three growth drivers would be the production 
enhancement, additional rigs and then Dolphin. So then on these three accounts what would be 
the growth outlook for next year. 
Rohan Shah: Correct, so production enhan cement contract and new addition of rigs which have not 
contributed on full year basis in current financial year, they would start contributing revenue 
on full year basis from next financial year onwards. And of course, Dolphin will also have full 
year revenue from next financial year onwards. So, all put together we are expecting growth of 
another 35% to 38% kind of growth on year-on-year basis in next financial year as well. 
Sudhir Bheda: That's good. Thank you for your time and all the best.  
Rohan Shah: Thank you. 
Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of A aryan Doshi from D ivitiae Investments. 
Please go ahead. 
Aaryan Doshi: Congratulations on the very good results. I just wanted to ask one question. So, the margins 
have been stable around 43% to 45% over the last few quarters. Even the PEC contracts on the 
Dolphin offshore, the margins improvement like the 45% number will increase or the number 
would be same in the next quarter. And also, the revenue growth rate, the numbers would be 
same or the number would be increased? 
Rohan Shah: So, margin we believe it should improve a bit going forward and we are expecting our 
EBITDA margins to grow upwards beyond 45% in coming quarters. With regard s to revenue, 
yes, it would be a little higher than the current quarters because the new assets would start 
adding revenue in coming quarters and it will give a growth over previous quarters. 
Aaryan Doshi: Thank you so much sir. This was the only question. 
Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sidharta from Capri Global  Housing Finance. 
Please go ahead. 
 Deep Industries Limited 
November 10, 2025 
 
 Page 7 of 18 
Sidharta: Congratulations for the good set of results. So, the only question is in the last con-call you 
have intended going for some fundraise. So, can you give some color on that? 
Rohan Shah: So, we have taken all required approvals for fundraise and we are, we have done some non -
deal roadshows as well. So, we are waiting for just a perfect time to get into it. 
Sidharta: So what's the quantum of the fundraise you are looking at? 
Rohan Shah: So, it is around (+300) crores kind of quantum which we are looking at it. 
Sidharta: So can we expect this to be closed by the end of financial year, calendar year or financial year? 
Rohan Shah: Yes, looking forward to it. 
Sidharta: Thank you sir. 
Moderator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Nirvana Laha from Badrinath Holdings.  
Please go ahead. 
Nirvana Laha: Thanks for the opportunity, sir. Congrats on a great set of results. Sir, you commented on the 
other income I missed that. Can you please repeat that? 
Rohan Shah: So other income consists of interest income, then mutual fund income and mark -to-market of 
funds as well as some overseas receivables on foreign currency fluctuation. 
Nirvana Laha: None of that pertains to recovery of receivables, right? It's just the amount of receivables 
because of FOREX gain? 
Rohan Shah: Yes, FOREX gain, fluctuation, correct. 
Nirvana Laha: And you said this is expected to continue for the next two quarters. Did I hear you right? Like, 
why would you expect so?  Because we have never been at these levels of other income in the 
past. It's been less than crores. 
Rohan Shah: So, interest and mutual fund income would definitely be continue to go in coming quarters as 
well. Of course, I cannot comment on revaluation gain on foreign currency. 
Nirvana Laha: And if you can give some comment on the standalone growth.  So actually, before this, we 
were also growing qui te fast, like by 30 %-40%. But for the last two quarters, we have now 
started showing 60 % to 70% YoY growth in standalone. So what projects are actually 
contributing to this? Like, why has the growth gone up to 50 %-60% now? Which new projects 
are contributing? Because I don't think the production enhancement has started. 
 Deep Industries Limited 
November 10, 2025 
 
 Page 8 of 18 
Rohan Shah: No, the production enhancement  has of course started, but with a lower amount because it is 
just an initial phase. In addition to that, we have added quite a few assets  in this year. Like, in 
last 8 months, we have added six more rigs. I think those assets, when it comes on operation, it 
will start adding into your top line. And in this entire gas processing services also, we have 
added one project. I think in the last t wo quarters, there are sizable projects, which has been 
added into our operating fleet and that has given growth on revenue. 
Nirvana Laha: Got it, sir. So, you expect for H2 also, this kind of YoY standalone to continue 60% kind of 
growth? 
Rohan Shah: Yes, so H2 would continue the momentum and we are expecting H2 would have a growth over 
H1. 
Nirvana Laha: That's great to hear, sir. Final question on Prabha, is the full depreciation run rate in for the 
barge from this quarter? There's been a sharp jump in Dolphin depreciation. Is the full amount 
quarterly run rate, is it sufficient or can it increase further from here? 
Rohan Shah: The estimated life for depreciation we have considered as 15 years. And so based on that, this 
depreciation would start kicking in. So, in last quarter for some part, it was under capital work 
in progress. And so last quarter, depreciation would have been lower than the current quarter. 
Nirvana Laha: So, for 4 crores of depreciation, you expect to continue or will it increase to like 5 -6 in the 
coming quarter? 
Rohan Shah: It would be more or less in that range. If we'll add further some addition to that asse t, then it 
can increase. Otherwise, it would be in the same line here. 
Nirvana Laha: All right, sir. Congratulations on great execution. Wish you all the best. Thank you.  
Rohan Shah: Thank you. 
Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of A nkur Savar iya, an individual investor. 
Please go ahead. 
Ankur Savariya: Good morning, sir. I congratulate you on a very good set of numbers that you have given again 
and again. My first question is regarding the court case with ON GC. What is the status of that 
case? 
Rohan Shah: The arbitration one you are referring to? 
Ankur Savariya: Yes, you were expecting that to end in 2 -3 months, but I think for last 6 months, there is no 
update regarding the same. 
 Deep Industries Limited 
November 10, 2025 
 
 Page 9 of 18 
Rohan Shah: So that is going on. And so, we cannot comment on timeline when particularly it is a court 
matter. But we are quite hopeful it should complete it soon. 
Ankur Savariya: And regarding the receivables of Kandla, is there any positive update on that? 
Rohan Shah: So, currently, we are sti ll under an evaluation stage. So, as of now, there is no recovery from 
last quarter till now. But yes, we are hopeful and we have started following up with them.  So, 
we believe some good news should come in coming quarters. 
Ankur Savariya: And production enhancement contract, since it has been about two quarters. So, do you think 
that it is going on well and we can get more such contracts from ONGC? 
Paras Savla: Yes, we expect it. So, there will be various bidding rounds coming up. And if that happens, 
definitely, we will be bidding for it. And hopefully, we should win some of those projects. 
Ankur Savariya: That's it from my side. Congratulations once again, sir. Thanks for answering my questions. 
Rohan Shah: Thank you. 
Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rahil from Sapphire Capital. Please go ahead. 
Rahil S: Good morning. So, firstly, you  have given this consolidated basis guidance for next year.  For 
FY26, what can we pencil in terms of growth? The 35% run rate should continue? 
Rohan Shah: Yes, it should be. I believe it should be higher than 35%. 
Rahil S: For FY26, you are saying, right? 
Rohan Shah: Correct. 
Rahil S: But then, given the PEC to kick in more revenue from next year and the new assets to 
contribute, then next year should also be (+40%), correct, on a consolidated level? 
Rohan Shah: Yes, so, we are expecting next year also more than 35%. How much over and above 35% we  
will be able to achieve, I think that time will definitely give us the idea.  But for sure, minimum 
35%. 
Rahil S: And we have seen the last two quarters with a positive bottom line. Will this continue for the 
rest of the year and ahead? 
Rohan Shah: Yes. Of course. 
Rahil S: So, expecting this year to be profitable. Thank you so much and all the best. 
 Deep Industries Limited 
November 10, 2025 
 
 Page 10 of 18 
Rohan Shah: So, in fact, last year also, it was just a non -cash entry which has resulted into loss. Otherwise, 
it was in profit only. 
Rahil S: Got it. Thank you. 
Rohan Shah: Thank You. 
Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Gaurav Sachdeva f rom Saja g Securities. 
Please go ahead. 
Gaurav Sachdeva: Sir, we were looking to add some more assets in the Dolphin offshore like vessels and other 
assets. So, when will we add that, vessels and all that? 
Rohan Shah: Yes, we have identified and shortlisted  few assets and we are working on it once we will be 
able to tie up those assets for contracts. We will go for acquisition. So,  we are on quite 
advanced stage of that part. 
Gaurav Sachdeva: And for how many years we can look such 30% to 40% growth on a consol level? 
Rohan Shah: See, based on existing order book, we believe for next 2 years, this kind of growth is clearly 
visible. Depending on further addition to this order book, we can continue the momentum 
beyond 2 years as well. 
Gaurav Sachdeva: And regarding production enhancement, these contracts, when do you think that ONGC will, 
give such more contracts? 
Rohan Shah: So, their internal back-office work is going on. So, we cannot comment on the exact timeline 
when they will come up with such mor e tenders. But it is very much expected in coming 
quarters. 
Gaurav Sachdeva: Thank you, sir. 
Rohan Shah: Thank you. 
Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Deepak Kumar from IG Family Office. Please 
go ahead. 
Deepak Kumar:  Thank you fo r the opportunity.  So, my question is to the tune of production enhancement 
contract. Have they started the execution? 
Rohan Shah: Yes. It has started execution. I think we have taken over that block in the month of April only.  
And we have started our work  operations from April onwards and it is now up in producing as 
per our expectation. 
 Deep Industries Limited 
November 10, 2025 
 
 Page 11 of 18 
Participant: I think our share has to come when we produce more than 1.5 PPM a day. So, how has been 
the experience till now? 
Rohan Shah: Yes, we have crossed the baseline. And this production is increasing above baseline, which is 
progressing as per our expectation. And we believe from next financial year on full year basis; 
we would be earning as per our expectation. 
Participant: And how is the price realization now?  
Rohan Shah: So, price realization , currently it is in line with what ONGC used to sell. And with higher 
quantity coming up, we may take a call to sell at spot as well with higher price.  But these 
decisions are dynamic and depending on the volume and a vailability of clients. So, but we are 
quite bullish on that part as well.  
Participant: Thank you. 
Rohan Shah: Thank you. 
Moderator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Nishi, an individual investor.  Please go 
ahead. 
Nishi Bobe: Hello, sir. My question was regarding acquisition of TrustEdge Capital Limited. So, what are 
the plans for TrustEdge Capital for next 2 years? And how does this acquisition align with 
your company, Deep Industries? 
Rohan Shah: No, we are not acquiring TrustEdge Capital. 
Nishi Bobe: No? 
Rohan Shah: I think you misunderstood. 
Nishi Bobe: No problem, sir. Thank you. 
Moderator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Srikar Sai, an individual investor. Please 
go ahead. 
Srikar Sai: Thank you for the opportunit y and congratulations on a great set of numbers, sir. So, it is 
regarding our offshore vessel acquisition . So, in this last 2 to 3 months, we have this Chinese 
ICBC, I mean, the Commercial Bank, which was auctioning Bourbon class of vessels. So, 17 
have been auctioned, and most of them were laid up. So, they were tending to bring them back 
onto service, once these buyers buy them, they are going to bring them back into service. So, 
did this put any downward pressure on  the anchor handling tugs or platform supply vessels, 
sir? Because there were 17 which were auctioned off, and there are another 8 or 9 which are in 
 Deep Industries Limited 
November 10, 2025 
 
 Page 12 of 18 
service, which are about to come to auction again.  So, did it put any pressure on the offshore 
vessels, so that we can actually buy them at a cheaper rate, the ones which we have shortlisted? 
Rohan Shah: No. So, see, in offshore, the entire globe is the market and largely our assets are deployed 
overseas only. So, that market is quite a huge, and I don't think by coming these assets into the 
market will be creating any pressure.  Secondly, our contracts are long-term, and so we believe 
we would not have any point for taking this as a pressure. 
Srikar Sai: No. I meant like the pressure and the selling rate. If the  selling rate comes down, we can 
actually buy the vessels at a cheaper price  because we have not bought them, we are about to 
buy them. So, this auction, this entire saga, which will actually put that  hangover effect and 
then push the prices downward, because there are another 7 or 8 in -class anchor handling tugs, 
which are about to come into the auction. 
Rohan Shah: Yes, we have kept all options open. And since we would be applying a strategy of buying old 
assets only and getting them ready, so we would de finitely look for similar kind of 
opportunities as well. 
Srikar Sai: And some one clarification regarding production enhancement contract, th e 35 crores, is it the 
quarterly run rate or is it the half-yearly run rate, which we were expecting? 
Rohan Shah: No, in second half, we are expecting, in fact, more than 35 crores. So, ideally, it should be 
more than 40-45 crores in H2 on half -year business I am seeing. So, in this financial year 
FY26, we are expecting total revenue of around 60 crores from this produ ction enhancement 
contract. And from next year onwards, it should be more than 140 crores on full-year business. 
Srikar Sai: Great. And one small clarification, it's regarding ONGC Sick Well program. It looks a little bit 
like the production enhancement contract. So, is it a production enhancement contract, a little 
bit similar? ONGC Sick Well revival program, which is about to end in December.  
Rohan Shah: So, yes, ONGC Sick Well program is a little different than production enhancement.  
Paras Savla: So, sick well  is basically that they are not producing anything out of it. So, the challenges 
within sick well are different to the ones of the enhancement. So, there are few tenders that for 
sick well , they have already been published.  We are evaluating tha t probabilities , and how  
potential are those. So, I think it will take some amount of time to evaluate and then perhaps 
we will take some decision on that. 
Srikar Sai: Great sir. That's it from me. Thank you. 
Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Vinay from IGE India. Please go ahead. 
Vinay: Your revenues from 200 crores from last quarter to this quarter has been increased to 220 
crores. Can you elaborate on that increase?

Rohan Shah: So that increase is primarily because of addition of new assets into operation. And this year we 
are adding so many assets into our fleet with running contract and so as and when these assets 
will be added into the operation, it will give you an incremental revenue. 
Vinay: So, this will be sustainable next quarter with the current level of CAPEX [inaudible-00:38:18]- 
Rohan Shah: But yes, the momentum of growth would continue. 
Vinay: Thank you. 
Moderator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Rakesh  Kumar, an individual investor. 
Please go ahead. 
Rakesh Kumar: First of all, congratulations on a great set of numbers. I have only one question.  So, I was 
thinking about what kind of risks you see in the business, which could potentially hamper the 
growth going forward. We have been running on a great trajectory of late. But do you foresee 
more competition potentially coming in the area or something happens from like government 
direction perspective that could potentially hamper?  So, what are one or two ri sks that's top of 
your mind, which can potentially hamper the growth? 
Paras Savla: So, as the sector definitely gets more and more of business, potential business competition 
definitely is bound to come. So, that fact cannot be ignored. But having said that, we have been 
into this industry for more than three decades.  And I believe that the edge that we have over 
the technical things and providing solutions to the client is something that matters the most. 
So, even after having a competition, I think we hav e already sustained for last three decades 
with a decent amount of growth. And I'm very sure that as we go forward, we'll continue with 
that trajectory. 
Rakesh Kumar: That sounds great. And if I may add, it sounds like there is a large dependency on ONGC, 
from gearing business. So, what  is the current breakdown looks like in terms of revenue 
coming from ONGC versus other players? 
Rohan Shah: Yes, ONGC is always been our largest client. And since you are into oil and gas support 
services, I believe ONGC has to be your largest client. And in terms of percentage 
dependency, yes, they are almost 60% kind of contributor to our revenue. 
Rakesh Kumar: Got it, sir. Is there a push from your end as to diversify maybe or like bring in more private 
players or other players, so that the risk kind of subsides a little bit? 
Rohan Shah: Yes, we have over a period of time diversified with all other companies as well. So, in earlier 
years, ONGC used to be contributing more than 75%-80%. So, which we eventually by adding 
a few more private clients and started focusing on overseas, this dependence is reduced a bit.  
But having said so, when you are operating in India, and that too in oil and gas, ONGC would 
definitely be there.

Rakesh Kumar: Got it. Thank you, sir. That's all from my end. 
Rohan Shah: Thank You. 
Moderator: Thank you. The next question  comes on the line of Rahil from Sapphire Capital.  Please go 
ahead. 
Rahil: Thank you for the opportunity again. Sir, you quickly you mentioned something about the 
fundraiser. I am just not aware about the nature of this. If you can just add a few more lines 
and what is the root of this fundraiser? 
Rohan Shah: Yes, so we are working towards raising funds through QIP. And that exercise we have started 
on. So, we are expecting to raise around (+300) crores by the way of QIP. 
Rahil: But and this is to be used for just like expansion? 
Rohan Shah: Yes, for expansion and for acquisition of new assets, as well as for CAPEX in production 
enhancement contract. 
Rahil: And you gave a breakdown of the order book . (+ 1,300) crores is PEC and the rest is other 
projects. So, in the rest part of 1 ,700 crores or so, can you tell me how much proportion is like 
high margin projects? 
Rohan Shah: More or less margins are of similar nature for us. Of course, gas business is having little higher 
margin than our other business verticals. But they are more or less in similar kind of proportion 
in the order book. 
Rahil: So, you mean the gas business , in terms of value is same as the other projec ts in part of that 
1,700 crores or so? 
Rohan Shah: Yes, more or less in same line. Correct. 
Rahil: So, can we expect in the coming two quarters the margins to inch up? 
Rohan Shah: Yes, we are expecting margins to improve further. 
Rahil: Any sort of bracket you can give what we can expect to end the year with? 
Rohan Shah: That is little difficult to quantify in terms of number. But , yes continuously it is improving and 
we believe it should improve further as well. 
Rahil: And these margins you are guiding, in  the beginning of the call, you said 45 % to 46%  to 
maintain. This is with other income you are guiding?

Rohan Shah: So, in that, we are adding other income. Yes. 
Rahil: All right, sir. Thank you and all the best. 
Rohan Shah: Thank you. 
Moderator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Pankaj Motwani from Equirus Capital. 
Please go ahead. 
Pankaj Motwani: Thank you for the opportunity. Congratulations on your total number. So, my only question is 
on the part of margins.  So, if I see there are the  standalone margins, excluding other income, 
that has been modulated to around 37% over the last three quarters versus the earlier guidance 
of around 40%. So, do we expect the margins to reach going ahead or should we assume this to 
be a normalized margin for the future? 
Rohan Shah: On standalone basis, it should improve to 40% without considering other income. So, in 
coming quarters, we are expecting to improve from current level. 
Pankaj Motwani: So, is there any reason behind the margin fall from 40% to 37% in the last three quarters? 
Rohan Shah: So, with an addition of production enhancement, the volume in overall revenue, once it will 
start increasing from that particular project, overall margin will improve to that extent. 
Pankaj Motwani: Got it. And ju st want an update on the anchor tugs. We have taken 37% stake for the anchor 
tugs in one of the companies. So, the revenue from that anchor tugs has started contributing for 
this quarter? 
Rohan Shah: So, since it is a less than 50% share, it would not be consolidated by line to line. So, that would 
be contributing in bottom line. 
Pankaj Motwani: But I am not able to see the share of JV line item in the P&L portion. If we have a JV, so, there 
should be some share of JV line item. 
Rohan Shah: So, that would be coming up in coming quarters because the share would be distributed on 
yearly basis. 
Pankaj Motwani: Got it. That's all my questions. All the best. 
Rohan Shah: Thank you. 
Moderator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Sau mil Shah from Pa ras Investments.

Saumil Shah: Hi, management. Good morning and congrats on a very good set of number. So, I joined a bit 
late. So, I am sorry if this question was answered before.  So, wanted to know more on Dolphin 
Offshore. So, what kind of revenues are we targeting in next one or two years? How can we 
see this business in next couple of years? So, just wanted your thoughts. 
Rohan Shah: This year, we are expecting to close Dolphin Offshore at around 100 crores of top line in 
FY26. And from next year onwards, we are expecting good amount of growth with addition of 
few more assets into the fleet. 
Saumil Shah: So, have we already added those assets or we are… 
Rohan Shah: No, we have shortlisted them. We have not yet added. But we are on advance stage of  
negotiations. 
Saumil Shah: And so, what kind of growth can we expect in next 1 or 2 years because 100 crores seem too 
less. So, next couple of years can be quantify? 
Rohan Shah: So, the growth we are expecting in Dolphin would be more tha n 40% year-on-year. And since 
it is a high margin business.  So, currently, we are operating on EBITDA of as high as (+80%) 
kind. And I think with that high margin, this kind of growth would be exceptional. 
Saumil Shah: Correct. My final question for the fi rst half of this year for deep industries.  So, we have, we 
can see about 65% YOY growth if we compare first half to this first half. So, can we expect 
similar growth in the remaining half of this year? 
Rohan Shah: Yes. So, growth would continue definitely , on percentage I cannot give the exact guidance on 
65% kind. But H2 would definitely be higher than H1. So, growth would definitely be there. 
Saumil Shah: And have you guided in terms of revenue for Deep Industries for this year? 
Rohan Shah: This year we are expecting to close with growth of more than 35% YOY. And I think we are 
right there on that trajectory. So, even if we are not factoring growth in H2, it would be more 
than 38 %-39% kind of growth over previous years.  So, I think we are right there on t hose 
trajectory. 
Saumil Shah: That's it from me, sir. Thank you and all the best.  
Rohan Shah: Thank you. 
Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Yash Bishri ya from Mavira AMC. Please go 
ahead. 
Yash Bishriya: Congratulations on a strong  set of numbers.  Sir, my question is more on the macros. So, you 
said that India has always been a net importer and now we are moving on the part of energy

self-reliance, correct? So, any government push or any major policy changes that we see in the 
coming times since you are working closely with the PSUs and the government agencies?  So, 
any commentary on those lines? 
Paras Savla: So, energy push is quite visible for the fact the kind of tenders, the kind of generation of 
enquiries are happening and the ki nd of orders that we are receiving. So, the kind of demand 
that has been generated clearly demonstrates the push that government has. And if you even 
see to the production enhancement contracts or Sick Wells or something. So, this is also 
something a push that government is trying to make these fields more effective whereby they 
can get more and more production of oil and gas. So, I think this is a big  time signal from the 
government that their push has been more largely to get more oil and gas production. 
Yash Bishriya: Understood, sir. Thank you so much. 
Moderator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line Arun, an individual investor. Please go 
ahead. 
Arun: Good morning, sir. Thank you for the opportunity. A couple of bookkeeping questions. First is 
regarding the Kandla Energy. I understand the receivable. We believe we are not writing off as 
we believe we will be able to collect something. But are we taking any provision on that? 
Rohan Shah: So, we have not taken any provision on that as of now because we are in an evaluation stage of 
those receivables. So, as of now, we are not taking any provision. 
Arun: So, other questions. I am seeing your cash flow statement. We have given a loan at this time, to 
which company you have given a loan  given to? We have given 23.58 crores. You have given 
a loan. I am seeing the cash flow consolidated. It is given to which company? 
Rohan Shah: 23 crores. I will need to check. 
Arun: Actually, my question was that I think we have around 100 crores of loans now as of no w 
given. And we are raising QIP of 300 crores. Maybe some rationale for that.  We are already 
giving loans and then we are raising equity. So, just maybe some rationale is there which I am 
missing to understand. 
Rohan Shah: So, largely the loans given to subsidiaries like Dolphin and other companies who are at the end 
of day getting... 
Arun: Sir, not subsidiary. I am talking about consolidated. Consolidated loan will not come of 
subsidiaries. 
Rohan Shah: On consolidated you are saying. Correct.  So, there one loan is given to company called Prabha 
Energy and it is a 12% interest bearing loan. And that particular loan was originally given 
before de-merger. So, I think that is still continue there.

Arun: Perfect. Thank you, sir.  
Rohan Shah: Thank you. 
Moderator: The next question. The last question for today's conference call is from the line of A aryan 
Doshi from Divitiae Investments. Please go ahead. 
Aaryan Doshi: I was just asking that given the company is already generating strong cash flows and has a very 
low debt level, what is the rationale behind raising 300 crores through a QIP? Is it primarily to 
accelerate the 400 crores CAPEX or to strengthen the balance sheet for future opportunities? 
Rohan Shah: So, I would say both because we believe that our balance sheet should have the lowest possible 
leverage. As in our industry, we have always seen that people have gone wrong because of 
high leverage. And so, we believe that we should have leverage which should be very much in 
control. And of course, th e momentum and the growth we are foreseeing in coming years, it 
would definitely help us capturing that growth with such strong balance. 
Paras Savla: Also, there are some possibilities we are looking around for acquisitions. So, when the 
acquisitions have to happen, we should be ready with our resources. So, there are multiple 
things related to the growth and acquisitions put together  and therefore, we are trying to raise 
this fund. 
Aaryan Doshi: I was just asking that out of that 400 crores CAPEX, how much has been done and how much 
has been in the future more? Like out of that 400 crores CAPEX, how much more would be 
put to the board? 
Rohan Shah: So, total CAPEX we are expecting is of 600 crores of which 100 crores has already been done. 
And balance would be going further, including the CAPEX for production and contract. 
Aaryan Doshi: Thank you so much, sir.  
Rohan Shah: Thank you. 
Moderator: Thank you, participants. This was the last question for today's conference call. I now hand the 
conference over to Mr. Rohan Shah for closing comments. Over to you, sir.

any further queries, you can definitely approach us directly or through Adfactors PR. We 
would be happy to answer all your queries. Thank you.
