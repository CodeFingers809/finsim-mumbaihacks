Limited Review Report on Quarterly and six months ended Unaudited Financial 
Results of Reliance Chemotex Industries Limited pursuant to the Regulation 33 of 
the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 
To 
Board of Director of 
Reliance Chemotex Industries Limited 
We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results (‘the Statement’) 
of Reliance Chemotex Industries Limited (“the Company”) for the quarter and six months 
ended 30 September 2025, attached herewith, being submitted by the Company pursuant to the 
requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, as amended including relevant circular issued by the SEBI from time to time. 
This Statement, which is the responsibility of the company’s management and approved by the Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement 
principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” (“Ind AS 34”), prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. Our 
responsibility is to express a conclusion on the statement based on our review. 
We conducted our review in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagement (SRE) 2410, 
“ Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditors of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This Standard requires that 
we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the financial 
statement is free of material misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of 
Company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus provides less 
assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do not express an 
audit opinion. 
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with applicable accounting 
standards and other recognized accounting practices and policies has not disclosed the 
information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations 
including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material 
misstatement.
