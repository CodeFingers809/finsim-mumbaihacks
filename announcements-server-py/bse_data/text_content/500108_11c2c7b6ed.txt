S.L. Chhajed & Co. LLP Chartered Accountants 
We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited standalone financial results of Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited ("the Company / MTNL") for the quarter and period ended September 30th, 2025 ("the Statement"), being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 and 52 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended. 
D1, B-38 D, Janakpuri, West Delhi New Delhi -110058 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and approved by its Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordarnce with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" (Ind AS 34) prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, as amended, read with relevant rules issued there under and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
4. Adverse Conclusion 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity", issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that wve plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the Statement is free from material misstatement. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of Company's personnel responsible for financial and accounting matters and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013 and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
CGLA 
Based on our review conducted as above, we, considering the matters described in "Basis for Adverse Conclusion" (para 5) hereunder, give an adverse concBusion on accompanying statement of unaudited financial results for the quarter with respect to applicable Indian Accounting Standards, other recognized accounting practices, compliance of certain accounting principles and material misstatement in the accompanying results. However, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results and policies has failed to

(8 
disclose the infomation required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 and 52 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 including the manner in which it is to be disclosed. 5. Basis for Adverse Conclusion Based on the review performed by us and the information provided by the Management of Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited, the basis for our adverse conclusion is as follows: i) The Net Worth of the Company has been fully eroded; the Company has incurred net cash loss during the quarter and period ended September 30, 2025 as well as in the previous year and the current liabilities exceeded the current assets substantially. Further, during the quarter under review the Company has also defaulted in repayment of certain installments of term loan amounting to Rs. 2,045 Crores and interest on term loan amounting to Rs.1,012 Crores. Furthermore, Department of Public Enterprises vide its Office Memorandum No. DPE/5(1)/2014-Fin. (Part-IX-A) has classified the status of the Company as "Incipient Sick CPSE". Department of Telecommunication (DOT) has also confirmed the status vide its issue no. I/3000697/ 2017 through file no. 19-17/2017-SU-II. Pursuant to the Service Level Agreement (SLA) dated 22 November 2024 between MTNL and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited ("BSNL"), certain revenue of the company has been transferred to BSNL, the amount of which not quantifiable. As a result of this transfer, MTNL has ceased to conduct direct billing and customer account management for its core telecom operations in these circles. Although the Service Level Agreement (SLA) entrusts BSNL with operational responsibilities for MTNL's telecom services, it does not contain an explicit provision for transferring the revenue to BSNL. Further, in accordance with the Service Level Agreement (SLA), while revenue from these operations is now being recognized by BSNL, the associated operational expenditure-including network maintenance, infrastructure upkeep, and employee costs-continues to be incurred by MTNL. This is against the matching principle of accounting, which requires that revenues and the coresponding expenses be recognized within the same reporting entity and period. During the current quarter, as informed by the management that the customer base relating to Fibre to-the-Home (FTTH) services has been migrated to BSNL through a structured customer surrender process. Furthermore, in respect of Landline (LL) and Broadband (BB) services, it has been observed that MTNL has started issuing invoices in the name of BSNL, thereby effectively transferring the related revenue to BSNL. Customers have migrated from MTNL to BSNL, however the security deposit liability against these customers are still lying in the books of MTNL. Additionally, the Company has availed credit facilities from banks secured against its current assets, including receivables from customers. However, the aforementioned transfer of billing and revenue recognition to BSNL adversely impacts the rights of lenders over future receivables, as these will no longer be recognized in MTNL's books. This shift dininishes the security available to lenders. However, the standalone financial results of the Company have been prepared on a going concern basis keeping in view the majority stake of the Government of India. Further, Union Cabinet has also approved the "Revival plan of BSNL and MTNL" by reducing employee costs, administrative allotment of spectrum for 4G services, debt restructuring by raising of sovereign guarantee bonds, monetization of assets and in principle approval for merger of BSNL and MTNL. Further, the Company implemented the Voluntary Retirement Scheme in FY 2019-20 resulted

into reduction in Employees Cost and also raised funds by issuing Bonds for Rs. 6,500 Crore in FY 2020-21 in line with cabinet note. As per F.NO.20-28/2022-PR dated August 2nd, 2022, the Union Cabinet in its meeting held on July 27h, 2022 had approved tlhe raising of Sovereign Guarantee bonds for MTNL with a tenure of 10 years or more for an amount of Rs. 17,571 Crores with waiver of guarantee fee to repay its high-cost debt and restructure it witlh new sustainable loan. Further, in view of unsustainable debts of MTNL, a Committee of Secretaries (COS) was constituted by Government of India to examine matters such as asset monetization, AGR dues, debt restructuring etc. for further course of action for merger of MTNL and BSNL. However, COS is reviewing various options submitted to them for solution of various issues related to MTNL which is under process. Due to/from Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL): The Company has certain balances receivable from and payables to Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL). The net amount recoverable of Rs. 3,961.74 Crores are subject to reconciliation and confirmation. The said amount includes Service Tax recoverable amounting to Rs. 129.13 Crores which has been clubbed under BSNL receivable. In view of non-reconciliation and non-confirmation and in view of various pending disputes regarding claims and counter claims we are not in a position to ascertain and comment on the recoverability and the correctness of the outstanding balances and resultant impact of the same on the standalone financial result for the quarter and period ended September 30, 2025 of the Company. The Company has certain balances receivable from and payable to the Department of Telecommunication (DOT). The net amount payable of Rs. 51.62 Crores subject to reconciliation and confirmation. In view of non-reconciliation and non-confirmation, we are not in a position to ascertain and comment on the recoverability and correctness of the outstanding balances and resultant impact of the same on the standalone financial results for the quarter and period ended September 30th, 2025 of the Company. The organization has recognized accrued rental income pertaining to F.Y. 2021 to 2024 of Rs. 89.80 Crores for which billing could not be processed due to a lack of confirmation from the parties or because the agreements with them have expired. However, GST liability on the same amounting to Rs. 16.16 Crores has not been discharged. Due to the downtime of the company's billing server since January 2024, accrued income on account of IUC charges from other operators amounting to 5.45 Crores were booked on which GST liability has not been discharged, amounting to Rs 0.98 Crores. v) Up to the financial year 2011-12, License Fee payable to the DOT on IUC charges to BSNL was worked out on an accrual basis as against the terms of License agreements requiring deduction for expenditure from the gross revenue to be allowed on actual payment basis. From the financial year 2012-13 onwards, the license fee payable to the DOT has been worked out strictly in terms of the license agreements. vi) Apart from impairment losses previously recognized for CDMA assets, no further impairment has been accounted for under Ind AS 36 during the quarter and period ended September 30th 2025. Due to uncertainties in achieving the Company's future projections, we are unable to determine the adequacy of impairment provisions and theis impact on the current quarter"'s loss. vi) The Company has developed a a system of obtaining confirmations and performing reconciliation of balances in respect of amount receivables from trade receivables, deposits with Government Departments and others, claim recoverable from operators and other parties and amount payable to

trade payables, claim payable to operators and amount payable to other parties, however complete balance confirmations and reconciliations are not yet obtained. Accordingly, certain amounts receivable from and payable to the various parties are still subject to confimation and reconciliation. Pending such confirmation and reconciliation, the impact thereof on the standalone financial results for the quarter and period ended September 30h, 2025, are not ascertainable and quantifiable. vii) The company does not follow a system of reconciliation of the difference between TDS balance as per applicable. Pending such reconciliation, the impact thereof if any on the standalone IND AS financial statement is not ascertainable and quantifiable. book and as per TDS certificate and form 26AS under Income-tax Act 
iN) Unlinked credit of Rs. 35.61 Crores on account of receipts from subscribers against billing by the Company which could not be matched with corresponding receivables is appearing as liabilities in the balance sheet. To that extent trade receivables and current liabilities are overstated. Pending reconciliations, the impact thereof on the standalone fnancial results for the quarter and period cnded September 30h, 2025 are not ascertainable and quantifiable. x) Property, Plant and Equipment are generally capitalized on the basis of completion certificates issued by the engineering department or bills received by the finance department in respect of bought out capital items or inventory issued from the Stores. Due to delay in issuance of the completion certificates/ receipt of the bills/ receipt of inventory issue slips, there are cases where capitalization of the Property, Plant and Equipment gets deferred to next year. We are unable to comment whether the Capital Work-in-progress (CWIP) shown in books in the current quarter are actually part of CWIP or have already been commissioned. The resultant impact of the same on the standalone financial results for the quarter and period ended 30h September, 2025 by way of depreciation cannot be ascertained and quantified. xi) Department of Telecommunication (DOT) had raised a demand of Rs. 3,313.15 Crores in 2012-13 on account of one-time charges for 2G spectrum held by the Company for GSM and CDMA for the period of license already elapsed and also for the remaining valid period of license including spectrum given on trial basis. Also, as explained, pending finality of the issue by the Company regarding surrender of a part of the spectrum, crystallization of issue by the D0T in view of the claim being contested by private operators and because of the matter being sub-judice in the Court on account of dispute by other private operators on the similar demands, the amount payable if any, is indeterminate. Accordingly, no liability has been created for the demand made by DOT on this account and Rs. 3,205.71 Crores has been disclosed as contingent liability till FY 2018-19 although no further demand is there from DOT till date. However as explained further, the TDSAT while setting aside the levy of OTC on spectrum allotted beyond 6.2 MHz directed Govt. to review the demand for spectrum allotted after July t, 2008 and that too w.e.f, January 1, 2013 in case the spectrum beyond 6.2 MHz was allotted before January 1 2013. As explained as per the TDSAT orders also, no further demand has been raised till now and as per management based on TDSAT direction, the demand, if any, cannot be more than Rs. 455.15 Crores. The same is considered as contingent liability. In view of the above we are not in a position to comment on the correctness of the stand taken by the Company and the ultimate implications of the sanme on the standalone financial results tor the quarter and period ended September 30, 2025 of the Company.

Xi) The Company has recovered Electricity Charges from the tenants on which liability for Goods and Services Tax (GST) has not bcen paid. The actual impact of the same on the standalone financial results for the quarter and period ended September 30, 2025 has not been ascertained and quantified. xiii) The TDS on provision for expenses (Accrued Liability) have not been deducted under chapter XVI[ B of Income-tax Act, 1961. The actual impact of the same on the standalone financial results for the quarter and period ended September 30th, 2025, have not been ascertained and quantified. 
(i) 
xiv) Till 30.06.2025, the Company followed the practice of recognizing Expected Credit Loss (ECL) only on Trade Receivalbles and not on other financial assets, specifically claim recoverable. This accounting treatment was not in compliance with Ind AS 109-Financial Instruments, which mandates that ECL should be recognized on all financial assets measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, including claim recoverable. 
In the absence of information, the effect of which can't be quantified, we are unable to comment on the possible impact of the items stated in the point nos. (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (viiü), (ix), (x), (xi), (xi), (xiii), and (xiv), on the standalone financial result of the Company for the quarter and period ended September 30th, 2025. 
During the quarter, the company has recognized a provision of Rs. 72.97 Crores, on amount recoverable for more than three years; out of the total recoverable from IUC Operators and Others of Rs. 771.19 Crores. The ECL model adopted by the Company requires a comprehensive review to ensure full compliance with Ind AS 109. 
6. Emphasis of Matter We draw your attention to the following notes to the unaudited standalone financial results: 
(v) 
Note No.6 Loan given by Government of India amounting to Rs.2,060.67 Crores for payment of Interest on Sovereign bonds does not stipulate terms regarding interest thereon. Therefore, the company has not provided any interest as aforesaid. (ii) Notes No.7 regarding pending dispute with the Income Tax Department before the Hon'ble Courts regarding deduction claimed by the Company u/s 80IA of the Income Tax Act, 1961, The company has created the Contingency reserve of Rs.243.22 Crores in this regard.

BSNL shall also take care of CAPEX and OPEX for smooth running of operations and ensure EBITDA neutral operations of the Company. (iv) Note No.10 Amount receivable from BSNL & Other Operators have been reflected as other financial assets instead of bifurcating the same into trade receivables and other financial assets. Note No.1 1 regarding the amount recoverable from Department of Telecommunications ("DOT") in respect of settlement of General Provident Fund (GPF) amounting to Rs.6.52 Crores of Combined Service Optees absorbed employees in MTNL and the matter is stili under review with DOT and the full amount of GPF including interest thereon, is continued to be shown as recoverable from DOT and payable to GPF. (vi) Note No.13 stating that the payables towards license fees and spectrum usage charges have been adjusted with excess pension payouts to Combined Pensioners Optees recoverable from DOT in respect of which matter is under consideration and correspondence is going on between the Company and DOT.

(vn) Note No.14 stating that the License agreement between Company and DOoT does not have any guidance on change in method of calculation of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) due to migration to Ind-AS from i-GAAP. Provisioning and payment of liability in respect of license fees and spectrum charges payable to DOT have been done on the basis of Ind-AS based financial statements. The amount of difference in computation of Adjusted Gross Revenue is under consideration of DOT. (vii) Notes No.15 regarding dues from the Operators being on account of revenue sharing agreements are not treated as debtors. Considering the prolonged outstanding balances, delays in payments, reconciliation and setlement, the company has reassessed the probability of recovery of such receivables and proposed for provisioning the same. Accordingly, the company has recognized a provision for Expected Credit Loss on such balances, amounting to Rs. 72.09 Crores which are outstanding for a period of more than 3 years. (ix) Note No.16 Certain immovable properties transferred from Department of Telecommunications (DOT) to MTNL in earlier years, which were taken on lease by DOT prior to incorporation of MTNL. On March 30, 1987, both DOT and MTNL entered into a sale deed for transfer of the several movable and immovable assets from DOT to MTNL. The said transfer includes the leasehold land and building which are now in possession of MTNL since the execution of the sale deed. These leasehold immovable properties have not been mutated or renewed in the name of MTNL till date. However, considering MTNL is a Public Sector Undertaking (PSU), the sale deed not registered at that time and executed by DOT is deemed to have been registered for the purpose of transfer of all such assets in terms of section 90 of the Indian Registration Act, 1908 as considered by the MTNL and stamp duty payable, if any, will be borne and paid by Government as and when any such occasion arises as per sale deed. Accordingly, the leasehold immovable properties have been classified as management under the heading Right of Use Assets'. (x) Note No.17 Regarding amount payable to GPF trust is currently in the process of reconciling its liabilities to determine the provident fund payables to employees. The adjustment if any resulting from this re-computation/ reconciliation will be recognized once the reconciliation process is completed.

Certain immovable properties (includes the leasehold lands and buildings) transferred from Department of Telecommunications ('DoT) to MTNL in earlier years through a sale deed. These ieasehold immovable properties have not been mutated or renewed in the name of MTNL till date. However, considering MTNL is a Public Sector Undertaking ('PSU'), the sale deed not registered at that time and executed by DOT is deemed to have been registered for the purpose of transfer of all such assets in terms of section 90 of the Indian registration act, 1908 as considered by the MTNL and stamp duty payable, if any, will be borne and paid by Government as and when any such occasion arises as per sale deed. Accordingly, these leasehold immovable properties have been classified by the management under the heading 'Right of Use assets'.

conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of consolidated unaudited financial results of Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited ("the Holding Company /MTNL") and its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as "the Group"), and its share of the net loss after tax and total comprehensive income of its joint venture for the quarter and period ended September 30, 2025 ("the Statement"), being submitted by the Holding Company pursuant to the requirement of Regulations 33 and 52 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended. 2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Holding Company's Management and approved by the Holding Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" ("Ind AS 34"), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted India.

3. We conducted our revievw of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity", issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the Statement is free from material misstatement. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primariBy of Company's personnel responsible for financial and accounting matters and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013 and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not expres an audit opinion. We also performed procedures in accordance with the Circular No. CIR/CFD/CMD/44/ 2019 dated March 29th, 2019 issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India under Regulation 33(8) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as anmended, to the extent applicable.

Adverse Conclusion Based on our review conducted as above, we, considering the matters described in "Basis for Adverse Conclusion" (para 5) hereunder, give an adverse conclusion on accompanying statement of unaudited financial results for the quarter with respect to applicable Indian Accounting Standards, other recognized accounting practices, certain accounting principles and material misstatement in the accompanying results. However, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results and policies has failed to disclose the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 and 52 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 including the manner in which it is to be disclosed. 6. Basis for Adverse Conclusion 
Wholly Owned Indian Subsidiary Wholly Owned Overseas Subsidiary Joint Venture 
Based on the review performed by us and the information provided by the Management of Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited, the basis for our adverse conclusion is as follows: (i) The Net Worth of the Company has been fully eroded; the Company has incurred net cash loss during the quarter and period ended September 30h, 2025 as well as in the previous year and the current liabilities exceeded the current assets substantially. Further, during the quarter under review the Company has also defaulted in repayment of certain installments of term loan amounting Rs. 2,045 Crores and interest on term loan amounting to Rs.1,012 Crores. Furthermore, Department of Public Enterprises vide its Office Memorandum No. DPE/5(1)/2014-Fin. (Part-IX-A) has classified the status of the Company as "Incipient Sick CPSE". Department of Telecommunication (DOT) has also confirmed the status vide its issue no. I/3000697/ 2017 through file no. 19-17/2017-SU-II. Pursuant to the Service Level Agreement (SLA) dated 22 November 2024 between MTNL and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), certain revenue of the company has been transferred to BSNL, the amount of which is not quantifiable. As a result of this transfer, MTNL has ceased to conduct direct billing and customer account management for its core teleconm operations in these circles. Although the Service Level Agreement (SLA) entrusts BSNL with operational responsibilities for MTNL's telecom services, it does not contain an explicit provision for transferring the revenue to BSNL. Further, in accordance with the Service Level Agreement (SLA), while revenue from these operations is now being recognized by BSNL, the associated operational expenditure-including network maintenance, infrastructure upkeep, and employee costs-continues to be incurred by MTNL. This is against the matching principle of accounting, which requires that revenues and the corresponding expenses be recognized within the same reporting entity and period. During the current quarter, as informed by the management that the customer base relating to Fibre-to the-Home (FTTH) services has been migrated to BSNL through a structured customer surrender process.

Furthermore, in respect of Landline (LL) and Broadband (BB) services, it has been observed that MTNL has started issuing invoices in the name of BSNL, thereby effectively transferring the related revenue to BSNL. Customers have migrated from MTNL to BSNL, however the security deposit liability against these customers are still lying in the books of MTNL. Additionally, the Company has availed credit facilities from banks secured against its current assets, including receivables from customers. However, the aforementioned transfer of billing and revenue recognition to BSNL adversely impacts the rights of lenders over future receivables, as these will no longer be recognized in MTNL's books. This shift diminishes the security available to lenders. However, the standalone financial results of the Company have been prepared on a going concern basis keeping in view the majority stake of the Government of India. Further, Union Cabinet has also approved the "Revival plan of BSNL and MTNL" by reducing employee costs, administrative allotment of spectrum for 4G services, debt restructuring by raising of sovereign guarantee bonds, monetization of assets and in principle approval for merger of BSNL and MTNL. Further, the Company implemented the Voluntary Retirement Scheme in FY 2019-20 resulted into reduction in Employees Cost and also raised funds by issuing Bonds for Rs. 6,500 Crore in FY 2020-21 in line with cabinet note. As per F.NO.20-28/2022-PR dated August 2nd 2022, the Union Cabinet in its meeting held on July 27t, 2022 had approved the raising of Sovereign Guarantee bonds for MTNL with a tenure of 10 years or more for an amount of Rs. 17,571 Crores with waiver of guarantee fee to repay its high-cost debt and restructure it with new sustainable loan. Further, in view of unsustainable debts of MTNL, a Committee of Secretaries (COS) was constituted by Government of India to examine matters such as asset monetization, AGR dues, debt restructuring etc. for further course of action for merger of MTNL and BSNL. However, COS is revievwing various options submitted to them for solution of various issues related to MTNL which is under process. 
(ii) Due to/from Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL): The Holding Company has certain balances receivable from and payables to Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL). The amount recoverable of Rs.3,961.74 Crores is subject to reconciliation and confirmation. The said amount includes Service Tax recoverable amounting to Rs. 129.13 Crores which has been clubbed under BSNL receivable. In view of non-reconciliation and non-confirmation and in view of various pending disputes regarding claims and counter claims, we are not in a position to ascertain and comment on the recoverability and correctness of the outstanding balances and resultant impact of the same on the consolidated financial results for the quarter and period ended September 30th, 2025, of the Group including its joint venture. (iii) The Holding Company has certain balances receivable from and payable to the Department of Telecommunication (DOT). The net amount payable of Rs.51.62 Crores subject to reconciliation and confirmation. In view of non-reconciliation and non-confirmation, we are not in a position to ascertain and comment on the recoverability and correctness of the outstanding balances and resultant impact of the same on the standalone financial results for the quarter and period ended September 30h, 2025 of the Company.

(iv) The Holding Company has recognized accrued rental income pertaining to E.Y. 2021 to 2024 of Rs. 89.80 Crores for which billing could not be processed due to a lack of confirmation from the parties or because the agreements with them have expired. However, GST liability on the same amounting to Rs. 16.16 Crores has not been discharged. Due to the downtime of the company's billing server since January 2024, accrued income on account of IUC charges from other operators amounting to Rs. 5.45 Crores were booked on which GST liability has not been discharged, amounting to Rs 0.98 Crores. (v) Up to the financial year 2011-12, License Fee payable to the D0T on IUC charges to BSNL was worked out on accrual basis as against the terms of License agreements requiring deduction for expenditure from the grosS revenue to be allowed on actual payment basis. From financial year 2012-13 onwards the license fee payable to the DOT has been worked out strictly in terms of the license agreements. (vi) Apart from impairment losses previously recognized for CDMA assets, no further impaisment has been accounted for under Ind AS 36 during the quarter and period ended September 30th 2025. Due to uncertainties in achieving the Company's future projections, we are unable to determine the adequacy of impairment provisions and their impact on the current quarter's loss. (vii) The Holding Company has developed a a system of obtaining confirmations and performing reconciliation of balances in respect of amount receivables from trade receivables, deposits with Government Departments and others, claim recoverable from operators and other parties and amount payable to trade payables, claim payable to operators and amount payable to other parties, however complete balance confirmations and reconciliations are not yet obtained. Accordingly, certain amounts receivable from and payable to. the various parties are still subject to confirmation and reconciliation. Pending such confirmation and reconciliation, the impact thereof on the standalone financial results for the quarter and period ended September 30, 2025, are not ascertainable and quantifiable. (viii) The Holding Company does not follow a system of reconciliation of difference between TDS balance as per book and as per TDS certificate and formn 26AS under Income-tax Act as applicable. Pending such reconciliation the impact thereof if any on the Consolidated Ind-AS financial statement for the quarter and period ended September 30, 2025 is not ascertainable and quantifiable. (ix) Unlinked credit of Rs. 35.61 Crores on account of receipts from subscribers against billing by the Holding Company which could not be matched with corresponding receivables is appearing as liabilities in the balance sheet. To that extent, trade receivables and current liabilities are overstated. Pending reconciliations, the impact thereof on the Consolidated financial results are not ascertainable and quantifiable. (x) Property, Plant and Equipment are generally capitalized on the basis of completion certificates issued by the engineering department or bills received by finance department in respect of bought out capital items or inventory issued from the Stores. Due to delays in issuance of the completion certificates or receipt of the bills or receipt of inventory issue slips, there are cases where capitalization of the Property, Plant and Equipment gets deferred to next year. We are unable to comment whether the Capital Work-in-progress (CWIP) shown in books in the current year are actually part of CWIP or have already been commissioned. The resultant impact of the same on the Consolidated financial results for the quarter and period ended 30th September, 2025 by way of depreciation cannot be ascertained and quantified. JED

(xi) Department of Telecommunication (DOT) had raiscd a demand of Rs. 3,3 13.15 Crores in 2012-13 on account of one-time charges for 2G spectrum held by the Company for GSM and CDMA for the period of license already clapsed and also for the remaining valid period of license including spectrum given on trial basis. Also as explained, pending finality of the issue by the Holding Company regarding surrender of a part of the spectrum, crystallization of issue by the DOT in view of the claim being contested by private operators and because of the matter being sub-judice in the Court on account of dispute by other private operators on the similar demands the amount payable if any, is indeterminate. Accordingly, no liability has been created for the demand made by DOT on this account and Rs. 3,205.71 Crores has been disclosed as contingent liability till FY 2018-19 although no further demand is there from DOT till date. However as explained further, the TDSAT while setting aside the levy of OTC on spectrum allotted beyond 6.2 MHz directed Govt. to review the demand for spectrun allotted after July 1, 2008 and that too w.e.f, January 1, 2013 in case the spectrum beyond 6.2 MHz was allotted before January 1%, 2013. As explained as per the TDSAT orders also no further demand has been raised till now and as per management based on TDSAT direction the demand, if any cannot be more than Rs. 455.15 Crores the same is considered as contingent liability. In view of the above we are not in a position to comment on the correctness of the stand taken by the Holding Company and the ultimate implications of the same on the consolidated financial results for the quarter and period ended September 30", 2025 of the Holding Company including its joint venture. (xii) The Holding Company has recovered Electricity Charges from the tenants on which liability for Goods and Services Tax (GST) has not been paid. The actual impact of the same on the consolidated financial results for the quarter and period ended September 30, 2025 has not been ascertained and quantified. (xii) The TDS on provision for expenses (Accrued Liability) have not been deducted under chapter XVII-B of Income Tax Act, 1961. The actual impact of the same on the consolidated financial results for the quarter and period ended September 30, 2025, have not been ascertained and quantified. (xiv) Till 30.06.2025, the Company followed the practice of recognizing Expected Credit Loss (ECL) only on Trade Receivables and not on other financial assets, specifically claim recoverable. This accounting treatment was not in compliance with Ind AS 109 -Financial Instruments, which mandates that ECL should be recognized on all financial assets measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, including claim recoverable. During the quarter the company has recognized a provision of Rs. 72.97 Crores, on amount recoverable for more than three years; out of the total recoverable from IUC Operators and Others of Rs. 771.19 Crores. The ECL model adopted by the Company requires a comprehensive review to ensure full compliance with Ind AS 109. In the absence of information, the effect of which can't be quantified, we are unable to comment on the possible impact of the items stated in the point nos. (i), (i), (ii), (iv), (V), (vi), (vii), (vii), (ix), (x), (xi), (xii), (xiii), and (xiv), on the consolidated financial result of the Company for the quarter and period ended September 30, 2025.

The said transfer includes the leasehold land and building which are now in pOSsession of MTNL since the execution of the sale deed. These leasehold immovatble properties have not been mutated or renewed the name of MTNL till date. However, considering MTNL 0s a Public Sector Undertaking (PSU), the sale deed not registered at that time and executed by DOT is deemed to have been registered for the purpose of transfer of all such assets in terms of section 90 of the Indian Registration
