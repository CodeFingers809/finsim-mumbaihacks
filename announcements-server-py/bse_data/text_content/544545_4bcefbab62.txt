India’s largest ethanol producer TruAlt Bioenergy signs MOU to set up one of the 
World’s Largest Sustainable Aviation Fuel manufacturing facilities in Andhra Pradesh 
with ₹2,250 crore investment
Bengaluru, November 15, 2025: TruAlt Bioenergy Limited (TruAlt), one of India’s largest and fastest-growing 
biofuels producers, today announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Andhra 
Pradesh Economic Development Board (APEDB) to develop one of the world’s largest Sustainable Aviation 
Fuel (SAF) production facilities in the State of Andhra Pradesh. The proposed 80,000 TPA facility will be 
located around the Srikakulam–Vizianagaram region of Andhra Pradesh.
Under the MoU, TruAlt Bioenergy will invest approximately ₹2,250 crore to establish an integrated ethanol-to-SAF 
manufacturing facility. The proposed plant is expected to create over 500 direct jobs and nearly 2,000 indirect jobs, 
catalysing substantial economic growth across allied sectors and contributing to the region’s industrial expansion 
and employment generation.
TruAlt will also leverage its position as India’s largest ethanol producer to secure reliable, high-quality feedstock 
and drive efficient, large-scale SAF production through the Alcohol-to-Jet Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene 
(ATJ-SPK) pathway, one of the certified and approved routes under the International Civil Aviation Organization 
(ICAO) framework. In this pathway, any sugar-based feedstock is converted into ethanol, which is then upgraded 
into aviation-grade jet fuel. By adopting this technology, TruAlt will produce low-emission, internationally 
certified SAF and enable a scalable, dependable and globally competitive supply chain built on India’s 
abundant agricultural and bio-based resources.
Speaking on this milestone, Vijay Nirani - Managing Director, TruAlt Bioenergy, said:
“This MoU marks a defining moment in India’s clean-energy transition and in TruAlt Bioenergy’s journey of 
innovation and impact. Sustainable Aviation Fuel is no longer a future possibility, it is an urgent global necessity. 
By establishing one of the world’s largest ethanol-to-SAF facilities in Andhra Pradesh, we are taking a 
decisive step toward enabling low-carbon aviation at scale in one of the world’s most hard-to-abate 
sectors.

fuels, support the nation’s net-zero ambitions and contribute to a cleaner, more resilient future for the 
aviation industry and the world
