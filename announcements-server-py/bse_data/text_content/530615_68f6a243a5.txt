discipline. Our shift toward value-added steel has strengthened our margins, while our upcoming alloy steel expansion 
through Vaneera will position us among the most competitive mid-sized steel players in North India. FY 2024-25 was a 
foundation-building year : FY 2025-26 will be the year of accelerated scale.”
