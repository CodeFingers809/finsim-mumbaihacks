Mumbai, India, Nov 14, 2025 : Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Lt d. (Glenmark), a research-led, global 
pharmaceutical company, today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended 
September 30, 2025. 
 
For the second quarter of FY 202 6, Glenmark’s consolidated revenue was at Rs. 60,469 Mn as against Rs. 
34,338 Mn in the corresponding quarter last year, recording an increase of 76.1% YoY. 
 
EBITDA was Rs. 23,596 Mn in  the quarter ended September 30, 2025, as compared to Rs. 6,019 Mn in the 
corresponding quarter of the previous year, registering growth of 292% and an EBITDA margin of 39%. 
 
Profit After Tax (PAT) for the quarter was Rs. 6,104 Mn, up 72.2% YoY, with a PAT margin of 10.1%. 
 
Commenting on the results, Glenn Saldanha, Chairman & Managing Director, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd. 
said, “Q2FY26 reflects the steady progress we are making in strengthening Glenmark’s scientific and strategic 
foundation. The AbbVie partnership for ISB 2001 , along with the income recognised this quarter,  is a significant 
validation of our scientific strength and enables us to advance the pipeline in a financially self-sustaining way. 
Across key markets, our performance remained resilient. North America delivered a continued uptick in 
performance, supported by the expansion of our injectable portfolio  and steady execution across institutional 
channels. Europe returned to its growth trajectory, backed by recent product launches. In India, GST-related 
adjustments, given our unique three-tiered distribution model, had a one-time impact on primary sales; however 
secondary sales continue to outperform IPM, and we expect reported growth to normalize from Q3 onwards.” 
“Our specialty and innovation  businesses progressed several important milestones this quarter including the 
global expansion of RYALTRIS®, the UK launch of WINLEVI®, the regulatory and clinical milestones achieved for 
QiNHAYOTM, and our IGI oncology assets. We remain committed to disciplined execution, advancing meaningful 
science, and delivering sustained value for our patients, partners, and all stakeholders.”

ISB 2301: IMMUNITE™ Platform 
• ISB 2301 is a first-in-class multispecific NK cell-engager developed for solid tumors and the first 
program from IGI’s IMMUNITE™ platform 
• A Clinical Candidate was selected in October 2025, and the program has entered the IND -
enabling stage 
 
IMMUNOLOGY – PARTNERED PROGRAMS  
IGI has two monoclonal antibody drug product candidates addressing autoimmune diseases in the 
pipeline. To enhance the company’s focus on oncology, future development of both assets is 
overseen by out-licensing partners. 
 
ISB 880/LAD191 (anti-IL-1RAP antagonist) 
• ISB 880 was licensed to Almirall, S.A. in December 2021.  
• The initiation of dosing in a Phase 1 study of ISB 880/ALM27134/LAD191 was announced by 
Almirall in September 2022. Almirall completed Phase I single and multiple ascending doses in 
healthy volunteers, presenting the results at the recent European Academy of Dermatology 
and Venereology (EADV) 2025 congress as a late-breaking oral presentation: 
o Phase I data on LAD191  in patients affected by Hidradenitis Suppurativa suggests a 
favorable safety and tolerability profile, along with early signs of clinical improvement 
supporting the continued development of this asset. 
• Almirall recently announced that ISB 880/LAD191 had moved into Phase 2 in Hidradenitis 
Suppurativa 
 
ISB 830 (telazorlimab), ISB 830-X8/STAR-0310 (OX40 antagonist)  
• ISB 830 and the OX40 antagonist platform were licensed to Astria Therapeutics in October 
2023. Telazorlimab is an OX40 antagonist that successfully completed a Phase 2b study in 
moderate to severe Atopic Dermatitis (AD) in 2021.  
• ISB 830-X8/STAR-0310 is in development for the treatment of Atopic Dermatitis and potentially 
other indications. STAR -0310 is a potential best -in-class, T -cell sparing, immunomodulating 
OX40 antagonist designed to have a long half-life.  
• Phase 1 trial was initiated in the first quarter of 2025.  Astria presented initial data from the 
Phase 1a trial of STAR -0310 at the European Academy of Dermatology & Venereology (EADV) 
Congress 2025 in a late-breaking oral presentation: 
o Based on the initial results from this trial, STAR -0310 was well -tolerated, with no 
10 Management Discussion & Analysis: Q2 FY 2025-26 
 
 
Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity-related treatment-emergent adverse events. 
Preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile exhibited sustained target 
therapeutic effect for at least 3 months following a single  dose, demonstrating early 
proof of concept for a long-acting differentiated OX40 receptor antagonist.  
o These findings support the potential for infrequent maintenance dosing, including the 
possibility of dosing intervals for as long as every 6 months, which may enhance 
adherence and reduce the treatment burden for patients with chronic  inflammatory 
diseases, including Atopic Dermatitis and other immune-mediated diseases.

Overview of Immunology Candidates in Development 
• IGI has two monoclonal antibody drug product candidates addressing autoimmune diseases in 
the pipeline. To enhance the company’s focus on oncology, future development of both assets 
is overseen by out-licensing partners. 
• The first asset, ISB 880, an anti-IL-1RAP antagonist, was licensed to Almirall, S.A. in December 
2021. The initiation of dosing in a Phase 1 study of ISB 880/LAD191 was announced by Almirall in 
September 2022. Almirall completed Phase I single and multiple ascending doses in healthy 
volunteers, presenting the results at the recent European Academy of Dermatology and 
Venereology (EADV) congress:

successfully completed a Phase 2b study in moderate to severe Atopic Dermatitis (AD) in 2021. 
STAR-0310 is in development for the treatment of AD and potentially other indications.  Phase 1 
trial was initiated in the first quarter of 2025 and Astria announced positive initial results from the 
phase 1a healthy subject trial of STAR-0310 at the recent European Academy of Dermatology 
and Venereology (EADV) congress: 
o Results support potential for STAR-0310 to be Best-in-Class OX40 Antagonist. 
o STAR-0310 exhibits longest-in-class half-life of 68 days and cytokine suppression lasting 
at least 20 weeks after a single 300 mg SC injection, supporting potential every-six-
month administration.
