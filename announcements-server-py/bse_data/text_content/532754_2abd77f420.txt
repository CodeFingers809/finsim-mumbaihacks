GMR Airports – Key Updates
▪ DEL Traffic Insight: 
▪ ^ Note: Muted growth in traffic (specifically domestic traffic) in Q2FY26 & YTD FY26 attributable to temporary 
disruptions in flight operations caused by changed airspace conditions amid series of geopolitical events and 
Runway 10/28 upgradation at Delhi Airport (Enhanced Runway has re-opened on 16 Sep’25 & upgraded Terminal 
2 became operational on 26 Oct’25 – An upward trend is clearly evident in the October '25 traffic)                                             
• * Resumption of Traffic Growth: In Oct’25, Pax traffic increased by 11.7% MoM (compared with Sep’25) with 
Domestic Pax growth of 12.6% & International Pax growth of 9.3%
• On 26 Oct’25, reported Highest Single day Pax traffic of ~2.5 lakh & Highest Single day ATM of 1370 in YTD FY26
• Resilient Traffic at DEL: To be noted in context that YTD FY26 Total Pax decline is equivalent to ~1 week Pax handled 
at Delhi Airport – Traffic trajectory is expected to further strengthen & transcend going ahead due to greater airport 
efficiency resulting from enhanced & optimized runway operations as well as other strategic initiatives
