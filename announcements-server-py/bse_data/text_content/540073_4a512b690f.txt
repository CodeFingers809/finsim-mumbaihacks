I would like to hand over the call to Mr. Shikhar Aggarwal for his opening remarks, post
which Mr. Amit Sudhakar will discuss the financial performance of the company, and we will
then open the floor for a Q&A session. Over to you, Shikhar.
Shikhar Aggarwal: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for the BLS Q2 & H1 FY'26 Earnings
Call. We trust that you have had an opportunity to review the results, press release, and
investor presentation, which have been uploaded to the stock exchanges and our website.
We are pleased to share that the company has delivered a strong performance during the
quarter, reflecting robust operational momentum across our key business verticals. On a
consolidated basis, revenue for the second quarter increased 49% year-on-year, while
EBITDA grew by 30%.
On a sequential basis, we have maintained our EBITDA margins at around 29% in the second
quarter, and we feel the margins have now stabilized at these levels. Profit after tax for the
quarter rose by 27%. The results provided a solid platform for the sustained growth in the
Page 3 of 15
BLS International Services Limited
November 12, 2025
remainder of the fiscal year.
Our visa and consular service business continued to strengthen its global footprint and
reinforce our leadership in the outsourced visa processing industry. During the quarter, we
secured a 3-year mandate from the MEA, Government of India to operate India Visa
application centers across key cities in China, including Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.
With improving dynamic relationships between India and China, we anticipate a meaningful
increase in visa volumes going forward. In addition, we were awarded a contract by the
government of Cyprus to establish a visa application center in Kazakhstan, thereby further
enhancing our international presence.
Visa volumes increased by 12% during Q2 FY'26, rising to 11.3 lakh applications compared
to 10.1 lakh applications in Q2 FY'25. Net revenue per application improved by 12% from
INR2,883 in Q2 FY'25 to INR3,223 in Q2 FY'26, supported by enhanced service offering and
favorable business mix. Our subsidiary, iDATA, continued its strong growth momentum,
processing around 1.8 lakh applications during the quarter, demonstrating sustained demand
and operational efficiency.
The successful integration of iDATA and new contracts positions us well for the enhanced
expansion. In a major milestone, we also won a prestigious and large-scale contract valued at
around INR 2,000 crores from the Unique Identification Authority of India to establish
district-level Aadhaar Seva Kendra. The long-term agreement reinforces our proven capability
in executing large-scale e-governance and public service delivery projects, while
strengthening our role in India's digital ecosystem. This contract will be executed over a
period of 6 years.
Now moving on to the digital service business. Revenue from digital services increased
significantly from INR77 crores in Q2 FY'25 to INR278 crores in Q2 FY'26, registering a
remarkable growth of around 259% year-on-year. This is primarily due to the consolidation of
Aadifidelis Solutions, which was acquired in November 2024.
During the quarter, our digital service business continued to strengthen its partner ecosystem
through strategic collaborations aimed at expanding service offerings and enhancing customer
reach. We entered into key partnerships with Aditya Birla Capital and Piramal Finance in July
2025, followed by many other companies.
In the same month, we also partnered with Grameen Foundation for Social Impact. The
partnerships collectively reinforces our position as an integral and diversified digital service
platform. We continue to expand our digital service network, which now exceeds
approximately 147,000 touchpoints, underscoring our commitment to enabling financial
inclusion and enhancing digital services across India.
In our BC business, we processed around 3.5 crore transactions during the quarter, with gross
Page 4 of 15
BLS International Services Limited
November 12, 2025
transactional value crossing INR27,300 crores. We further strengthened our distribution
network by adding more than 15,000 channel service partners, taking the total to over 45,400
BCs as of September 30. Our partners generated loan leads of approximately INR8,600 crores
for financial institutions during the quarter, compared to INR1,400 crores in Q2 FY'25,
reflecting deeper market penetration and enhanced service delivery.
Now I'll turn over the call to Mr. Amit Sudhakar, our CFO, for further updates on our
financial performance. Thank you.
Amit Sudhakar: Thank you, Shikhar. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to share our consolidated
financial results for the second quarter and first half ended September 30, 2025. For Q2 FY'26,
our revenue reached INR737 crores, representing a strong 49% year-on-year growth from
INR495 crores in Q2 FY'25. This growth was driven by a steady increase in application
volumes and the consolidation of Citizenship Invest and Aadifidelis, which added further
momentum.
Our EBITDA for the quarter rose to INR213 crores compared to INR164 crores last year,
recording a growth of almost 30%. The EBITDA margin stood at 28.9%. Margins have now
largely stabilized at this level, as the key benefit from shifting to the self-operated center
model and integrating our acquisition businesses has been realized.
Profit before tax for the quarter stood at INR203 crores, up 24% from INR164 crores in the
same quarter last year. Profit after tax increased by 27% to INR186 crores compared to
INR146 crores a year ago. It's worth noting that this strong growth came despite lower other
income during Q2 FY'26. The earnings per share for the quarter were INR4.25 compared to
INR3.36 per share in Q2 FY'25.
Now looking at the half-year performance, the revenue for H1 FY'26 stood at INR1,447
crores versus INR988 crores last year, up by 46%. EBITDA rose to INR417 crores from
INR297 crores, a growth of 40% with the margin steady at 29%. Profit after tax for the half
year was INR367 crores compared to INR267 crores last year, showing a 38% increase.
Coming to segmental highlights. In Q2 FY'26, the Visa and Consular Services segment
recorded a revenue of INR 457 crores, a 10% growth over INR 418 crores last year. EBITDA
for the segment rose by 26% to INR192 crores with a margin of 42%, an improvement of 549
basis points from 36.4% margin last year. Visa application volumes also grew 12% from 10.1
lakh to 11.3 lakh applications. This improvement in profitability was driven by higher
volumes, cost optimization, and the strategic shift to a self-run model across key geographies.
In the first half, Visa & Consular services revenue grew by 11% to INR919 crores compared
to INR832 crores last year. EBITDA for the segment rose sharply by 38% to INR378 crores
with a margin improving to 41% from 33% last year, reflecting our focus on efficiency and
profitability.

In the Digital Business segment, revenue reached INR278 crores in Q2 FY'26, up from INR77
crores a year ago. EBITDA for the quarter was INR21 crores, a 72% rise with a margin of
7.4%. This growth was primarily driven by the consolidation of Aadifidelis.
For the first half, the Digital Business segment revenue reached INR528 crores compared to
INR156 crores in H1 FY'25. The EBITDA for H1 FY'26 was INR39 crores as compared to
INR24 crores in the corresponding period of the previous financial year. The company
continues to maintain a strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet with net cash of
INR1,306 crores as on September 30, 2025, compared to INR928 crores as on 31, March
2025.
With that, I will now hand over to the moderator to open the floor for questions. Thank you.
Moderator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes
from the line of Shrenik Mehta from Indo Alps Wealth.
Shrenik Mehta: I have two questions. One, on the digital service, we've seen a sharp decline in EBITDA.
What is the vision for the EBITDA over the next few quarters? How do you see that evolving?
Shikhar Aggarwal: No. See, if you look at the digital service business, our EBITDA margin has dropped
primarily because of the acquisition of new company, Aadifidelis, which we acquired in
November 2024. The margin is 3% on the revenue and the increased revenue. If you see on an
overall basis, our EBITDA has grown to INR20 crores from INR12 crores in the previous
year's last quarter.
Basically, definitely percentage has gone down, as we said, explained also at the time of
acquisition of Aadifidelis, since it's a high revenue, less EBITDA margin company. Our
immediate objective is to maintain the EBITDA margin, but overall, you can see that both our
revenue and profitability have increased.
Shrenik Mehta: You believe the margin would remain at 7% going forward as well?
Shikhar Aggarwal: No, I mean, in all of our business, our objective is to grow the margin, but right now, as the
base of the company has really increased, we aim to stabilize the margin. Going forward, as
we introduce more value-added services, there is definitely scope for improvement.
Shrenik Mehta: My second question was about the hotel acquisition. I really can't see how e-visa company or
a digital service company can say that this is strategic or this is something which is a part of
the diversification. What was the real trigger behind the acquisition? What do you see the
hospitality segment evolving as far as the BLS International is concerned?
Shikhar Aggarwal: See, our first of all, long-term objective is to be asset-light player. As you know, we want to
be brand name owner, as we are in the industry wherein we are in touch with a lot of travel
Page 6 of 15
BLS International Services Limited
November 12, 2025
agents across the world, where the people who are applying for tourist visa, etc., they continue
to demand for different kind of services, which is airline, hotels, etc., booking from us, so we
thought that this would -- we did a very small investment, if you see from our cash reserves
that we have, to understand this, which itself gives us a 10% to 12% return on our investment.
Our objective is that once we learn, our objective is not to invest, but to acquire the expertise
so we can run our own brand name. Our objective is to run an asset-light model as in the visa
business. That was the strategy because our customers are the same. We are globally in touch
with all the travel agent community, customers who are demanding different types of services.
That was the reasoning behind getting into that.
Shrenik Mehta: Tomorrow, if the customers are thinking about an airline, we could also do something in the
airline sector?
Shikhar Aggarwal: See, that obviously is a multibillion-dollar business, and we don't have the bandwidth to invest
in that. As I said, this was that one investment to understand how the businesses are. Then,
going forward, our objective is to be an asset-light business.
Moderator: The next question comes from the line of Krishnam Saraf from Samriddhi Finserve Family
Office.
Krishnam Saraf: I just have one question on the top line. This INR736 crores as of Q2, what would be that
number, if we exclude the acquisition, Citizenship and Aadifidelis?
Shikhar Aggarwal: Amit?
Amit Sudhakar: These two businesses had contributed around INR200 crores in the revenue, which is about on
the top line, around 20% - 25%.
Krishnam Saraf: Excluding that, it's around INR536 crores versus INR495 crores of Q2 of last year?
Amit Sudhakar: That's right. On the PBT, it is about 5%, 6% only because Aadifidelis, as Shikhar said, the
margins are about, 2.5%, 3% only.
Krishnam Saraf: The second question was on the MEA ban that was issued. I'm a bit confused around that. A
few days after the ban was issued, the company also made a filing on winning a new contract
from the MEA. If you could just give us some color on is the ban still effective? That is one.
Second is, what was the actual cause of the ban? If you can provide some color on that as well.
Shikhar Aggarwal: Yes. As we when we had released in the exchanges, we had already announced in the
interviews that we had received a notification from the MEA, saying that there were some
customer complaints because of that, they are temporarily putting a ban on applying for new
tenders. This tender we had already won. We are currently operating all government contracts
Page 7 of 15
BLS International Services Limited
November 12, 2025
for the Indian government as well as across the world, so there's no issue on that. As we said,
we are working to resolve soon, and we are hopeful of resolving the matter soon. There
should be no issue or any impact on our financials, etc.
Krishnam Saraf: The ban is still effective, if I understand correctly. Can you also elaborate on what the
customer complaints were? That would be helpful.
Shikhar Aggarwal: No, there were some SLA-driven complaints regarding waiting time, etc., that is normal when
you're processing millions of applications. We had already announced that. We are working
towards resolving the matter and are hopeful that it will be resolved soon. There is no impact
on our financials or revenue.
Moderator: The next question comes from the line of Vansh Solanki from RSPN Ventures.
Vansh Solanki: My question is about organic growth in the Visa segment. If I look at the Visa and Consular
segment, the revenue is approximately 10% only, while the management is always telling that
the industry is already growing at 14%, 15%. Our Y-o-Y growth is very slow down in the last
2 quarters. Last quarter was also around 11% and this quarter is also Y-o-Y around 10% only.
Even my number of applications are growing, net revenue is also growing, but why my
revenue is not suiting up?
Shikhar Aggarwal: Amit, if you can explain to him that our EBITDA has grown by 30%, and you can also
explain to him.
Amit Sudhakar: Yes. the growth depends on the volume of business. Over the last two quarters, the volumes
have increased by 10%, and our revenue has also matched that growth. Whereas, if you look
at the margins, they have improved over the last year; if you compare them now with last year,
the margins have increased by more than 500 basis points. Improvement has been done on
account of rationalization and the cost.
Vansh Solanki: I already understood about the EBITDA and all, but that is because of the partner acquisition,
which we have done; our EBITDA and gross margin also shot up very nicely. I'm just
concerned about the organic growth in the visa segment, why it is very stable even over the
last 3 quarters, I see. In March also, it's INR440 crores, June also, it's INR460 crores and in
September also it's INR460 crores only?
Amit Sudhakar: Yes. That depends on the volume, basically. See, the travel volume is growing at 10%; the
revenue will follow accordingly.
Vansh Solanki: Another question on the revenue, can you just give me the split of revenue of Citizenship
India, Aadifidelis, and iDATA for this quarter?
Amit Sudhakar: Yes. As I said, Citizenship Invest was about INR14.5 crores, iDATA was about INR71.5
Page 8 of 15
BLS International Services Limited
November 12, 2025
crores.
Vansh Solanki: The last question is on the guidance of a number of applications for the full-year '26?
Shikhar Aggarwal: See, we have done 11.3 lakh applications this quarter. The first quarter is a high season, and
our second quarter is also a high season. Our objective is to achieve more numbers than we
did last year. Right now, in terms of volume, we don't know how many volumes is expected in
third quarter and fourth quarter. We definitely wish to surpass whatever we have achieved in
the last few years.
Moderator: The next question comes from the line of Viren Sameer Deshpande from Alphapeak
Investments.
Viren Deshpande: It was nice to see the growth in all our businesses continue very well. We are growing this
digital services business in a big way. Now, we secured a contract from the government with
respect to this Aadhar Center establishment, etc., which is, I think, more than INR2,000 crores.
I think you had mentioned that this revenue will be received over a period of 6 years. Is it
correct?
Shikhar Aggarwal: Correct. That is correct. We have recently won this landmark project from central government,
wherein we will be establishing around 250 to 300 centers within India. It will start from
December. Gradually, we anticipate that the revenue will increase. This is the minimum level
that we aim to achieve, but if we can process more transactions, the revenue can be even
higher.
Viren Deshpande: To understand this, you mentioned that suppose this work starts from January onwards, so in a
quarter, suppose we establish about 10 centers, after establishment, per center, we are going to
get some revenue?
Shikhar Aggarwal: See, it is according to the volume that we generate. Once the project is started in full force, all
the centers are started, and all the volumes start coming in. It takes some months for the
volumes to go to the normal level, then we will get the full revenue. Definitely, it will take
some months to ramp up, but as I said, from next year, the revenue will start coming.
Viren Deshpande: Annually, we expect any ballpark figure, any idea of annual revenue?
Shikhar Aggarwal: You can divide by 6.
Viren Deshpande: About INR350-odd crores, if I divide.
Shikhar Aggarwal: Correct. When the project is fully ramped up, we expect that revenue to come in.
Viren Deshpande: Secondly, you clarified about this Ministry of External Affairs thing and the complaints and
all those things. That is good. We hope to get it resolved sooner, but after that only, we
Page 9 of 15
BLS International Services Limited
November 12, 2025
secured new business from Ministry of External Affairs?
Shikhar Aggarwal: I just explained this. I clarified in the previous question as well.
Viren Deshpande: Yes. For China, we got that, that was a good thing.
Shikhar Aggarwal: Correct.
Viren Deshpande: Regarding this hotel, as you mentioned, since our business is not to be investing in big, we
want to be asset-light, pursue this model because our margins, etc., will be significantly
dampened if we invest in these types of businesses. It will be good, we restrict our investment
in this line and keep on making good margins as we are making currently?
Shikhar Aggarwal: No. As we have explained, our objective is to be in the asset-light business. We want to offer
full topography of services. As we said, we were getting a lot of customer demand for
different kinds of services, hotels, etc., so we thought it was a good model that we could get
into the asset-light managed hotel business.
From that, we made one small investment. Learning from that, then we can replicate across
the world, so this was the objective of how we started the digital services in 2016. I think this
will really add to our revenue and profitability in the coming years as well.
Viren Deshpande: But we don't propose to buy any properties further?
Shikhar Aggarwal: No.
Viren Deshpande: Our margins are currently about 28%. Do we expect to hold on to about this 28%, 29% level?
Shikhar Aggarwal: Correct. These are the consolidated margins. As you know, more than 40% EBITDA margins
we are doing in the visa business, our immediate and long-term objective is to sustain the
margins that we have achieved.
Viren Deshpande: Yes, because Visa gives us a good business margin of 40%-odd. These digital services will
dilute it to some extent, but we will also be getting good revenues. Together, blended margins
should be in the range of 29-30%, which is our goal.
Shikhar Aggarwal: Correct.
Moderator: The next question comes from the line of Arpit Shah from Stallion Asset.
Arpit Shah: I just wanted to understand what kind of cash we are holding right now on the Indian books?
Amit Sudhakar: You're talking about the Indian books; it will be around INR350 crores.
Arpit Shah: About INR1,000-odd crores would be then on the international books, right?
Page 10 of 15
BLS International Services Limited
November 12, 2025
Amit Sudhakar: Yes. It will be all over the globe. Together, it will be around INR1,000 crores.
Arpit Shah: Any plans to get back the cash from overseas subsidiaries to India? Because what's typically
happening right now is that we have been seeing a phenomenal performance in terms of
revenues, EBITDA, visa applications, and everything, but all of that is not getting reflected in
our valuations today in terms of the market cap that we should be having.
We broadly have a 2-player market globally, we and VFS, and the kind of valuations markets
are giving us today is because of probably the cash that is staying outside of India. If we can
probably get that cash to India by paying all kinds of taxes, whichever are necessary, probably
that will push up the valuations for our company, which is doing phenomenally well in terms
of its execution, but given the cash is outside, the valuation stays has a cap to its number. How
are you thinking about it?
Amit Sudhakar: Last year, if you look at, we did about INR900 crores of investment in new acquisitions
outside India. It all happened from the cash there. In the current year, we are also looking at
more acquisitions. As and when they get crystallized, we will need cash outside India rather
than in India for those.
Secondly, please understand that about 70% of our cash gets generated outside India. As and
when required, in the form of dividend and other payments, we are getting the money from
there. Depending on where we investments are required, we accordingly move the money in
those respective regions.
Arpit Shah: Is it possible to actually formulate a policy for dividends because we are a very high cash-
generating company. I don't think we will require that kind of cash growth every year those
kinds of opportunities are not available in the market currently, given there are limited players
which are doing visa processing. We can actually formulate a formal dividend policy and start
giving out the cash to shareholders. I think that would be a great strategy to have.
Amit Sudhakar: You are right. We have a dividend policy. Earlier, it was 15% of our consolidated cash
generated amount. Now we have raised it to 30% of our surplus cash after taking into account
any funding requirements, the net cash. The Board have the flexibility of increasing the
dividend going forward.
Arpit Shah: Any plans to have a buyback given where the valuations are for the company and what kind of
numbers you are going to be producing at least for the next couple of years is probably very
much attractive valuations for the company that you are in and the kind of opportunities
which is out there. Do you think a buyback would be a great opportunity to go ahead with?
Amit Sudhakar: Personally, I don't see any major tax benefit for the investors, in the case of the buyback.
Again, it's a Board decision, both options are open for the Board to take a call.
Page 11 of 15
BLS International Services Limited
November 12, 2025
Arpit Shah: Because minority investors, what is happening is typically, the market cap creation, which
should happen with this kind of performance, is not happening. Probably, the cash is one of
the reasons that is staying outside India, and one of the reasons why investors are not getting
that kind of confidence to actually be part of this journey. That is my only feedback.
Amit Sudhakar: I understand, but as per the SEBI guidelines for a buyback, the company free reserves are
taken into account for deciding the quantum of buy back. In our case, the free reserve for
buyback, the amount is very small. Dividend becomes, I would say, a better option for
rewarding the shareholders. Yes, these can be discussed by the Board, and I will certainly put
those options forward.
Arpit Shah: I think you all should look at this very, very strongly in this kind of process because that will
really help everyone out.
Moderator: The next question comes from the line of Shreya from Moneyvesta Wealth Management.
Shreya: Congratulations on the results. I had a question about your key government contract. As I saw
the official MEA report, the Kuwait contract has already expired in September 2025, and the
Canada contract will also be due for renewal in December. Could you update us on whether
this has been renewed, or if there is an interim arrangement in place, or if there is any annual
discussion to begin?
Shikhar Aggarwal: No. All our contracts are ongoing, and we have extensions in all our contracts. We need to see
the exact pipeline that you are mentioning, so right now, all our contracts are intact.
Shreya: The next question I want to ask, regarding the MEA ban. As you mentioned, it's a temporary
ban, so are you focusing on going beyond the visa application? What's your broader strategic
priority for the next 2 years in terms of government partnerships and geographical
diversification?
Shikhar Aggarwal: No. As we said, when we started, we were working with only one government from 2007 to
'08 when we started. Now our revenue from the Indian government is only 12% of our
revenue. We have continued to grow and gotten many new government clients. Our strategy is
to get more government contracts that are coming up for renewal, and that is what we are
focused on.
Shreya: Like outside India, you're talking about, not only in the Indian government, you are focusing
more on the outside India, different governments for the contracts?
Shikhar Aggarwal: Correct. Globally. We are focusing on India as well as globally.
Moderator: The next question comes from the line of Divyanshu Mahawar from Invexa Capital.
Divyanshu Mahawar: Congrats on the good set of numbers. My first question is regarding the visa application
Page 12 of 15
BLS International Services Limited
November 12, 2025
globally. What is the total number of visa applications that have been handled? Out of which
is -- how much is in-house and how much is outsourced? What I actually wanted to
understand is that for the next 2 to 3 years, what could be the potential of that outsourcing of
the total visa applications that are being handled?
Shikhar Aggarwal: See, what we handled, we can tell you that we handled around 11.3 lakh applications this
quarter. What we feel is that we currently have 15% to 17% global market share, and 50% of
the market is outsourced. 50% is yet to be outsourced, which is what the numbers we had
showed; there's no proper study that is out there, but this is what our assumption is.
There is an opportunity for tenders that are coming in the outsourced market as well. As well
as the new government, which has never outsourced, and also, there's a prospective
opportunity to even get contracts on that.
Divyanshu Mahawar: Secondly, on the visa business, if you look at the EBITDA margin, I think it is an all-time
high EBITDA margin, roughly around 42% EBITDA margin. Just wanted to understand what
percentage of your whole visa business has been converted to a self-centered model, which we
used to manage by a partner model. It's a 100% self-owned model, or it's 10%, 5% is
remaining on the partnered model. Because if it's remaining, then I think margin expansion
could also be a big change in Visa's business. What are your thoughts on this?
Shikhar Aggarwal: No. Our objective is to increase the base just to maintain the margins. We are at a very
increased pace. We don't expect the margins to go up. Our objective is to stabilize the margins.
We are operating in multiple countries, still with partners for different reasons, and we need to
check the exact numbers to determine how many we operate. The majority are operated by us
independently. This is the objective right now.
Divyanshu Mahawar: Is there any chance that the remaining countries that we are operating in have a partnered
model? Going forward, can they move towards a self-centred model?
Shikhar Aggarwal: Yes, we have to see the feasibility. There is a possibility some countries could move, but I
don't expect any further change in margins, since we have really reached a very high level
already.
Moderator: The next question is from the line of Abhijeet from Pi Asset Managers.
Abhijeet: Just two questions. How do you see the revenue mix between the visa segment and digital
services 2 years down the line?
Shikhar Aggarwal: See, revenue mix has changed primarily because of the acquisition of Aadifidelis, which is at
a higher revenue and less EBITDA. Around INR200-odd crores of revenue has come from
Aadifidelis. That is why if you see the revenue mix has a little bit changed in the visa and
digital business. Going forward, we feel that revenue in the Visa business will also go up.

Revenue in the digital business will also go up.
There could be some small change wherein Visa business could contribute more, but the
digital services business is also going forward at the same rate. I don't expect any downward
change in the revenue mix from the Visa business, but it could change in the future as we win
new contracts, both in the Visa and digital business.
Abhijeet: You largely expect the mix to remain the same, right?
Shikhar Aggarwal: Amit, what do you think? It's very difficult to answer at this point. I feel this is the bare
minimum. It could only be better.
Amit Sudhakar: I think it should get to that 70-30 range somewhere over the period. Again, it is subject to how
the new business comes in, as well as the acquisition.
Shikhar Aggarwal: Correct.
Abhijeet: The other question was regarding the ban from MEA. What steps are you taking towards not
getting a ban from other governments because...
Shikhar Aggarwal: We work with governments every day. Every day, we are in talks with the governments. We
are monitoring their SLA, etc., so our steps are always to fulfill all the contractual obligations.
So that is what we are focused on.
Moderator: The next question is from the line of Shikha Mehta from Time and Tide Advisors.
Shikha Mehta: I just have a few questions. I'm sorry if they're repetitive in nature. One, I wanted to
understand what our acquisition pipeline is going forward. If we have anything currently in
the pipeline or we have any targets of acquisitions for the next, say, 12 to 18 months?
Amit Sudhakar: Shikha, we have a couple of targets we are working on, and we hope to increase our pipeline
of target companies, which we can review and take them forward. We are quiet, I would say,
aggressively looking at decent acquisitions over the next couple of years.
Shikha Mehta: Sir, do we have a certain valuation target that we look at like a range, say, 2x sales or a certain
kind of EBITDA that we look to acquire?
Amit Sudhakar: Yes. our main focus is on those companies whose valuations are based on EBITDA multiple.
We never look at revenue multiple, and the whole objective is to look at the ROI point of
view, of returns, and then what synergies we can have.
Shikha Mehta: When we say ROI, do we mean ROI for us as in an acquiring company, what kind of ROI is
generated for us, or as an entity as a whole?

Amit Sudhakar: Yes, from our point of view. What return on our investment will we generate? We look at lot
of other parameters also. This will take a couple of hours to discuss, but more or less, the
bottom line is that we are serious about the acquisition and expanding our existing businesses
as well.
Shikha Mehta: Sir, secondly, can you tell me what percentage our stand-alone business has grown, that is,
without any of the new acquisitions?
Amit Sudhakar: In this quarter, because of the Aadifidelis, our acquired businesses have given us about 20% -
25% of the revenue, and about 6%, 7% in the PBT.
Shikha Mehta: How much has our visa business grown without counting any of the other assets?
Amit Sudhakar: This quarter is practically all organic growth, which has come in Q2.
Shikha Mehta: Broadly, organic growth only. 27% year-on-year, broadly, or 25% if you remove a bit of the
acquisition. Say, 25% is something you can consider year-on-year organic growth?
Amit Sudhakar: The organic growth, if you see the Visa business, we have done about 10% this quarter. That
is all in the Visa business and another 15% or so we have done in the Digital business.
Moderator: The next question comes from the line of Athar Syed from Smart Sync Services.
Athar Syed: Sir, I have one question: What is your vision for the next 3 to 5 years? Where are you seeing
your visa business and digital business? Currently, our visa business is around 75% and our
digital business is around 25%, so what should we assume in the future?
Amit Sudhakar: 70-30 is what we are looking for. Again, this all will depend on how the new contract comes
in and how the acquisition happens over the period of time.
Athar Syed: What kind of companies are we looking for in acquisitions? Last time we did hotels and etc.,
so any...
Amit Sudhakar: See, we are looking at businesses that have some synergy with our existing business, or we
can grow those businesses because of our reach and our clients, so that we can somehow
expand those businesses in the future.
Moderator: In the interest of time, this was the last question for today's conference call. I now hand the
