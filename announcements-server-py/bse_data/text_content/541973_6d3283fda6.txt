LIMITED REVIEW REPORT 
To, 
Board of Directors of Mac Hotels Limited 
We have reviewed the accompanying statement of Unaudited Financial Results (“the statement”) of M/s. MAC 
HOTELS LIMITED (the Company) for the half year ended 30th September, 2025 being submitted by the Company 
pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligation and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulation 2015 (“Listing Regulations”). 
This statement is the responsibility of the Company's management and approved by the Board of Directors, has 
been prepared in accordance with the Accounting Standard prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 
2013, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the 
SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (‘Listing Regulations'). Our responsibility 
is to issue a report on the Statement based on our review. 
We conducted our review in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagement (SRE) 2410, Engagements to 
Review Financial Statements issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that 
we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures 
applied to financial data and thus provides less assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 
accompanying statement of unaudited financial results prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind As’) specified under Section 
133 of the Companies Act, 2013 as amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of the 
Listing Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material 
misstatement.
