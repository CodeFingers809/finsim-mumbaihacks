3:00 PM and concluded on 05:00 P.M, at the registered office of the Company. After considering the financial 
statements and the revised inputs/clarifications provided by the Statutory Auditors, the Board approved the

the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of company personnel and an analytical procedure

believe that the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results prepared in accordance with the
