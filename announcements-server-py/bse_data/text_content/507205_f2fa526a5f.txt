Tilaknagar Industries Makes a Big Entry into Premium Whisky, Debuting a New 
Style with Seven Islands Pure Malt Whisky 
The launch marks a decisive entry into whisky for India’s largest brandy producer, following the Imperial 
Blue acquisition announcement 
 
Seven Islands is an Indo-Scottish 100% Pure Malt Whisky, made with four distinct single malts originating 
from India and Scotland 
 
Mumbai, November 20, 2025 - Tilaknagar Industries Ltd. (TI), India’s leading brandy producer and one of 
the country’s fastest growing spirits companies, has marked its entry into the premium whisky category 
with the launch of Seven Islands Pure Malt Whisky. Crafted from select Indian and Scottish malts, it is a 
distinct 100% pure malt expression.  
 
The launch marks a significant strategic expansion for TI, best known for building India’s brandy market 
with icons like Mansion House and more recently, Monarch Legacy Edition, and comes on the heels of its 
announcement of the acquisition of Imperial Blue, the world’s third largest-selling whisky brand. With this, 
the 90-year-old company establishes whisky as its second major growth pillar alongside its long-standing 
leadership in brandy. 
 
 
 
The Whisky Opportunity in India 
Whisky remains India’s most loved and aspirational spirits category, accounting for about 66% of total 
consumption in 2024 according to IWSR. By volume, Indian whisky grew 7% year-on-year in H1 2025, 
crossing 130 million cases and showing continued premiumisation. Exports are expanding as well, 

 
 
 
  
 
signaling rising global interest in Indian-made whiskies and premium expressions. For TI, a company that 
has built scale and expertise through long-standing leadership in brandy, the opportunity in whisky 
presents a clear and timely growth avenue. 
“India’s whisky story is evolving faster than ever, with growing consumer demand for premium and luxury 
expressions. Seven Islands marks TI’s entry into this dynamic category, bringing together Indian 
craftsmanship and global expertise to create a whisky that is both distinctly Indian and globally 
competitive. With whisky commanding over 60% of India’s spirits market, expanding into this category 
was the next natural step for us.” said Amit Dahanukar, Chairman and Managing Director, Tilaknagar 
Industries Ltd. 
A New Style of Whisky 
Seven Islands introduces a style that moves beyond the single-malt focus that has shaped recent 
conversations around Indian whisky. As a pure malt, it blends four single malts - two from India and two 
from Scotland, allowing it to draw unique characteristics from multiple distilleries, regions and maturation 
styles. 
The Indian malts are sourced from the Himalayan foothills and the Vindhyan ranges, bringing the 
influence of high-altitude and tropical ageing. These are paired with malts from Speyside and the 
Lowlands, two of Scotland’s most recognised whisky regions. This Indo-Scottish duality creates a profile 
not possible through a single-region malt. With single malts driving recent premium growth, Seven Islands 
offers a new direction: a pure malt style shaped by two climates, two traditions, and a more complex 
blending philosophy. 
A Tribute to Mumbai’s Seven Islands 
Seven Islands takes its name from the archipelago of seven islands that once formed the city of Mumbai 
— the long-time home of Tilaknagar Industries and the backdrop to much of its growth. This connection 
is built into the bottle design. Two converging lines create the V-cut neck, hinting at the Indian and Scottish 
malts coming together, while fine cartographic lines reference the contours of the original islands. At the 
centre sits an anchor motif, a nod to Mumbai’s maritime heritage. The palette of sage, cream and gold 
keeps the design crisp, contemporary and quietly premium. 
“Seven Islands reflects our vision for House of TI, our new vertical which includes our premium portfolio 
and investments arm. House of TI was created to shape our premium and craft-led portfolio, beginning 
with Monarch Legacy Edition. With Seven Islands, we wanted to bring a new perspective and style to Indian 
whisky. It felt like the right way to introduce something distinctive, and a meaningful step forward for us 
as we expand into the whisky category.” said Sanaya Dahanukar, Marketing Manager, Tilaknagar 
Industries Ltd.
