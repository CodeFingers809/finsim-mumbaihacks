Subject: Intimation of Credit Rating 
 
Dear Sir/Ma’am, 
 
Pursuant to Regulation 30 and other applicable provisions of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015, we hereby inform you that India Ratings and Research has assigned the 
credit rating of the Company as under: 
 
Sl noInstrument Type Amount (in million) Rating Assigned Outlook 
1 Bank loan facilities INR3,200 IND BBB/Positive/IND A2 Positive 
 
Rating Rationale: 
 
The ratings reflect the strong order book ensuring healthy revenue visibility, sticky customer 
relationships in the defence sector, and healthy operating performance at the consolidated level over FY24-
1HFY26. The ratings also factor in RTL’s ongoing efforts to diversify its revenue profile by adding new 
customers and expanding into other industries. The ratings, however, are constrained by the 
consolidated stretched credit metrics, largely due to an elongated working capital cycle, resulting from 
significant raw material inventory holdings. The Positive Outlook reflects Ind-Ra’s expectation of an 
improvement in RTL’s working capital cycle in the medium term, largely driven by a reduction 
in the inventory holding period, thereby resulting in an improvement in the credit metrics and liquidity. 
 
This is for your information and records. 
Thank you, 
 
For Rossell Techsys Limited
