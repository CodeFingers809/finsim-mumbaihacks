30th September, 2025 (the "Statement") attached herewith, being submitted by the 
Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, read with SEBI Circular No. 
CIR/CFD/CMDI/80/2019 dated 19th July, 2019. 
This statement is the responsibility of the Company's management and has been 
approved by the Board of Directors. My responsibility is to issue a report on these financial 
statements based on my review. 
| conducted my review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagement (SRE) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information performed by the 
independent auditor of the Entity" issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
This standard requires that | plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as

1. During the time of our audit, we have not been provided with satisfactory 
supporting documents for completeness of transactions pertaining to sales, 
purchase, valuation of inventory, third party balance confirmation of trade 
receivables and payable along with related tax compliances thereof 
outstanding as on 30th September, 2025 in the financial results. Therefore, we 
could not generate and obtain appropriate audit evidences for the aforesaid 
observations. 
2. During the time of audit, we have not been provided with fixed assets register. 
Due to lack of documents and supporting documents, we could not ascertain 
the genuineness of depreciation and deferred tax liabilities/assets. 
3. The company has unsecured loans for which management has not charged 
interest, and relevant loan agreements are not available. While a portion of 
these balances has been verified through cross-ledger verification, 
confirmations for the remaining balances have not been obtained. In the 
absence of valid agreements and necessary confirmations, the accuracy of the 
balances and their interest-free status could not be fully verified, which may 
impact the fair presentation of liabilities and interest expenses. 
4. The Company has significant trade payables; however, the bifurcation between 
Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) creditors has not been provided. 
Non-disclosure of the MSME classification is not in compliance with the 
provisions of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) 
Act, 2006, thereby affecting both regulatory compliance and financial 
transparency. Further, advances paid to suppliers remain unconfirmed. In the 
absence of confirmations from these parties raises concerns regarding the 
reliability and completeness of liabilities reported in the financial statements. 
5. Trade receivables outstanding as at the reporting date have not been 
confirmed by the respective debtors. In the absence of direct external 
confirmations or sufficient alternative audit procedures, we are unable to verify 
the accuracy, completeness, or recoverability of these balances. 
Based on my review conducted as above, apart from the aforesaid observations, nothing 
has come to my attention, apart from the matters reported under Basis for Disclaimer of 
opinion that causes me to believe that the accompanying statement of unaudited financial 
results prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and other recognized 
accounting practices and policies has not disclosed the information required to be 
disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 & 52 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
contains any material misstatement. FRN : 154463w
