So without any further ado, we shall commence this call. Over to you, Mukund sir. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
Thank you, Ron ak. Good evening, everyone. I really appreciate you all for taking out your valuable time, and I extend a heartiest 
welcome to everyone joining us today on the conference call for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025. I am happy to 
announce that we have reported good numbers for the Q2 fiscal 26, continuing the growth trajectory. We have witnessed growth across 
all business segments of our presence. 
 
Our top line for the quarter stood at INR 1,845 million, reflecting a 26% YoY growth and marginally decreased by 1% compared to 
the previous quarter. EBITDA came in at INR  601 million, which is a 42% increase YoY and 6% higher QoQ. Our EBITDA margin 
for the quarter stood at 33%. Moving to profitability, our profit after tax reached INR 447 million, registering a 34% growth YoY and 
11% increase QoQ. The PAT margins stood at 24% for the quarter. 
 
Now, I will take you through our segment -wise revenue performance for the second quarter of FY26 and compare it both YoY and 
sequentially with Q2 FY25 and Q1 FY26. Let's begin with Human Healthcare. Our largest segment, revenues for Q2 FY26 stood at 
INR 1,212 million, making a 22% YoY growth and a marginal decline of 1% QoQ. This growth was driven  by higher sales in the 
Pharma/API and Nutritional business across both domestic and international markets. Human Healthcare remains the vital of our port-
folio, contributing 66% of our total revenues. 
Page 3 of 22 
 
 
Next, we have Animal Healthcare, revenues rose to INR 193 million, delivering a 6% increase YoY and 26% decline QoQ. Animal 
Healthcare accounts for 10% of our total revenues.  
 
Turning to Bioprocessing, this segment recorded strong growth of 52% during the quarter, reaching INR 255 million and 8% sequential 
growth. This growth is primarily on account of robust performance of our food business. The food business grew by 77% on YoY basis 
and 18% on QoQ basis. The Non-Food business underperformed during the quarter. It de-grew by 4% on YoY basis and 20% on QoQ 
basis. 
 
Lastly, the Specialized Manufacturing segment delivered a strong growth of 54% on YoY basis and 30% on sequential basis, reaching 
INR 185 million. This segment represents 10% of our overall revenue. We anticipate that our strong growth trajectory will continue 
across all business segments in the foreseeable future. 
 
With this, I will now hand over the call to Rauka Ji. He will walk you through the financials and key subsidiary numbers. Thank you.

That was from my side. Now, we shall open the floor for question-and-answer session. 
 
Moderator: 
Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. If you have a question, please press * and 
1 on your telephone keypad and wait for your turn to ask the question. If you would like to withdraw your request, you may do so by 
pressing * and 1 again. 
 
The first question comes from Rachna K from SCIL Ventures. Please go ahead, ma'am. 
 
Rachna K: 
Thank you for the Opportunity, and congrats on a good set of numbers. I have a couple of questions. My first question would be, could 
you provide color on how could we achieve YoY good growth rate across our geographies like India, Europe, and Asia? And wh at 
caused a slight decline in USA? If you could please provide share on drivers of growth for this quarter across each geography individ-
ually. This is my first question. 
 
Beni Rauka: 
We will give you some numbers. Okay? What is the next question? 
 
Rachna K: 
Similarly, for our product categories, animal healthcare, human healthcare, food processing and specialized manufacturing. And what 
were the growth drivers? If you could give some color on each category separately? And what caused a decline in industrial processing 
revenues to remain for that? And do we see the growth trajectory sustaining over the long term? These would be my questions. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
So, good evening, Rachna Ji. I would say this way, when we talk about India, Europe, all the different  names, numbers can be given 
by Rauka Ji. But in general, it's, marketing we're putting up from last so many days into the different areas, different geographies, Asia, 
as well as Europe. And all of this, it's a long-term, like, efforts. You cannot just, go and say that in one day, go , come and can go. So, 
I would put it this way. It's into the all the different segments which we are working. 
Page 5 of 22 
 
 
In Europe, we were working into the baking areas . We were working into those different food areas. In India as well, we are working 
on a different food areas. In other market, Asian markets, we are working into the different pharma areas.  And all of those, give you 
some effect. 
 
At the same time, we did have, some back footing be cause of the tariff issues, which is there. And what we anticipated, little more 
growth because of tariff issues, which are still there, and we anticipate that may continue. We don't know when it will be be cause the 
uncertainty is there. And, probably, that is the one area which has caused a little bit lower sales in the US as of now. 
 
And also, in some of the areas where the indirect market is there. So , we are waiting how this tariff issues pan out to make further 
strategies, what we should do, what we shouldn't do. But what I would like to say that it's like long-term efforts, which are turning into 
the some sort of growth. 
 
Beni Rauka: 
Yeah. I would like to give you the numbers. So total revenue, 50% has come from India on six-month basis, YTD FY26. The 30% has 
come from Americas where we see a decline of 4% in our numbers as compared to last year's six months. Europe is about 6% of our 
revenue, and we have seen 51% of growth from this geography. 
 
Asia is about 12% of our revenue coming from there in the six months of current year, and we have seen 4% of growth in this particular 
geography. The rest of the world, which constitute about 2% of our revenue, and 30% increase in six months period. Do you need 
absolute number or you'll get some idea from this? 
 
Rachna K: 
I'll get some idea. And on product categories, if you could give some color. 
 
Beni Rauka: 
I mean, product categories, in what sense you are saying? Anti-inflammatory product. 
 
Rachna K: 
Yeah. The drivers of growth because the growth rates this quarter are very good. So, just wanted an idea on those aspects. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
It's all the different areas and different products , every everything is showing growth. If you really look at it, our anti -inflammatory 
product growth is also there. Our baking enzyme's growth are also there. Animal feed enzymes also there. 
 
So, all of them are growing at this point of time. There are a lot of research which is happening. Those are also supporting into some 
of the areas, and those are also going to support in the future. So, that's all what I can say as of now, Rachna Ji. 
 
Rachna K: 
Okay. Thank you. And one more question. How will we offset the impact of tariffs? You said we have some strategies in place. So, if 
you could provide some color on that as well. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
Rachna Ji, I don't want to reveal those strategies. We will wait and see how the things pan out, and then we will take appropriate call 
at a given time. How do we need to do? We are still working on different area. If this persists, then what we need to do? 
 
Page 6 of 22 
 
Rachna K: 
And how do you think the growth in H2 FY26 will pan out? If you could provide some color on that as well. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
There are a lot of uncertainties out there. What I would say is that we will still stick with the numbers and the initial guidance what we 
have given that we will have this year, like, a mid-double digit growth. And I would like to continue with that as of now, and we'll see 
how the things pan out in the given t ime because I see a lot of uncertainties around the world. So , I don't want to comment too many 
things as of now. 
 
Rachna K: 
Okay. Thank you so much. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
Thank you. 
 
Moderator: 
Thank you. So, next question comes from mister Umang Shah: from Banyan Cleaver Advisors. Please go ahead, sir. 
 
Umang Shah: 
Hello. Am I audible? 
 
Beni Rauka: 
Yes, Umang Ji. You can be a little louder. 
 
Umang Shah: 
Okay. Sure. Hi, sir. Congratulations on good set of numbers, and thank you for the opportunity. Sir, I have two questions. 
 
First one, the specialized manufacturing business. Right? Last two years, the bottom line is around INR 4 crores or so in that subsidiary. 
At what scale do you think the margins will scale up? And what is the current line?  And where do you think the margins will land at 
for next two years? 
 
Beni Rauka: 
I mean, see, margin in that particular business is really low. And currently a lot of expansion is happening. So I think, the depreciation 
expenses have gone up and capacity utilization has also gone up. But yet, the margin is low in that particular segment. And particularly, 
when you have, the geography -wise, if you look at the numbers, then I think the domestic market little bit more competitive in the 
sense in getting the kind of the margins. 
 
So, I think we will go wi th the same kind of margin that is what we had in the last year. In this particular company, I think, maybe, 
about 8% to 10% of the kind of the margins we are going to have. 
 
Umang Shah: 
Okay. Sure, sir. Very helpful, sir. Sir, and how is the competitive intensity for serratiopeptidase in India? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
Competition is always there, Umang Ji, and it will continue. 
 
Page 7 of 22 
 
Umang Shah: 
Right. No. Because last year, the competition had significantly increased after many years. So , do we continue with that intense com-
petition or now you see that the rates are still forming up? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
No. I would say that rates are more or less stable. And competition is going to be there, and then you need to deal with the competition 
with whatever the tools which you have. 
 
Umang Shah: 
Right, sir. And, sir, in the last call, you had helpfully mentione d the total impact on our profits for the full year if the U S tariffs go to 
50%. Now, they are at 50%. So, do we work with those numbers? 
 
And right now, what are the conversations like with our customers? Are they taking some impact of the tariffs? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
As like last time also, like, I think, like, we mention ed that at the worst case, we will have a 2% impact on the EBITDA if we absorb 
everything going forward as well. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
The way we will work it out is some of them probably will absorb. Some of them will try to pass it on. It depends on the customer. It 
depends on the strategies. It also depends on the volume of the customer, size of the customers, and what different actions w hich we 
need to take. 
 
But still, it's absorbable if the volume goes up. So, we are open on that as of now, and we'll see how it works out. 
 
Umang Shah: 
Got it. Thank you so much, sir. All the best. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
Thank you, Umang Ji. 
 
Moderator: 
Thank you so much, sir. The next question comes from Mr. Raman KV from Sequent Investments. Please go ahead, sir. 
 
Raman KV: 
Hello. Can you hear me? 
 
Beni Rauka: 
Yes. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
Yes, Raman Ji. 
 
  
Page 8 of 22 
 
Raman KV: 
Good evening, sir. Thank you for the opportunity. I'm fairly new to the company. If you don't  mind, can you please explain me the 
business vertical? And my second question is, what are the key growth drivers for your double -digit growth for the year?  As in, are 
you planning to launch more product or are you planning to scale the existing products? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
So, Raman Ji, the business segments what we have and we have mentioned on our presentation on the website as well, but I will just 
for your information, I will give you in short. So, we do have our nutraceutical business where, like, all the pharma and Nutra business 
is a part of it. Second one is bioprocessing business where food and non-food business is a part of it, and the third one is animal feed 
business. 
 
And I would like to say that the g rowth is always with the existing products as well as the new products. We are more R&D-driven 
company. We heavily work from the R&Ds, and the new products and new launches are always into the pipelines. But all the products 
don't scale up that fast or that quickly. There is always some time lag in our area. And we intend to increase our R&D intensity as well 
going forward. We are coming up with the new R&D center as well where we would increase our R&D capacity multifold than what 
we have at present. 
 
So, the simple answer is it's a combination of both existing products as well as the new products what we are going to launch. Some of 
them not maybe like individual form, maybe in the blends and formulation form. 
 
Raman KV: 
Understood, sir. Sir, while looking at the historical figures, I have noticed that our historical margin before COVID, it was around 44% 
to 46%. Can we assume this 30% to 32% kind of margin is the new normal? Or can we go back to the 44% margin? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
Since the last few calls also, we are saying that at this point of time, our view is this is going to be the new normal for us. If it improves, 
it is good, but we will go with these numbers as of now. 
 
Raman KV: 
Okay, sir. And so my last question, it's more of a doubt. If you can give ballpark figures, which is a better margin business amongst all 
the vertical? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
It's we don't really track with the different products, different margins, different areas to that level. But I would say that all of the 
segments are more or less equal. But whenever there is a sale from our US subsidiary, it adds up to the margins. 
 
Raman KV: 
Understood, sir. Thank you, sir. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
Thank you, Raman Ji. 
 
Moderator: 
Thank you, sir. The next question comes from Mr. Lakshmi Narayan from Tunga Investments. Please go ahead, sir. 
 
  
Page 9 of 22 
 
Lakshmi Narayan: 
Thank you. I just want to understand our largest product sales. What has been the sales for the last six months versus the previous-year 
six months? 
 
Beni Rauka: 
Yeah, Lakshmi Narayan ji, INR 829 million as compared to INR 555 million. 
 
Lakshmi Narayan: 
Okay. And if you look at it, what is our India market? This is entirely domestic, I believe. Right? Now in this, what is the total market 
size for this product? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
It's difficult, Lakshmi Narayan Ji. But I would say that we command maximum percentage of it. 
 
Lakshmi Narayan: 
Okay. I mean, when you say, is it another 35% or 20% more would be that? I mean, I just want to understand what is the broad number? 
What is the range it should be? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
See, the application can be different. It can be into the other areas as well. You can extend the applications. Right? So, it's very difficult 
to put it into the actual number. So, that's a challenge Lakshmi Narayan Ji to tell you exact number. 
 
Lakshmi Narayan: 
Got it. Now , how many players are there right now? Because the market itself is around INR 200 crores or so, I mean, then it's a 
different thing as well as when the market is large. So , because it needs a minimum order, minimum size for somebody to set up this 
particular product. Correct? Now in your view, what is the minimum revenue somebody has to generate to actually enter  into this 
particular business? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
I would put it this way, individual single product, probably, it's very difficult to survive. You need to have different batteries of the 
products. You need to have different products. You need to take the capacity utilization very differently. Because just giving the one 
product doesn't work out. 
 
Lakshmi Narayan: 
Got it. Thanks. Sir, and we talked about the American business and there has been tariff impact. Now, is it that the entire product that 
are being shipped to the US  suffers from this tariff? Can you just tell me what is  the percentage? Because there is if you add value, 
then the tariff becomes different, right? So, what is the weighted average thing for this? And then how do you -- what kind of mitigation 
you can actually do? 
 
I know you talked about some of the things like 2% is an impact. Just want to understand how much would get suffered with this tariff? 
And then what is the weighted average? And then what are your mitigations? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
If I go with the last year's number, at the worst scenario, probably, like, we'll have impact of INR 7 crores, INR 8 crores. 
 
  
Page 10 of 22 
 
Lakshmi Narayan: 
Okay. In the EBITDA? 
 
Beni Rauka: 
Yeah. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
Yeah. I mean, like, total whatever we can call PAT, EBITDA or Gross margin. 
 
Lakshmi Narayan: 
Sorry, sir. I didn't get a clear end. 
 
Beni Rauka: 
So, INR 10 crore to INR 11 crore is impact on EBITDA and INR 7 crore to INR 8 crore on PAT on overall basis. 
 
Lakshmi Narayan: 
And how do you intend to mitigate it? Is there a way that you can mitigate by changing the source of origination or keeping t he place 
at which the value is being added. Is there something which you can mitigate? 
 
Beni Rauka: 
Yeah. I think that's what we are working on. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
We'll explore all of those areas. 
 
Lakshmi Narayan: 
Sir, and if you look at India, non -pharma business. Right? So can you just give me a bit of India non -pharma and how it has actually 
grown? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
So, when we talk about India, non -pharma, it is basically textile and leather, and we mentioned many times that that is not our focus 
area, Lakshmi Narayan Ji, but we intend to be there and see how is the market moving. Maybe, like, in the future, we will like to come 
out with the products into those areas. 
 
Lakshmi Narayan: 
Yeah. Because I thought there is a sizable amount of animal feed business. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
Animal feed doesn't come into the non-food areas. The non-food areas basically comprises of textiles and leather. 
 
Lakshmi Narayan: 
I talked about -- I was looking for non-pharma, sir. Sorry. I think I wanted to know the non-pharma part of India. What is the revenue 
that is actually for the last six months and how it has grown, okay, excluding pharma domestic sales? 
 
  
Page 11 of 22 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
Rauka Ji can give the numbers of the food business, how it has grown, and basically, the other one is the animal feed. Overall numbers, 
we don't have numbers, like, separately, geography-wise or others. Right? So, you can give the six-month comparison, Rauka Ji. 
 
Beni Rauka: 
Okay. So, I'm just giving you a number for food segment. So for six months, it is about INR 380 million as compared to INR 312 
million. And other than that, the animal health, the animal feed business, that is what we call it, is INR 453 million as compared to INR 
353 million in last year's six months. 
 
Lakshmi Narayan: 
Is this India? 
 
Beni Rauka: 
No. It's not India. It's all, like, India plus international. Total number I'm giving you. 
 
Lakshmi Narayan: 
Okay. So, then moving on to Europe, which has also grown for us, can you just give me a bit of what is growing in the Europe? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
No. I would put it, like, say, Lakshmi Narayan Ji, we shouldn't  go on a QoQ or half yearly basis. Overall yearly basis, it has more 
relevance. I would say that the focus area is still the same. What we have into the food areas and particularly into some of the nutraceu-
tical areas, which is still there into the Europe, we are registering our few products in the EFSA, and we are waiting for the novel food 
approval. 
 
If that works out, then probably, the Europe business can grow much faster. Similarly, we are waiting for some of the approva ls for 
some of the pharma areas into the Asian areas. If those happens, probably, that should, really increase the growth into thos e areas as 
well, particularly. It's a long , time-consuming process. The process we started one and a half years back, and still we are waiting.  
Maybe like six months to eight months down the line, we expect that, that should materialize. 
 
Lakshmi Narayan: 
Sir, one just last question. The American business has shown a little slower growth. So , is it completely related to tariffs? Or it is 
something outside the tariff issue that is actually leading to this? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
We don't know at this point of time, Lakshmi Narayan: Ji, but what we can say that into the last particularly last two, three months, 
there is a lot of slowness what we have observed. The number of inquiries which used to be, let's say, about hundred in a month dropped 
down to four, five, six new inquiries. So, that just shows that there is a lot of slowness which is happening into the market. 
 
Now, is it because of the tariff or some others or because of the price rise, what is happening into the year? We still need to wa it and 
watch. But what I would like to say that there is some slowness which we can see, and we believe that it has to do more with the tariff 
and other cost increase what is happening in US. 
 
Lakshmi Narayan: 
Thank you. I will come back in queue.

Moderator: 
Thank you, sir. The next question comes from Mr. Nitish Rege from Chrys Capital. Please go ahead, sir. 
 
Nitish Rege: 
Hi. Thank you for the opportunity. Hope, I'm audible. Just a question on the guidance which you said you want to maintain at the mid-
teens level. So, you expect to which our revenue growth rate to decline?  
We've done 23% YoY in the first half. So, if you can do mid-teens, we expect to which to be a slower growth for us? 
 
Beni Rauka: 
I think, that's what we have been telling because of a lot of uncertainties around the world. We feel like, we need to have the same 
guidance for the time being. 
 
Nitish Rege: 
Got it. And just if you could share some color on margins, do you expect it to be at this 32.5% EBITDA margin levels going at? 
 
Beni Rauka: 
I'm sorry. I did not get. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
Margins. 
 
Beni Rauka: 
The margin, I think, we already mentioned, except, like, the impact of the tariff. Otherwise, I think we will continue to have the margin 
of PAT about 21% to 22%, EBITDA of 30% to 32%. That's what we are still managing. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
I would say that still, like, we will not go with the QoQ. I would still like to see more certainties as to, I mean some more clear picture 
how the whole situations pan out. As of now, what we are trying, we are getting some results. We expect some more results.  Some of 
the results didn't come up because of tariff issues and other issues. So, we'll wait and see -- wait and watch how the things pan out. 
 
Nitish Rege: 
Got it. And, sir, we've got close to INR 600 crores of cash on our balance sheet right now. Is there any M&A we're targeting or any 
such acquisitions where you have in mind you're assessing right now? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
So, acquisitions and other things are always there in the mind. We always work. We are working on few of them, but it always depends 
on the cost and what we are getting out of it. So, we don't know whether it will happen or it will not happen as of now. 
 
Nitish Rege: 
But, like, are we looking for targets which are in the human nutrition or in the industrial bioprocessing? Any anything we're favoring? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
I mean, that's an ongoing process. 
Page 13 of 22 
 
 
Beni Rauka: 
It's more of, in a forward integration. We are looking at the animal feed business, of c ourse. In human nutrition, we are looking more 
at probiotics. That's the area of our interest. 
 
Nitish Rege: 
Okay. And just lastly from my side, what traction are we seeing on the bio-catalyst side? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
We do have a lot of  good traction which is coming up. We do see that there are a lot of products which are into the pipeline, and 
probably, they should also add up to the growth going next year. Some, maybe the last quarters. We will see, wait and watch how the 
things pan out. 
 
Nitish Rege: 
Can you quantify the number? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
I won't be able to, Rauka Ji can give the numbers, but the market work which is going on, that's all what I can say as of now. But Rauka 
Ji can give the number. 
 
Beni Rauka: 
So, I think bio-catalysis total for six months stood about, INR 128 million as compared to INR 104 million last year. 
 
Nitish Rege: 
Got it. Thank you so much. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
Thank you. 
 
Beni Rauka: 
Thank you. 
 
Moderator: 
Thank you, sir. The next question comes from Mr. Rajas Joshi from Chrys capital. Please go ahead, sir. 
 
Rajas Joshi: 
Yes. Good afternoon and thank you for the opportunity. Sir, I just wanted to get your sense on the growth that we reported bo th for 
earlier quarter and this quarter. How sustainable is this growth? And are there any one-offs per se, so to speak, in the numbers for H1, 
both with regards to revenue and/or margin? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
I would say that there is no one-off, but there is not every quarter we get the same -- I would say, the same orders. Some quarters maybe 
here and there -- few here and there. But I would say this is a little bit long -term growth rather than, we just go with a QoQ basis. So, 
it's difficult. There is no one -off customers, but we still need to wait for how this tariff comes up because there are a lot of time, the 
indirect sales are also there, which also goes to the US. 
 
Page 14 of 22 
 
So, we need to wait and watch how the things pan out. 
 
Rajas Joshi: 
Understood, sir. And  has the strategy in any sense changed, especially, I mean, with regards to, let's say, sales and marketing or, 
business development? Any other kind of change in strategy that you've done over the past one year or that you would like to highlight 
specifically? 
 
Beni Rauka: 
No comment. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
I don't want to comment on that, Rajas Ji. 
 
Rajas Joshi: 
Okay. Understood, sir. And secondly, on the gross margin, right? So I mean, Q4 was kind of the bottom. And then last Q1 also,  we 
were about, I think, 73%-odd. And this quarter now, we've given about 76%-odd in terms of gross margins. And if I look at the sales 
in the US, which is rightly, as you rightly said, a higher margin market for us, QoQ basis sales are down for this high-margin market, 
then what is really driving this gross margin expansion per se on a QoQ basis? 
 
Beni Rauka: 
So, all operational efficiency is driving. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
Operational efficiency as well as your some of the research is there and some of the, product mix which varies with quarter to quarter. 
 
Rajas Joshi: 
On mix, could you highlight what exactly is higher margin and what is lower margin? It should help us understand going ahead as well 
how we should think of gross margin. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
I think for you, it will be diff icult to, arrive at such things, frankly speaking  because of the complex ity. We have animal nutrition, 
human nutrition, biocatalyst, probiotics. So, I mean, it's very difficult to drive in that sense, those numbers. 
 
Rajas Joshi: 
Okay. Even qualitatively, not from a number perspective, if you could come in let's say, animal nutrition is high margin or some other 
product is low margin. Anything of that sort? 
 
Beni Rauka: 
No, I don't think we will be able to give you that kind of guidance. 
 
Rajas Joshi: 
Okay. All right. Thanks a lot, sir. 
 
Moderator: 
Thank you, sir. The next question comes from Zakinaher Nasser: from Nasser Investments. Please go ahead. 
 
Page 15 of 22 
 
Zakinaher Nasser: 
Sir, congratulations on a very strong set of numbers. Sir, you've given a guidance of a mid-teens growth, which I think is on the cards. 
But sir, how do you foresee the company three years from now? How do you want Advance d Enzymes to shape out as a company in 
the global scenario? So because it's a complex company where the products itself are pretty complex. 
 
And also, I would like you to throw some light on your sector of industrial and bioprocessing. What do you foresee that because that 
has had a good growth this quarter, sir? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
So if you ask me, we always wanted to maintain the growth trajectory of mid-teen over a longer period on an average, if I would like 
to say. So, that's our always a goal. In terms of bioprocessing and all of these different areas, we are coming out with different new 
geographies. We are adding up new products what we are working on. Some of them are in the R&D. Some of them are into the final 
stages. Some of them, we already added and marketed into the market. Right? 
 
So to support t hat, you need to add more  geographies, just not dependent on the baking. So , we are working into the different areas 
into the food categories as well, and we are coming out with the new products, new R&Ds. And that is how, we are working on the 
bioprocessing, and that is how, we need to grow in each and every areas. 
 
Zakinaher Nasser: 
Sir, and would you have a broad idea of what your share in the world market would be? Or how large would Advanced Enzymes be as 
a world player, sir? Would you have 10% to 15% market share or more, sir, in this area? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
I would say that we are very small. Even though we will be among the top five or top ten players, there are very few companies in the 
world. If you just go and compare, the revenues of the biggest, like, Novozymes or Novonesis right now, we are very, very small. So, 
we won't be commenting, 5% of the share in the world market. Probably, like… 
 
Beni Rauka: 
Less than 2%. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
Less than 2%. Somewhere around that. That is what I wish is as of now. 
 
Zakinaher Nasser: 
So, there is a huge headroom, sir, if things -- if you have a good couple of years. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
Yeah. But that has to be supported with lot of R&D. And th is is a complex business, as we always say. Right? But needs a lot of 
research, and that is what, our focus is going forward as well. 
 
Zakinaher Nasser: 
Thank you, sir. Best wishes. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
Thank you.

Moderator: 
Thank you so much, sir. The next question comes from Mr. Shreyans Gathani from SG Securities. Please go ahead, sir. 
 
Shreyans Gathani 
Hi. Good afternoon, Mukund Ji and Rauka Ji. So, I had a couple of questions. So, the first one was that we've seen like a big pickup in 
high protein foods in India, especially, like, high-protein yogurts and milk. So, are we providing any kind of enzymes towards those, 
like, specifically, like lactase or in that particular area? And what kind of growth are you looking at? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
We are working on to those areas. As of now, we do have certain products under the trial. Yeah. Even though, our Indian market share 
is smaller into those areas. In India, there are little different challenges, but we are overcoming on those. And you need to have a lot of 
different product batteries. 
 
Like, when we talk about lactase, there are a couple of types of lactase, particularly into this area prevailing, you need a neutral lactase. 
We do have a very good acid lactase. Neutr al lactase is also under the R&D. There are a lot of different aspartic enzymes, proteases, 
and all of those are also into the customer testing phases and all of that. 
 
So, yeah, in giving the short answers, we are working into those areas. As of now, we don't have too much of the sale in Indian market, 
particularly, of those, but those are the products under different stage of development. 
 
Shreyans Gathani 
Okay. So, we are in testing phase. We developed the product is what I can understand. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
Sorry? 
 
Shreyans Gathani 
Is it under, like, customer testing or what favorable yet? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
There are lot of different products. Right? So, some of them are at the customer testing. Some of them are, like, in our lab testing. Some 
of them are under the development stage as well. 
 
Shreyans Gathani 
Okay. And second question was on the B2C India business. So , how do you see that shaping up? Any kind of traction that we are 
seeing? And what's the strategy over there? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
So we are, like, main B2B company, and that is where, we are separating that arm from Advanced Enzymes to the new company what 
we just recently formed. So , we will be transferring that business. As of now, like, we do have a good growth on a smaller number. 
This year, probably, we'll be hitting somewhere around INR 1 CR to INR 1.5 CR, which is lower than what we budgeted initially. But 
we'll see. And there is a young dynamic team which is working behind it, and it's a different company. That's what we are trying to aim 
at it to develop it further. 
 
Shreyans Gathani 
Got it. And actually, is there any update on how we are going with the R&D center and what plans of hiring and all people in that? 
Page 17 of 22 
 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
So, R&D is actually at different stages. And I have to put it this way. Probably, by the end of the March, it should have some kind o f 
shape should come up, and, probably, we are targeting to capitalize some of the assets during that time. It will partially become active 
by the end of this fiscal year. 
 
Shreyans Gathani 
By March? Okay. Got it. And last is, the European subsidiary, we had an order, like, any kind of similar orders we're looking at? We 
did see, like, a revenue jump there. So, if you could give some color on how that is doing and just some update on it. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
European subsidiary i s more of a R&D, but we are working on some of the similar contracts out there. Some of them are on the 
advanced stages. And we see a good growth if those materializes maybe in next one year down the line and two years down the line. 
But we will wait and see how the things work out because some of them are under still at the development stages for that. 
 
Shreyans Gathani 
Okay. Got it. All right. That's all from my end. Thank you so much. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
Thank you. 
 
Moderator: 
Thank you, sir. The next question comes from Mr. Aditya Khandelwal from Simpl. Please go ahead, sir. 
 
Aditya Khandelwal: 
Yeah. Hi, sir. Thanks for the opportunity. Sir, this question has been asked before, but I'll also try my luck. So, see, the growth which 
we have witnessed in the first half, more than 20%. So, if you could just provide some flavor of what is leading to such high growth? 
 
So, is it that we have one new customer or some of our products have clicked, which is leading to the high growth? Or is it just purely 
a base effect playing out? So if you could just spend some time and help us understand what is leading to this high growth? 
 
Beni Rauka: 
So, we are getting good growth in all four segments. In human nutrition, we are getting a good growth of about 21%. This is our largest 
business. And here, we have different products and different product mix. So, many of, products are getting good orders. And because 
of that, I think the growth is good in this particular segment. 
 
In animal health segment, again, we are getting 28% of growth. So, that is coming from India as well as from the international market. 
And this is because, mainly, we have done a lot of work in last three, four years. So, I think we are getting now a lot of orders from our 
customers. And bioprocessing food is another area where we see the good growth of 22%. 
 
So, all these segments are doing well in these two quarters, and there are several things because the efforts have gone in the pa st, and 
now you are getting those kinds of numbers from different customers. So, it's not only one particular thing which we can say, okay, it's 
only because of A, B, C, D, reason. There are several things which has gone back into getting this kind of support and numbers. 
 
Page 18 of 22 
 
We will look at the contract manufacturing business, I mean, there, we have effervescent based technology, and we could see 42% of 
growth in this particular business as well, which is run by our subsidiary company.  So, all put together is given a kind of growth of 
23%. 
 
Moderator: 
Thank you, sir. We'll take up the next question from Mr. Abhishek Kohli:, an Indian investor. Please go ahead, sir. 
 
Abhishek Kohli: 
Am I audible, sir? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
Yes, Abhishek Ji. 
 
Abhishek Kohli: 
My question one is, I see high inventory in your balance sheet. Is it, like, in preparation for US tariffs that you are maintaining this high 
inventory? That's my question one. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
Abhishek Ji, in our business, the inventory is a lways there. If you look into the historically as well, you will see that the inventory is 
always there because we have multiple different products, different locations. The product cycle is bigger. Let's say if you want to 
make one product today, you will at least need one month's time. That too depends on, whether the capacity is available because when 
there are multiple products, there are different batch campaigning as well happens. 
 
At the same time, we have different plant locations in India as well as out of India. So, that makes it always our -- and the delivery time 
has to be as short as possible. So, we are historically as well in inventory levels. 
 
Abhishek Kohli: 
Okay. So as of now, there is a business between India and US, as in you are able to do that despite these tariffs? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
We anticipated that, and we did some movement into the first qu arter to the US, some of them, which can take care of another one 
quarter or so, one and a half quarter. 
 
Abhishek Kohli: 
Okay. Yes. That was actually my question. Because I see INR 173 crores inventory, which looks big compared to your past. So I was 
asking, like, were you preparing for that in the form of finished goods? 
 
Beni Rauka: 
A little bit built-up. Yes. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
A little bit built-up. 
 
Abhishek Kohli: 
Yeah. Question two. I think two quarters back, I think I remember you mentioned about a pharma intermediate that was in pilot stage. 
Any update on the commercial orders for that pharma intermediate? 
Page 19 of 22 
 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
We had few, but there are a few challenges as well, which we are working. We are working on few of the intermediates as of no w. 
We'll see how it's pan out. And probably, after one or two quarters, maybe, we'll be able to more highlight on that. 
 
Abhishek Kohli: 
Okay. And my question three. This is my final question. I remember, like, our CFO mentioning that there was a reduction in the number 
of inquiries. Despite that, you are guiding for mid-teens growth. Like, my main question is, will this reduction in inquiries be affecting 
the H2 or next fiscal year, '27? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
So, this is already affected, if you really look at it, our US sales is down by 7%, 8%, whatever that number is. So, it's already affecting 
us to some level because we feel some of the slowness. If we really go back and when we were calculating, we were anticipating some 
9%, 10% of growth in the US business this year, but this has already affected us. 
 
Abhishek Kohli: 
Okay. And US, this tariff-related slowdown, is it, like, affecting only your US business or is it affecting, like, the global supply chain 
what is the feeling as of now? 
 
Beni Rauka: 
Right. It's mainly US business. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
It's mainly the US business and some of the indirect US business. 
 
Abhishek Kohli: 
Okay. The reason I'm asking is, like, your businesses are more counter-cyclical business, right, like, precision-proof business because 
food and pharma, these products, textiles anyway. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
No. I will put it this way. Our enzymes go into the pharma intermediates as well. But also, most of the enzymes categorized in US as 
a nutraceutical enzymes. So, when it goes to the nutraceutical, let's say, if I'm selling some enzymes to the tablet-manufacturing com-
pany and they are exporting to the US, that is not happening because of the 50% tariff which is there onto their final products as well. 
So, that's all, indirectly also, it affects, and it did affect us into the last one or two quarters. 
 
Abhishek Kohli: 
Then a really fantastic job actually what you guys did despite all these headwinds, a 20% growth rate. I think without that, it could 
have been, like, a more than -- I think close to 30%, right, by what you're saying. Thanks a lot. Great job. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
Thank you, Abhishek. 
 
Moderator: 
Thank you, sir. We have a follow-up question from Mr. Lakshmi Narayan from Tunga Investments. Please go ahead, sir. 
 
  
Page 20 of 22 
 
Lakshmi Narayan: 
Yes. Sir, just wanted to understand whether people who are taking material from us in US, have they found alternate supply sources ? 
That is about one. 
 
And second, with respect to the growth in Asia, the growth has been stupendous. Can you just help me understand what are the levers 
of growth in Asia and this US question, please? Thank you. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
I will put it this way, Lakshmi Narayan: Ji, I don't see there is an ultimate supply or this. We haven't raised the prices or anything as of 
now to a level which it should be. Right? And we are not we might take some hits as well, as we are saying, and we will wait and watch 
how the things pan out. 
 
One thing what we ca n look at it as of now is,  everywhere there is going to be a price increase in the US, which will happen by the 
next year. This is what our anticipation is. As of now, we'll wait and see how things pan out in the US. 
 
What was your second question was Asia? 
 
Lakshmi Narayan: 
Yeah. Asia. What led to the growth in Asia and in which segment? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
See, so nothing happens in one day, Lakshmi Narayan Ji. You need to do a lot of registrations and other things, and it's efforts of last 
one, two years what you put in. This starts getting materialized. Right? So , nothing is in a one -day process or this process. We were 
working on it. We got some success. We are still working on some of the geographies, and we'll wait for those geographies to materi-
alize. 
 
Lakshmi Narayan: 
Is it animal feed or is it human nutrition? What actually drove the growth in Asia, sir? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
It's all the segment, I would say. Except food, I would put it more into the animal feed and into the human nutrition business. 
 
Lakshmi Narayan: 
Got it, sir. 
 
Beni Rauka: 
Other than US, Asia business as well. 
 
Lakshmi Narayan: 
Got it, sir. Thank you so much.

Thank you, sir. The next we have a follow-up question from Mr. Umang Shah: from Banyan Tree Advisors. Please go ahead, sir. 
 
  
Page 21 of 22 
 
Umang Shah: 
Hi, sir. Thank you for the opportunity again. Sir, sometime back, Rauka Ji had mentioned on one of the calls that our market share in 
US is 15%. Just wanted to confirm the number, is the understanding correct? 
 
Beni Rauka: 
A 15% of I think we must have mentioned about the nutraceutical and that too, I think, the bulk. Right? 
 
Umang Shah: 
Yes. In nutraceutical market in US. That is the right understanding. Right? 
 
Beni Rauka: 
Yeah. Right. 
 
Umang Shah: 
And in that, with that 15%, what would be our rank? Would we be first, second, third, fourth? 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
I think there are three, four players. 
 
Beni Rauka: 
Yes. 
 
Umang Shah: 
Okay. Three, four players ahead of us or three, four players in the market? 
 
Beni Rauka: 
No. They are ahead of us. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
Major. I would say that three players. So, you will be one of them. There will be some small players. 
 
Umang Shah: 
Sure, sir. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
Mainly three, four players. 
 
Umang Shah: 
Sure, sir. Sir and the second question was this  food business revenue that we've got in this quarter, is it sustainable or is it based on a 
contract or onetime? Because previously, also, we have seen some volatility in this segment. 
 
Mukund Kabra: 
I would not say that it's a onetime business. I would say that, some of the -- I would still go with not a QoQ. Some quarters, probably, 
you will have a lower, but I would say that this is a more sustainable business. 
 
  
Page 22 of 22 
 
Umang Shah: 
Right, sir. Got it, sir. And just last one thing, R&D expenses, is it simply a function of higher sales due to which they have declined or 
has it also ramped down? 
 
Beni Rauka: 
I think an absolute number, we have about, INR 19 crore or so. 
 
Umang Shah: 
Okay. 
 
Beni Rauka: 
This year, six months, and last year also, the similar number. We are spending lot of money. We hav e not capitalized, so we are not 
taking those numbers into account when we are talking about our total R&D spend. 
 
Umang Shah: 
Sure, sir. And, sir, once the R&D center comes on stream next year, how much R&D are we budgeting from the P&L? 
 
Beni Rauka: 
So, I think this will increase substantially in the sense, supposing we are spending, say, about INR 25 crores. So roughly, for the next 
year, it is going to go about INR 10 crores to INR 12 crores higher than whatever we are going to spend in FY 26. And gradually, it 
will ramp up. 
 
Umang Shah: 
Got it. Thank you so much, sir.
