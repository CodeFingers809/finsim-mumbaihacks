Adani Execution Engine: Execution Risk Mitigation – What We Are Doing Differently
Brownfield development model:
• Ready availability of land, water, project power, 
and other key enablers
• Shared infrastructure with existing capacities
• Reduced execution timeline
Execution Assurance
Availability Risk:
• Linkages earmarked by DISCOM for each PPA 
bid, providing clarity and uniformity to 
developers
• Additional Fuel Supply Agreement mechanism 
to address shortfall in FSA coal
Fuel Assurance
High visibility of cash flows:
• 90% capacity under PPAs with two-part, 
availability-based tariff provides EBITDA 
predictability without dispatch risk.
• Fuel price risk mitigation through escalation and 
pass-through mechanisms enhances EBITDA 
stability
Finance Assurance
MU: Million Units | BU: Billion Units | MT: Million Tonnes | MTPA: Million Tonnes Per Annum | EBITDA: Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortisation | MW: Mega Watts | GW: Giga Watts | PPA: Power Purchase Agreement | O&M: Operations & 
Maintenance | kWh: kilo Watt hours | DISCOM: Distribution Company | FSA: Fuel Supply Agreement | BTG: Boilers, Turbines, and Generators
Project execution control:
• Adani Infra: In-house project management 
through multi-disciplinary teams 
• Package Contract model for finer control on 
execution and better back-to-back assurances
Project supply chain assurance:
• Advance booking of 22.4 GW Boiler, Turbine, 
and Generator (BTG) equipment to ensure 
timely deliveries
• Extensive vendor development to build up 
ecosystem for other packages
Price Risk:
• Pass through of fuel cost with adequate 
Change-in-law protection
• Alternate fuel supply cost recovery
In-house Strengths:
• APL is developing four coal mines with 14 MTPA 
production capacity
• Enhanced fuel security for untied capacities, no 
end-use restrictions
• Logistics assurance through Adani Logistics
Self-funded development:
• Sufficient cash flow generating ability to meet 
entire capex outlay
• Access to debt capital market for funding growth
• No risk of project delay on account of financial 
closure requirements
Improved Credit Profile:
• Low leverage and high liquidity provide ample 
growth headroom
• AA rated by four leading domestic rating 
agencies

Coal is Critical for India : Coal is Key to Long-Term Reliability and Affordability of Base Load Supply 
Abundant Coal

Key Base Load

Limited Natural 
Gas Availability
Unequivocal 
support for Coal
✓ India meets 1Bn+ tonnes coal demand domestically, with 437 
Bn+ tonnes in reserves ensuring long-term energy security.
✓ Reduced imports and rising dispatches reinforce energy 
independence and cost savings.
✓ Coal remains the backbone of India’s baseload power → 
delivering stable, large-scale supply amid rising demand & 
renewable variability .
✓ Coal ensures Grid Stability and dispatchable power → Critical 
for balancing India’s evolving energy mix.
✓ Import dependency → 50% of total consumption is costly 
imported LNG
✓ High Power Cost → INR 6-8/kWh for LNG based vs INR 4-5 
/kWh for Imported Coal & INR 2-3/kWh for Domestic Coal 
✓ 90% of gas used for non electricity Sector
✓ Strong push for domestic production growth →15% growth 
target for FY 2025-26
✓ Supportive policies for coal allocation (e.g. SHAKTI)
✓ Allocation of coal to States for 30 GW of new capacity under 
long-term PPA bids
