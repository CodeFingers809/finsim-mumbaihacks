  National,  21st  November  2025:  Ather  Energy  Limited,  India’s  leading  electric  two-wheeler  
manufacturer,
 
today
 
announced
 
the
 
launch
 
of
 
the
 
Rizta
 
in
 
Sri
 
Lanka
 
at
 
the
 
Colombo
 
Motor
 
Show
 
2025.
 
The
 
launch,
 
in
 
partnership
 
with
 
Evolution
 
Auto
 
Pvt.
 
Ltd,
 
Ather’s
 
authorized
 
distributor
 
in
 
Sri
 
Lanka,
 
marks
 
the
 
next
 
step
 
in
 
Ather’s
 
international
 
growth
 
strategy,
 
focused
 
on
 
expanding
 
its
 
product
 
portfolio
 
and
 
strengthening
 
its
 
ecosystem
 
in
 
key
 
international
 
markets.
  Ather  entered  Sri  Lanka  in  December  2024  with  the  Ather  450X and  has  since  established  a  growing  
footprint
 
with
 
40
 
Experience
 
Centers,
 
as
 
on
 
date,
 
operated
 
by
 
Evolution
 
Auto
 
Pvt.
 
Ltd.
 
Moreover,
 
with
 
an
 
aim
 
to
 
establish
 
the
 
ecosystem
 
around
 
EVs,
 
Ather
 
has
 
also
 
installed
 
Ather
 
Grid
 
fast
 
chargers,
 
to
 
support
 
convenient
 
and
 
reliable
 
EV
 
ownership
 
in
 
the
 
country.
  Speaking  on  the  launch,  Mr.  Ravneet  Singh  Phokela,  Chief  Business  Oﬃcer,  Ather  Energy  Limited ,  
said,
 
“Since
 
entering
 
Sri
 
Lanka
 
last
 
year,
 
it
 
has
 
quickly
 
become
 
a
 
growing
 
market
 
for
 
us,
 
and
 
expanding
 
our
 
portfolio
 
here
 
with
 
the
 
Rizta
 
felt
 
like
 
the
 
natural
 
next
 
step.
 
The
 
Rizta
 
has
 
seen
 
strong
 
acceptance
 
in
 
India
 
for
 
over
 
a
 
year
 
and
 
more
 
recently
 
in
 
Nepal,
 
and
 
we
 
believe
 
it
 
is
 
well-suited
 
for
 
the
 
needs
 
of
 
Sri
 
Lankan
 
riders
 
as
 
well.
 
Its
 
focus
 
on
 
safety
 
and
 
connected
 
capabilities
 
makes
 
it
 
a
 
practical
 
choice
 
for
 
everyday
 
use.
 
With
 
this
 
launch,
 
we
 
aim
 
to
 
deepen
 
our
 
presence
 
in
 
Sri
 
Lanka
 
and
 
continue
 
strengthening
 
the
 
EV
 
ecosystem
 
there."
  Backed  by  the  positive  response  to  the  Ather  450  line  up  in  Sri  Lanka,  Ather  has  now  introduced  the  
Rizta
 
in
 
the
 
picturesque
 
country.
 
The
 
Rizta
 
has
 
a
 
large
 
and
 
comfortable
 
seat
 
and
 
oﬀers
 
a
 
34L
 
under-seat
 
storage
 
capacity.
 
It
 
also
 
has
 
a
 
ﬂoorboard
 
that
 
provides
 
the
 
rider
 
with
 
ample
 
leg
 
space.
 
Additionally,
 
the
 
Rizta
 
comes
 
with
 
features
 
like
 
SkidControl™,
 
which
 
are
 
aimed
 
at
 
enhancing
 
the
 
safety
 
of
 
the
 
rider.

and
 
music
 
and
 
call
 
control
 
(available
