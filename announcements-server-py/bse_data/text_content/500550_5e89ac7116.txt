Review Report 
To 
The Board of Directors 
Siemens Limited, 
Birla Aurora, Level 21, Plot No. 1080, 
Dr. Annie Besant Road, Worlt 
Mumbai- 400030 
1. We have reviewed the standalone unaudited financial results of Siemens Limited (the 
"Company") for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 and the year to date results for the 
period October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025, which are included in the accompanying 
'Statement of standalone unaudited financial results for the quarter and twelve months 
ended 30 September 2025', the Statement of standalone assets and liabilities as on that 
date and the Statement of standalone cash flows for the twelve months ended on that date 
together with notes thereon (the "Statement"). The Statement has been prepared by the 
Company pursuant to Regulation 33 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (the "Listing 
Regulations, 2015"), which has been initialled by us for identification purposes. 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and approved 
by the Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial 
Reporting" ("Ind AS 34"), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and 
other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to express a 
conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India. This Standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate 
assurance as to whether the Statement is free of material misstatement. A review of interim 
financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for 
financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A 
review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards 
on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would 
become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, 
we do not express an audit opinion . 
4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us 
to believe that the Statement has not been prepared in all material respects in accordance 
with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian 
Accounting Standard and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and has 
not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the 
Listing Regulations, 2015 including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it 
contains any material misstatement.

5. We draw attention to -
a. Note 1 to the Statement in respect of the Scheme of Arrangement (the 'Scheme') 
between the Company, Siemens Energy India Limited and their respective shareholders 
and creditors for demerger of the Energy business of the Company (disclosed as 
discontinued operations in the accompanying Statement), which has been approved by 
the National Company Law Tribunal (the "NCLT") vide its order dated March 25, 2025. 
The Company has given effect of the Scheme from the 'appointed date' of March 1, 
2025, as approved by the NCLT, while the applicable accounting standards require 
accounting for the Scheme in the books of the Company to be carried out as a 
distribution of non-cash assets to owners when the distribution is appropriately 
authorised and is no longer at the discretion of the Company, which is the date of the 
final order passed by the NCLT sanctioning the Scheme as aforesaid (i.e., the 'effective 
date' per the Scheme). 
b. Note 2 to the Statement regarding the change of financial year of the Company, as 
approved by the Board of Directors. As a transitional arrangement, the Company will 
prepare the current year financial statements for a period of 18 months from October 1, 
2024 to March 31, 2026, which would comprise six quarters. Accordingly, the period 
July 1, 2025 to September 30, 2025 has been considered as the fourth quarter of the 
financial year ending March 31, 2026. The Company is in the process of taking the 
necessary steps and approvals to comply with procedural requirements emanating on 
account of change in the financial year. 
Our conclusion is not modified in respect of the above matters.

On 25 March 2025, the Scheme was sanctioned by the Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal (the "NCL T"). Pursuant to receipt of necessary statutory approvals 
and in accordance with the Scheme, the Company has demerged the Energy business effective 25 March 2025, with appointed date being 1 March 2025, as per 
the Scheme. 
Upon the Scheme being effective, the Company has transferred the assets and liabilities pertaining to Energy business to SEIL as on the appointed date. The 
Company has accordingly de recognized from its books of account the carrying amount of such assets and liabilities. The excess of the carrying amount of assets 
transferred over the carrying amount of liabilities transferred aggregating Rs. 37,846 million (including Rs. 25,478 million of cash and cash equivalents being 
transferred as an integral part of the Scheme) had been adjusted to retained earnings in accordance with the Scheme in the standalone unaudited financial results. 
Additionally, in accordance with the Scheme, the Company had also made certain consequential adjustments to applicable reserves within equity. 
Further, pursuant to the requirements of the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS), the results of the Company's Energy business up to the appointed date of 
demerger have been disclosed as discontinued operations; accordingly, the previous period figures have been re-presented. 
The results of the Company's Energy business included in the above standalone unaudited financial results and segment results are as follows:

• Considering the impact of the Scheme, the above numbers are up to 1 March 2025. 
2 The Board of Directors at its meeting held on 8 August 2025 has approved the change of financial year of the Company to uniform financial year commencing on 
1 April of every year and ending on 31 March of the following year including observing a one-time transitional financial year from 1 October 2024 to 31 March 2026. 
The Company is in the process of taking necessary steps and approvals to comply with procedural requirements emanating on account of change in financial year. 
Consequently, as a transitional arrangement , the current financial year of the Company will be for a period of 18 months from 1 October 2024 to 31 March 2026 
which would comprise six quarters, while the previous financial year was for a period of 12 months from 1 October 2023 to 30 September 2024. In view of the 
above, the Company considered the period from 1 July 2025 to 30 September 2025 as a standalone fourth.quarter of the financial year ending 31 March 2026. The 
audited results for the previous financial year ended 30 September 2024 and the unaudited results for the twelve months ended 30 September 2025 are for 12 
months period and therefore comparable .

4 During the current period, the Company has benchmarked and re-evaluated the presentation and classification of the below-mentioned financial statement line 
items in the standalone financial results. The Company has determined that such a change results in an enhanced and more relevant presentation and 
classification of its financial information, taking into account the nature of its current business operations as per paragraph 45 of Ind AS 1 - Presentation of Financial 
Statements. This change in presentation and classification did not have an impact on the overall financial results. Accordingly, the figures for the prior period have 
been reclassified and re-presented to conform to the current period's classification as summarised below: 
(Rs. in million)

Siemens Limited,

Dr. Annie Besant Road, Worli, 
Mumbai - 400030 
1. We have reviewed the consolidated unaudited financial results of Siemens Limited (the 
"Holding Company") and its subsidiaries (the holding company and its subsidiaries 
hereinafter referred to as the "Group") (refer paragraph 4 below) for the quarter ended 
September 30, 2025 and the year to date results for the period October 1, 2024 to September 
30, 2025, which are included in the accompanying 'Statement of consolidated unaudited 
financial results for the qua1ter and twelve months ended 30 September 2025', the 
Statement of consolidated assets and liabilities as on that date and the Statement of 
consolidated cash flows for the twelve months ended on that date together with notes 
thereon (the "Statement") . The Statement is being submitted by the Holding Company 
pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (the 
"Listing Regulations, 2015 "), which has been initialled by us for identification purposes. 
2 . This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Holding Company's Management and 
approved by the Holding Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance 
with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 
34 "Interim Financial Reporting" ("Ind AS 34"), prescribed under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India . Our 
responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants oflndia. 
This Standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance 
as to whether the Statem ent is free of material misstatem ent. A review of interim financial 
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and 
accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on 
Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become 
aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion. 
We also performed procedures in accordance with the circular issued by the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India under Regulation 33(8) of the Listing Regulations, 2015, to the 
extent applicable. 
4. The Statement includes the results of Holding Company and the following entities:

5. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above, 
nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement 
has not been prepared in all material respects in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standard and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India and has not disclosed the information 
required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations, 2015 including 
the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement . 
6. We draw attention to -
a. Note 1 to the Statement in respect of the Scheme of Arrangement (the 'Scheme') between 
the Holding Company, Siemens Energy India Limited and their respective shareholders 
and creditors for demerger of the Energy business of the Holding Company (disclosed 
as discontinued operations in the accompanying Statement), which has been approved 
by the National Company Law Tribunal (the "NCLT") vide its order dated March 25, 
2025. The Holding Company has given effect of the Scheme from the 'appointed date' of 
March 1, 2025, as approved by the NCLT, while the applicable accounting standards 
require accounting for the Scheme in the books of the Holding Company to be carried 
out as a distribution of non-cash assets to owners when the distribution is appropriately 
authorised and is no longer at the discretion of the Holding Company, which is the date 
of the final order passed by the NCLT sanctioning the Scheme as aforesaid (i.e., the 
'effective date' per the Scheme). 
b. Note 2 to the Statement regarding the change of financial year of the Holding Company, 
as approved by the Board of Directors. As a transitional arrangement, the Holding 
Company will prepare the current year financial statements for a period of 18 months 
from October 1, 2024 to March 31, 2026, which would comprise six quarters. 
Accordingly, the period July 1, 2025 to September 30, 2025 has been considered as the 
fomth quarter of the financial year ending March 31, 2026. The Holding Company is in 
the process of taking the necessary steps and approvals to comply with procedural 
requirements emanating on account of change in the financial year. 
Our conclusion is not modified in respect of the above matters .

Notes: 
During the previous year, the Board of Directors of the Holding Company, at its meeting held on 14 May 2024, basis the recommendations of the Audit Committee and Committee 
of Independent Directors, approved a scheme of arrangement amongst the Holding Company, Siemens Energy India Limited ("SEIL") (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Holding 
Company, which was incorporated on 7 February 2024) and their respective shareholders and creditors, providing for the demerger of the Group's Energy business to SEIL in 
compliance with Sections 230 to 232 and other applicable provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (the "Scheme"). 
On 25 March 2025, the Scheme was sanctioned by the Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal (the "NCL T"). Pursuant to receipt of necessary statutory approvals and in 
accordance with the Scheme, the Holding Company has demerged the Energy business effective 25 March 2025, with appointed date being 1 March 2025, as per the Scheme. 
Upon the Scheme being effective, the Holding Company has transferred the assets and liabilities pertaining to Energy business to SEIL as on the appointed date. The Holding 
Company has accordingly derecognized from its books of account the carrying amount of such assets and liabilities. The excess of the carrying amount of assets transferred over 
the carrying amount of liabilities transferred aggregating Rs. 37,846 million (including Rs. 25,478 million of cash and cash equivalents being transferred as an integral part of the 
Scheme) had been adjusted to retained earnings in accordance with the Scheme in the consolidated unaudited financial results. Additionally, in accordance with the Scheme, the 
Holding Company had also made certain consequential adjustments to applicable reserves within equity. 
Further, pursuant to the requirements of the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS), the results of the Group's Energy business up to the appointed date of demerger have been 
disclosed as discontinued operations; accordingly, the previous period figures have been re-presented.

2 The Board of Directors at its meeting held on 8 August 2025 has approved the change of financial year of the Holding Company to uniform financial year commencing on 1 April of 
every year and ending on 31 March of the following year including observing a one-time transitional financial year from 1 October 2024, to March 31, 2026. The Holding Company 
is in the process of taking necessary steps and approvals to comply with procedural requirements emanating on account of change in financial year. 
Consequently, as a transitional arrangement, the current financial year of the Group will be for a period of 18 months from 1 October 2024 to 31 March 2026 which would comprise 
six quarters, while the previous financial year was for a period of 12 months from 1 October 2023 to 30 September 2024. In view of the above, the Group considered the period 
from 1 July 2025 to 30 September 2025 as a standalone fourth quarter of the financial year ending 31 March 2026. The audited results for the previous financial year ended 30 
September 2024 and the unaudited results for the twelve months ended 30 September 2025 are for 12 months period and therefore comparable.

Sunil Mathur, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Siemens Limited, said, “ Siemens 
Limited delivered a robust performance this quarter, with a 16% surge in Revenue, driven by strong 
performance in our Mobility and Smart Infrastructure businesses while Digital Industries volumes 
were impacted due to a lower reach in the order backlog from the previous year  and muted private 
sector Capex. The Profit was impacted by one-time gain of INR 69 crore from the sale of property in 
Q4 FY 2024. While Government spending in Capex in Infrastructure continues, with recent measures 

 
to boost consumption through easing of Income Tax rates and GST reforms, we have seen an uptick 
in consumption during the festive period. We remain cautiously optimistic that this trend will continue 
in future quarters ultimately leading to a pickup in private sector Capex.”   
 
On August 8, 2025, the Board of Directors of the Company had approved the change in financial year 
of the Company  from October-September to April -March. The current financial year is changed to 
October 1, 2024 – March 31, 2026 (18 months) and, thereafter, the financial year of the Company 
shall be from April 1 to March 31, every year.
