Limited Review Report on Standalone Financial Results 
We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited standalone financial results of CIAN Agro 
Industries & Infrastructure Limited for the Quarter ended 30" September, 2025 (“the Statement”). This 
statement is the responsibility of the Company’s Management and has been approved by the Board of 
Directors. Our responsibility is to issue a report on these financial statements based on our review. 
We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements 
(SRE) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity”, 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform 
the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures 
applied to financial data and thus, provides less assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit 
and accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe 
that the accompanying statements of unaudited financial results prepared in accordance with applicable 
accounting standards and other recognized accounting practices and policies has not disclosed the 
information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 52 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it 
contains any material misstatement.

Limited Review Report on Consolidated Financial Results 
We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Unaudited Financial Results of CIAN Agro 
Industries & Infrastructure Limited (“the Parent”) and its subsidiaries (the Parent and its subsidiaries 
together referred to as “the Group”), for the Quarter ended 30th September, 2025 (“the Statement”), 
being submitted by the Parent pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015. 
This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Parent’s Management and approved by the Parent’s 
Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles 
laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” (“Ind AS 34”), prescribed under 
Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our 
responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements 
(SRE) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity”, 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists 
of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying 
analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in 
accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we 
would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion. We also performed procedures in accordance with the circular issued by the
