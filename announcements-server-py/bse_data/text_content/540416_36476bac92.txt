RISK FACTORS    
 
RISKS RELATED TO THE TRANSACTION, THE PROPOSED OPEN OFFER AND THE PROBABLE RISKS 
INVOLVED IN ASSOCIATING WITH THE ACQUIRER  
 
(A) Risk relating to the transaction. 
 
The Open Offer is subject to compliance with terms and conditions a s set out under the Share Purchase 
Agreement dated Tuesday, August 12, 2025. As on the date of this Letter of Offer, there are no apparent conditions 
mentioned in the SPA (as defined below) which  may warrant a withdrawal of the Offer under Regulation 23(1)  of 
the SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011. If later, any other statutory or regulatory approvals or no objection are 
required, the Offer would become subject to receipt of such other statutory  or regulatory or other approvals or no 
objections. 
 
 
3 
 
(B) Risk relating to the Offer 
 
1. In the event that (a) any statutory approvals being required by the Acquirer at a later date, this Offer shall be subject 
to such approvals and the Acquirer shall make the necessary applications for such approvals and in case of delay in 
receipt of any such statutory approvals; (b) there is any litigation leading to a stay on the Open Offer. In case of delay, 
due to non -receipt of statutory approval(s) in accordance with Regulation 18(11) of the SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 
2011, SEBI may, if satisfied that the non-receipt of approvals was not due to any wilful default or negligence on the 
part of the Acquirer, grant extension for the purpose of completion of this Open Offer subject to Acquirer agreeing to 
pay interest to the Public Shareholders, as may be specified by SEBI. 
2. The Acquirer will not proceed with the Open Offer in the event of statutory approvals, if any required, are refused in 
terms of Regulation 23(1)(a) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011. 
3. The tendered Equity Shares in physical form with the related documents submitted therewith would be held in trust by 
the Registrar to the Offer and in credit of the Depositories account until the process of acceptance of Equity Shares 
tendered and payment of consideration to the respective Public Shareholders is completed. 
4. Equity Shares tendered in the Open Offer cannot be withdrawn during the tendering period, even in the event of delay 
in acceptance or dispatch of consideration. Upon tendering, a lien will be marked on such Equity Shares and they will 
remain blocked in the shareholder’s demat account (or in the custody of the Registrar to the Offer and/or Clearing 
Corporation, as applicable). Consequently, the Public Shareholders will not be able to trade such Equity Shares 
during the tendering period and until the completion of all formalities of the Offer, thereby exposing them to market 
risk and volatility. 
5. All Public Shareholders, including non -residents holders of Equity Shares, must obtain all requisite approvals 
required, if any, to tender Equit y Shares (including without limitation, the approval from the RBI) and submit such 
approvals, along with the other documents required to accept this Offer. In the event such approvals are not 
submitted, the Acquirer reserves the right to reject such Equity Shares tendered in this Offer. Further, if the holders of 
the Equity Shares who are not persons resident in India (including non-resident Indians, foreign institutional investors 
and foreign portfolio investors) had required any approvals (including from the RBI, or any other regulatory body) in 
respect of the Equity Shares held by them, they will be required to submit such previous approvals, that they would 
have obtained for holding the Equity Shares, to tender Equity Shares, along with the other documents required to be 
tendered to accept this Offer. In the event such approvals are not submitted, the Acquirer reserves the right to reject 
such Equity Shares. Public Shareholders classified as overseas corporate bodies (“OCB”), if any, may tender the 
Equity Shares held by them in the Open Offer pursuant to receipt of approval from the RBI under the Foreign 
Exchange Management Act, 1999 and the rules and regulations made thereunder. Such OCBs shall approach the 
RBI independently to seek approval to tender the Equity Shares held by them in the Open Offer. 
6. The Public Shareholders are advised to consult their respective stockbroker, legal, financial, investment or other 
advisors and consultants of their choosing, if any, for assessing further risks with respect to their participation in this 
Open Offer, and related transfer of Equity Shares of the Target Company to the Acquirer. Public Shareholders are 
advised to consult their respective tax advisors for assessing the tax liability pursuant to this Offer, or in re spect of 
other aspects such as the treatment that may be given by their respective assessing officers in their case and the 
appropriate course of action that they should take. The Acquirer and the Manager to the Offer do not accept any 
responsibility for the accuracy or otherwise of the tax provisions set forth in this Letter of Offer. 
7. The information pertaining to the Target Company contained in this Letter of Offer, including financial information, 
shareholding patterns, and other data, has been obtained from publicly available sources (such as filings with stock 
exchanges, annual reports, and information published by the Target Company) and/or from the Target Company. 
Neither the Acquirer nor the Manager to the Offer has independently verified such inform ation. Accordingly, no 
assurance can be given regarding the accuracy, completeness, or adequacy of such information, and shareholders 
are advised to exercise caution in placing reliance on the same.  
8. The Acquirer shall have the right to withdraw the Open Offer in circumstances specified under Regulation 23(1) of the 
SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011, subject to SEBI’s approval, if applicable. In the event of such withdrawal, a Public 
Announcement of withdrawal will be made within two (2) working days of such decision, and the same will be notified 
to SEBI, Stock Exchange, and the Target Company, in accordance with the SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011. 
9. In the event of a delay in making payment of consideration to Public Shareholders who have validly tendered their 
Equity Shares in the Open Offer, the Acquirer may be required, under Regulation 18(11) of the SEBI (SAST) 
Regulations, 2011, to pay interest at the rate of 10% per annum (or such other rate as may be directed by SEBI) for 
4 
 
the period of delay, provided such delay is attributable to any act or omission of the Acquirer. SEBI, however, has the 
discretion to grant a waiver from payment of interest if the delay is not attributable to the Acquirer. Further, under 
Regulation 17(9) of the SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011, in the event of non-fulfilment of obligations under the Open 
Offer, the escrow account created in terms of the Regulations may be forfeited, in whole or in part, by SEBI and 
distributed to the eligible shareholders or otherwise dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Regulations. 
10. This Open Offer is being made in compliance with the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) 
Regulations, 2011, and is directed solely to the Public Shareholders of the Target Company holding Equity Shares in 
accordance with applicable Indian laws. The Offer is not directed to and may not be accepted by or on behalf of, any 
person or entity in any jurisdiction where making or accepting such an offer or solicitation would be unlawful, contrary 
to applicable laws or regulations, or would require any registration, approval, or compliance under the laws of such 
jurisdiction.  
The Letter of Offer, and all accompanying documents have been prepared in accordance with Indian regulatory, 
procedural, and accounting requirements, which differ in certain material respects from the disclosure and accounting 
standards generally applicable in the United States (including U.S. GAAP) and other jurisdictions. Public 
Shareholders resident in the United States or other jurisdictions should note that the tendering of Equity Shares held 
by them will be subject to the restrictions and procedures as required under applicable laws. 
11. Post completion of this Open Offer, the public shareholding in the Target Company may fall below the  minimum 
level of 25% required for continuous listing under Rule 19A of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 
(“SCRR”) read with Regulation 38 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015 (“SEBI LODR Regulatio ns”). In such a case, in terms of Regulation 7(4) of the SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 
2011, the Acquirer shall be responsible for ensuring that the minimum public shareholding is restored within the 
prescribed timelines, through any of the methods permitted by  SEBI (such as offer for sale, qualified institutions 
placement, further public offer, or any other SEBI -approved mechanism). Until such compliance is achieved, 
trading in the Equity Shares of the Target Company may be adversely affected, and any delay in restoring MPS 
may attract regulatory action under applicable law. 
12. Shareholders should note that neither the Acquirer nor the Manager to the Offer provides any assurance regarding 
the past or future financial performance of the Target Company, its business prospects, or the decisions relating to its 
operations. Further, no assurance is being provided regarding the impact of the acquisition on the employees, their 
continued employment, or the business strategies that may be adopted by the Acquirer in the futu re, including any 
investment or divestment decisions. Such matters will be determined solely at the discretion of the Board of Directors 
of the Target Company and/or the Acquirer, subject to applicable laws, and may materially affect the future 
performance of the Target Company. 
13. Neither the Acquirer, the Manager to the Offer, nor the Registrar to the Offer shall be responsible for any loss, delay, 
misplacement, or mishandling of documents (including but not limited to the Form of Acceptance -cum-
Acknowledgement, share transfer forms, delivery instruction slips, or share certificates) during transit. Public 
Shareholders are advised to take adequate precautions to safeguard their interests, such as sending documents 
through registered post, courier, or other trackable means, and retaining proof of dispatch/acknowledgement. 
14. In the event of oversubscription of the Open Offer, acceptance of Equity Shares will be made on a proportionate basis 
in accordance with Regulation 21 of the SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that 
all the Equity Shares tendered by the Public Shareholders will be accepted in the Offer. Equity Shares not accepted, if 
any, will be returned to the respective shareholders within the timelines prescribed under the SEBI (SAST) 
Regulations, 2011 and other applicable laws. 
(C) Probable risk involved in associating with the Acquirer.  
 
1. The Acquirer makes no assurance with respect to the financial performance of the Target Company and disclaim s 
any responsibility with respect to any decision taken by the Shareholders on whether or not to participate in the Offer.

5 
 
3. The Acquirer do not accept any responsibility for statements made otherwise than in the  Letter of Offer (LOF)/Draft 
Letter of Offer (DLOF)/Detailed Public Statement (DPS)/Public Announcement (PA) and anyone placing reliance on 
any other sources of information (not released by the acquirer) would be doing so at his/her/its own risk. 
4. The acquirer does not accept the responsibility with respect to the information contained in the PA or DPS or DLOF or 
LOF that pertains to the Target Company and has been obtained from publicly available resources or from the Target 
Company.  
The risk factors set forth above, pertaining to the Offer and are not in relation to the present or future business or 
operations of the Target Company or any other related matters, and are neither exhaustive nor intended to 
constitute a complete analysis of the risks involved in participation or otherwise by a shareholder in the Offer.

any gain realized on the sale of listed equity shares held for a period of 12 months or less which are sold, will be 
subject to short term capital gains tax @20% provided the transaction is chargeable to STT. 
 
8.7.3 The above tax rates are subject to applicable rate of surcharge, health and education cess or any other as may
