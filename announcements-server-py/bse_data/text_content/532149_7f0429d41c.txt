*Instrument details are provided in Annexure I 
Rationale 
The rating continues to factor in  Bank of India’s (BoI)  strong capital position  as well as the continuous improvement in its 
solvency1 level on the back of the declining net stressed assets  level. It also considers the sovereign ownership and the 
demonstrated track record of capital support from the Government of India (GoI), which is expected to be forthcoming if 
required. The impact of the proposed transitioning to loan loss provisioning, based on the expected credit loss (ECL) 
framework, on BoI’s capital and profitability levels is also likely to be manageable due to  the improved capital buffers. 
Moreover, the rating takes into account  the bank’s strong resource profile , given its well-developed retail franchise, which 
translates into a granular deposit base and a competitive cost of funds.  
The bank’s overall potential stress book, comprising the overdue and restructured book, has declined gradually from the higher 
level during the Covid-19 pandemic. Additionally, the improved operating profitability provides cushion to the capital  against 
unforeseen asset quality shocks . Further, barring a marginal decline in its annualised return on assets (RoA) to 0.91% in H1 
FY2026, BoI’s profitability has been improving steadily and was reported at 0.95% in FY2025  compared to 0.74% in FY2024. 
Nevertheless, it remained below the public sector banks’ (PSBs) average of 1.12% in H1 FY2026 (1.12% in FY2025) because of 
the lower net interest margin (NIM) . BoI’s ability to keep slippages  and credit costs  at lower levels  and reduce its cost -to-
income ratio will be important to ensure healthy profitability.  Moreover, a material weakening in global macroeconomic 
conditions will be monitorable as it could potentially impact the asset quality and profitability levels. 
BoI has confirmed that there are no deposits outstanding , which were mobilised using ICRA’s ratings. Hence, at the bank’s 
request and in accordance with ICRA’s withdrawal policy, the rating for the fixed deposit has been withdrawn , which was 
previously placed on notice of withdrawal. 
Key rating drivers and their description 
Credit strengths 
Sovereign ownership with demonstrated capital support from GoI  – The rating continues to factor in the bank’s majority 
sovereign ownership (73.38% as on September 30, 2025) and the demonstrated track record of capital infusions by the GoI of 
~Rs. 29,784 crore during FY2017-FY2021. This supported a meaningful reduction in the net non-performing advances (NNPAs) 
over the last few years and BoI’s exit from the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 
FY2019. Given the steady improvement in internal capital generation and the equity raise in FY2022 and FY2024, BoI is not 
expected to require further capital in the near term , though ICRA expects the same to be forthcoming if required . Moreover, 
the rating will be reassessed in case of a change in the sovereign ownership.  
 
1 Solvency is defined as (NNPAs + Net security receipts + Net non-performing investments)/Core capital)

 Page | 2 Sensitivity Label : Public 
Strong capitalisation levels – The bank’s core equity capital (CET  I) and Tier I capital stood at 13.89% and 14.49% (excluding 
H1 FY2026 profit), respectively, as on September 30, 2025 (14.84% and 15.47%, respectively, as on March 31, 2025). While the 
capitalisation profile was supported by infusions in the past, BoI has remained profitable since FY2021, supporting its capital 
ratios despite the growth in assets. The capital position was also aided by the equity raise of Rs. 2,550 crore and Rs. 4,500 crore 
via qualified institutional placement s (QIPs) in FY2022 and FY2024, respectively. Better capitalisation levels, along with the 
decline in the net stressed assets level, supported the gradual improvement in the solvency level to 6.84% as on September 
30, 2025 (8.10% as on March 31, 2025 and 11.67% as on March 31, 2024). With the improved capital and profitability position, 
the impact of the proposed transitioning to ECL based on loan loss provisioning is also expected to be manageable. 
ICRA notes that the bank may be required to support its subsidiaries and/or regional rural bank via capital infusion s. 
Nevertheless, this is anticipated to stay at a manageable level. ICRA expects BoI to remain sufficiently capitalised as its internal 
capital generation is likely to provide the requisite growth capital.  
Well-developed deposit franchise, leading to competitive cost of funds  – BoI continues to derive strength from its granular 
deposit base, which is supported by its network of 5,399 branches as on September 30, 2025 (5,213 as on September 30, 2024), 
with a deep presence in rural and semi-urban areas (65% of total branches). Its liability profile has traditionally been dominated 
by deposits, driven by the low -cost domestic current account savings account (CASA) deposits, which stood above the PSB 
average at 39.24% of total domestic deposits as on September 30, 2025. The cost of funds of 5.18% in H1 FY2026 was slightly 
above the PSB average of 5.11%. As on September 30, 2025, domestic deposits rose by 8.53% year-on-year (YoY), which was 
slightly below the PSB average of 9.43%. However, this growth was lower than the 14.73% YoY increase in domestic advances. 
The deposit base remains granular, with the share of the top 20 depositors at 6.19% as on March 31, 2025 (5.97% as on March 
31, 2024, and 7.67% as on March 31, 2023).  
Credit challenges 
Asset quality remains monitorable  – The gross annualised fresh NPA generation rate moderated to 0.94% of standard 
advances in H1 FY2026 from 1.36% in FY2025 (1.58% in FY2024). Further, BoI’s headline asset quality metrics have improved 
steadily, supported by high recoveries, upgrades, and write-offs. As a result, the gross NPA (GNPA) and NNPA declined to 2.54% 
and 0.65%, respectively, as on September 30, 2025 (3.27% and 0.82%, respectively, as on March 31, 202 5; 4.98% and 1.22%, 
respectively, as on March 31 , 2024). Despite the improvement in the headline asset quality metrics , the overall vulnerable 
book (special mention account 2 (SMA-1 + SMA-2) + standard restructured  book) continues to be high in relation to the core 
capital. BoI’s ability to limit slippages from this book will remain a near -to-medium-term monitorable. Moreover, a material 
weakening in macroeconomic conditions will be monitorable as it could potentially impact the asset quality and profitability 
levels.  
Profitability improves but remains below peers  – The bank’s profitability has been improving over the years, barring a 
marginal decline in H1 FY2026 due to compressed NIMs because of rate cuts, as seen by the industry. It reported RoA of 0.91% 
(annualised) in H1 FY2026 and 0.95% in FY2025 compared to 0.74% in FY2024. Nevertheless, it remains below the peer PSB 
average RoA, which rose to 1.12% in FY2025 from 0.98% in FY2024. BoI’s relatively lower profitability vis-à-vis the PSB average 
was primarily due to lower yields, subdued non-interest income and the higher operating cost ratio . The bank expects the 
repricing of the remaining deposits in the coming quarters and expects to achieve an RoA of 1% by the exit quarter of FY2026.  
  
 
2 SMA is defined as a special mention account (SMA), which is an account exhibiting signs of incipient stress resulting in the borrower 
defaulting in the timely servicing of their debt obligations though the account has not yet been classified as an NPA as p er the extant RBI 
guidelines; SMA-1 accounts are overdue by 31-60 days while SMA-2 accounts are overdue by 61-90 days

Environmental and social risks 
While banks like BoI do not face material physical climate risks, they are exposed to environmental risks indirectly through 
their portfolio of assets. If the entities or businesses, to which banks and financial institutions have an exposure, face business 
disruptions because of physical climate adversities or if such businesses face climate transition risks because of technological, 
regulatory or customer behaviour changes, it could translate into credit risks for banks. However, such risk is not material for 
BoI as it benefits from adequate portfolio diversification. Further, the lending is typically short -to-medium term, allowing it to 
adapt and take incremental exposure to businesses that face relatively fewer downside environmental risks.  
With regard to social risks, data security and customer privacy are among the key sources of vulnerability for banks as material 
lapses could be detrimental to their reputation and invite regulatory censure. BoI has not faced material lapses over the years. 
Customer preferences are increasingly shifting towards digital banking, which provides an opportunity to reduce the operating 
costs. BoI has been making the requisite investments to enhance its digital interface with its customers. While it contributes 
to promoting financial inclusion by lending to the underserved segments, its lending practices remain prudent as reflected in 
the steady improvement in its asset quality numbers. 
Liquidity position: Strong 
BoI’s reported liquidity coverage ratio of 119.76% and net stable funding ratio of 113.88% in Q2 FY2026 were well above the 
regulatory requirement of 100%. ICRA expects the bank to maintain its strong liquidity profile, given the large proportion of  
retail deposits and the high portfolio of liquid investments. It can also avail liquidity support from the RBI (through reverse 
repo against excess statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) investments and marginal standing facility mechanism) in case of urgent 
liquidity requirements.  
Rating sensitivities 
Positive factors – BoI’s ability to increase its scale of operations meaningfully, while improving its profitability and maintaining 
a comfortable solvency profile and healthy capitalisation profile, will be a positive factor. 
Negative factors – The rating will be reassessed in case of a change in the sovereign ownership. ICRA could also downgrade 
the rating if the asset quality or capitalisation profile deteriorates, thereby weakening the solvency profile. Further, RoA of less 
than 0.5% on a sustained basis will be a negative trigger.  
Analytical approach 
Analytical approach Comments 
Applicable rating methodologies ICRA’s Rating Methodology for Banks and Financial Institutions 
Policy on Withdrawal of Credit Ratings 
Parent/Group support The rating factors in BoI’s sovereign ownership and the demonstrated track record of capital 
infusions by the GoI. 
Consolidation/Standalone 
For arriving at the rating, ICRA has considered the standalone financials of BoI. However, in 
line with ICRA’s consolidation approach, the standalone assessment of the bank factors in the 
ordinary and extraordinary support that it is expected to extend to its subsidiary.

Key features of rated debt instruments  
The servicing of the Basel III Tier II bonds is not subject to any capital ratios and profitability. However, the Basel III Tier II bonds 
and Basel III Tier I bonds (AT -I bonds) are expected to absorb losses once the point of non -viability (PONV) trigger is invoked 
by the RBI. These Basel III bonds have equity -like loss-absorption features, which may translate into higher loss severity vis -à 
vis conventional debt instruments.
