Independent Auditor’s Review Report on Standalone Unaudited Quarterly and Year to

(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) 
 
Review Report to, 
The Board of Directors of  
Brahmaputra Infrastructure Limited, 
 
1. We were engaged to review the accompanying statement of standalone unaudited financial 
results of Brahmaputra Infrastructure Limited (‘the Company’) for the quarter and year to date 
ended September 30, 2025 ('the Statement') attached herewith, being submitted by the Company 
pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 and of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 as amended. 
 
2. The Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and approved by the 
Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement Principles laid down in Indian accounting standard 34, Interim Fin ancial 
Reporting ('Ind AS 34, prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act. 2013 (“the Act'), 
and other accounting Principles generally accepted in India and is in compliance with the' 
presentation and disclosure requirement  of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations. 2015 (as amended), including relevant circulars issued 
by the SEBI from time to time. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement 
based on our review. 
 
3. We  conducted  our  review  of  the  Statement  in  accordance  with  the  Standard  on  Review 
Engagements  (SRE)  2410  “Review  of  Interim  Financial  Information  Performed  by  the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Charte red Accountants of India. 
This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to 
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. A review is limited primarily 
to inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus 
provide less assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do 
not express an audit opinion. 
 
4. We draw attention to note No. 9 to the accompanying Statement, regarding uncertainties 
relating to recoverability of  Retention/withheld by clients Receivables and arbitration and 
other claim receivables amounting to ₹ 8.25 Crore and Rs. 164.28 Crore respectively as at 30 
September 2025, which represent various claims raised in the earlier years in respect of 
projects substantially closed and where the claims a re currently under negotiation s / 
discussions / arbitration / litigation. Based on legal opinion / past experience with respect to 
such claims, management is of the view that the aforementioned majority of the balances are 
fully recoverable. 
 Our report is not modified on above matters. 
 
 
 
                                                                                                       GOYAL NAGPAL& CO  
                                                                                                              CHARTERED  ACCOUNTANTS

believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under section 133  of the Act, and 
other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information 
required to be disclosed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI
