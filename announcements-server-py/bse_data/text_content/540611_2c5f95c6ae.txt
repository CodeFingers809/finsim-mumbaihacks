WD - Rating Withdrawn
Analytical Approach
Ind-Ra continues to take a standalone view of AU SFB to arrive at the ratings.
Detailed Rationale of the Rating Action
The affirmation reflects the bank’s small but fast-growing franchise, with above-average profitability metrics and adequate
capital buffers, moderate liability franchise with progressing granularity, and increasing diversification in assets and
liabilities from its home state (Rajasthan).
 
Furthermore, the rating factors in AU SFB’s granular retail assets franchise, which has been generating higher yields
compared to its peers, offsetting the higher cost of funds. AU SFB has a long track record and strong experience in its core
segment of commercial retail assets, and it has been expanding its base in newer products. The asset quality performance
of unsecured products on a sustained basis with seasoning remains a rating monitorable,  given the higher risk profile of
this segment and its potential impact on the overall asset quality. Additionally, the bank’s transition to a Universal Bank
model and its ability to contain operating expenses while achieving liability-side benefits would be a rating monitorable.
 
Over the long term, AU SFB would benefit from its transition to a Universal Bank in terms of improved brand recognition
among depositors, which can help in further diversifying retail liabilities with pricing benefit, reduction in mandatory capital
adequacy and reduced priority sector lending requirement, which could aid growth. Progress on this front remains a rating
monitorable.
 
List of Key Rating Drivers
Strengths
Well-positioned retail asset franchise
Scaling secured products for market leadership
Healthy capital base with earnings resilience
Weaknesses
Asset quality under pressure
Moderate granular retail liabilities
Detailed Description of Key Rating Drivers
Well-Positioned Retail Asset Franchise: AU SFB is the largest SFB in India in terms of total assets. The bank had a
total asset base of INR1,655.4 billion at end-September 2025, with 2,626 touchpoints across 21 states and four union
territories, supported by a workforce of 57,786. The bank has a demonstrated track record of three decades of catering to
the unorganised customer segment, which has enabled it to maintain a balance between profitability and asset quality
across economic cycles. AU SFB has a well-defined strategic business unit structure, enabling a clear focus on product
segments, along with teams that possess local knowledge across operating geographies.
 
In addition to expanding its presence within its home state, AU SFB has been increasing its operations in other states. The
share of its home state’s gross loan portfolio has moderated over the past few years and stood at 26% in 2QFY26 (FY18:
54%). Furthermore, the bank has expanded its product lines while maintaining its growth trajectory in its core verticals of
wheels and small business loans.
 
Scaling Secured Products for Market Leadership: At end-2QFY26, the bank’s gross loan portfolio stood at INR1,228.8
billion (2QFY25: INR1,050.3 billion), comprising a retail secured portfolio (67.3%), commercial banking (20.7%),
unsecured (7.6%), and others (4.3%). AU SFB had been operating in the retail secured segments and commercial
segment even before turning into a bank. Ind-Ra expects the bank to continue to grow its loan book at above-industry
rates due to its smaller scale, and also, it is in better position to grow compared to non-banking financial companies due to
the cost of fund advantage.
 
The bank also has a competitive advantage in terms of reach and local knowledge in Rajasthan. In addition, it has a
reasonable presence in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, which, along with Rajasthan, accounted for 55% of the loan
portfolio in 2QFY26 (2QFY25: 54%; FY24: 62%). While this creates geographical concentration risk, the contribution of the
south region stood 10% at end-2QFY26; moreover, the bank has been focusing on expanding its franchise in newer
geographies such as Uttar Pradesh, East India and southern markets, as well as broadening its product offerings. 
 
Healthy Capital Base with Earnings Resilience: AU SFB has a demonstrated track record of equity capital raising.
During FY23, AU SFB raised INR20 billion of equity capital through the qualified institutional placement route and INR7.7
billion through Tier-II bonds. At end-2QFY26, the bank’s capital buffers remained adequate, with shareholder funds of
INR183.2 billion and capital adequacy ratio of 18.8% (Tier-I: 16.9%) (FY25: 20.1%; FY24: 20.1%).
 
AU SFB primarily focuses on the retail segment, which carries higher yields. The bank’s average cost of funds decreased
to 6.96% in 1HFY26 (1HFY25: 7.04%) on the back of the cut in deposit rates across the sector. The bank was able to
maintain a healthy net interest margin of 5.4% in 1HFY26 (1HFY25: 6.1%). 
 
AU SFB focuses on granular retail asset loans, which require high on-field effort and operating costs. On the liability side,
to build and sustain the liability franchise, the bank needs to spend upfront on operating investments to create brand
awareness. Consequently, the cost-to-income ratio of the bank remained elevated at 57.7% in 2QFY26 (FY25: 56.5%;
FY24: 65.1%).  AU SFB had a healthy pre-provision operating profit (PPOP) buffer (PPOP/provision cost) of 2.5x in
2QFY26 (FY25: 2.6x; FY24: 6.1x). Its return on asset was reasonably healthy at 1.5% in 2QFY26 (annualised) (FY25:
1.6%; FY24: 1.5%). AU SFB has adequate PPOP and capital adequacy buffers to absorb incremental asset quality
pressures in a stress case scenario.
 
Asset Quality under pressure: AU SFB lends to self-employed individuals who run small businesses, which are largely
earn-and-pay in nature. Hence, the cash flows of such borrowers remain vulnerable to external economic shocks. That
being said, at end-September 2025, 92% of the assets were secured in nature, based on the products. However, AU
SFB’s gross NPA ratio increased to 2.41% in 2QF26 (FY25: 2.28%; FY24: 1.67%) on account of asset quality weakness in
unsecured segments, such as credit cards, personal loans and microfinance, with provision coverage ratio (excluding
technical write-off) at 64.2%. The net NPA ratio stood at 0.88% in 2QFY26 (FY25: 0.74%; FY24: 0.55%). Consequent to
increased asset quality pressure, the credit cost (on gross advances) increased to 1.9% in FY25 from 0.7% in FY24. Ind-
Ra expects the credit cost trajectory to be downwards in MFI loans, with the SMA book declining to 2.9% in 2QFY26 (from
4.3% in 1QFY26) and 69% of the MFI portfolio  being covered under the Credit Guarantee Fund for Micro Units  program
at end-September 2025. The credit cost in credit cards loans has started to decline from 2QFY26. Ind-Ra will monitor
steady-state asset quality trends with adequate vintage in the unsecured segment.
 
The bank’s standard restructured portfolio accounted for 0.2% of the gross advances at end-September 2025. Also, AU
SFB has been carrying a floating provision of INR410 million from FY22 to further strengthen the balance sheet, acting as
a counter cyclical buffer, to be utilised with the prior approval of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
Moderate Granular Retail Liabilities: AUSFB’s deposit base grew at a CAGR of 29.6% during FY23-1HFY26 to reach
INR1,325.1 billion. However, the current account savings account (CASA) ratio remained at a moderate level of 29.4% in
1HFY26 (FY25: 29.2%; FY24: 33.4%; FY23: 38.4%), driven by the overall industry trend of a shift in CASA towards term
deposits due to the attractiveness of high rates offered to the depositors. The share of retail term deposits in the total
deposits continued to be healthy at 31.9% in 1HFY26 (FY25: 32.5%; FY24: 30%; FY23: 30%; FY22: 30%). The granular
retail liabilities (CASA+ retail term deposit) to total deposit ratio remained largely stable at 61.3% in 1HFY26 (FY25:
61.6%; FY24: 63.6%). The bank witnessed an increase in the contribution of bulk deposits to 34.7% in 1HFY26 from
33.5% in FY24. The share of the 20 largest depositors to the total deposits of the bank stood at 11.8% in FY25 (FY24:
10.8%; FY23: 14.5%). Over the long term, AU SFB would benefit from its transition to a Universal Bank in terms of
improved brand recognition among depositors, which can help in further diversifying retail liabilities with pricing benefit,
reduction in mandatory capital adequacy and reduced priority sector lending requirement, which could aid growth.
Progress on this front remains a rating monitorable.
 
Liquidity
Adequate: AU SFB operated with gap of 13.8% (of total inflows) in asset-liability tenors in the up-to-one-year bucket as of
September 2025. The bank largely covers the gap with rollover of deposits and refinancing lines. It maintains adequate
refinance funding lines from refinancing institutions at any given point in time. The bank also benefits from access to
liquidity support mechanisms such as the liquidity adjustment facility, marginal standing facility, and the call money market,
enabling it to efficiently manage short-term liquidity requirements. During 2QFY26, the bank had a quarterly average
liquidity coverage ratio of 119%, which is above the regulatory requirement (100% for small finance banks).
 
Rating Sensitivities
Positive: Not Applicable.
 Negative: Events that could, individually or collectively, lead to a negative rating action are: 
a material decline in liquidity coverage ratio
an absence of a sustained improvement in the liability profile or a material decline in the CASA deposits proportion or
retail deposits.
a significant drop in the capital buffers
GNPAs as a percentage of the gross advances exceeding 5% on a sustained basis, thereby impacting the profitability
