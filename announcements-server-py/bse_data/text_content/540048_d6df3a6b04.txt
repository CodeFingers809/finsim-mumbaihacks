Ref: Disclosure regarding Cessation of an Independent Director dated November 15, 2025. 
Sub: Clarification regarding delay in submission 
We wish to inform you that the disclosure under Regulation 30 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 
2015 regarding the cessation of Mr. A. S. Anand Kumar (DIN: 00058292) as an Independent 
Director upon completion of his tenure was duly filed by the Company in XBRL format on 
November 12, 2025, within the prescribed timeline. 
However, due to an inadvertent oversight, the PDF disclosure was not submitted within the 
time limit specified in the applicable SEBI circular, despite the timely submission of the 
XBRL disclosure. 
The lapse was unintentional, and we assure you that the Company has taken note of the same 
and will ensure strict compliance going forward. 
Kindly take the above on record.  
Thanking you,
