India, Saudi push for early 
Bilateral Investment Treaty 
FM Nirmala holds talks with counterpart 
New Delhi, Nov 13: 
Union Finance Minister 
Nirmala Sitharaman held 
a bilateral meeting with 
Khalid Al-Falih, Minister 
of Investment, Saudi 
Arabia, on Wednesday in 
New Delhi, with the talks 
focusing on negotiations 
on the Bilateral Investment 
Treaty (BIT) between the 
two countries. 
According to a Finance 
Ministry post on X, the 
two sides emphasized 
on the need to conclude 
negotiations swiftly to 
unlock robust two-way 
foreign direct investment 
(FDI) and dcepen 
cconomic cooperation. During the meeting, 
Sitharaman highlighted 
that a modernized 
BIT framework would 
“strike the right balance 
safeguarding India’s policy space while ensuring 
that foreign investors 
have confidence in legal 
protections,” a stance she 
reiterated from her recent 
statements on revamping 
India’s model BIT to 
make it more investor- 
friendly. 
Saudi Arabia is a key 
partner for India, being 
the fifth-largest trading partner and a major source 
of crude oil imports. 
The discussions come 
amid ongoing efforts to 
diversify and strengthen 
India’s economic ties with 
West Asia, particularly under the government’s 
push to attract $100 
billion investments from 
the Gulf region in the 
coming years. 
The two leaders also 
explored opportunities to 
expand cooperation in 
sectors such as renewable 
energy, infrastructure, and 
technology, building on 
the momentum of recent 
high-level cngagements, 
including Prime Minister 
Narendra Modi’s state 
visit to Saudi Arabia 
carlier this year. 
An carly conclusion of the Bilateral Investment 
Treaty will not only 
boost two-way FDI but 
also open new avenues 
for collaboration across 
multiple sectors, said 
Minister Sitharaman after 
the meeting. 
Al-Falih is also reported 
to have echoed the similar 
sentiment that Saudi 
US sanctions Indian firms over ‘Washington, Nov. 13: 
The United States 
has announced sanctions 
against 32 companies 
and individuals from six 
countries, including India, 
accusing them of aiding

drone production.

by the US Department

While the statement 
did not reveal the names

Arabia remains committed 
to working closely with 
India to finalize the treaty 
at the earliest. 
The talks are part of a 
broader diplomatic push 
by India to negotiate BITs 
with strategic partners, 
including the UK, Qatar, 
and the European Union, 
part of its efforts 
to enhance the ease 
of doing business and 
attract sustained foreign 
investment. 
Negotiations on the 
India-Saudi Arabia BIT

Netanyahu now calls Iran 
permanent threat Tel Aviv, Nov 13: 
Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu, 
during an address to the 
Knesset, said that Iran 
remains a persistent threat 
to Isracl despite suffering 
crippling damage, and 
devastating losses during 
the 12-day war in June. 
Urging government and 
opposition lawmakers 
alike to maintain constant 
vigilance against Tehran, 
he warned that even 
though greatly weakened, 
Tehran remains dangerous 
and should not be 
underestimated. 
“We crushed Iran’s axis 
of evil. We distanced and 
neutralised the dual threat 
from Iran - the nuclear 
threat and the ballistic 
threat alike]” Netanyahu 
said in his address to 
parliament, as opposition 
members criticised his 
government’s handling 
of post-war diplomacy, 
reports Channel 12. 
“This is a real threat, 
but not what it once was. 
‘We act with determination, 
initiative, and strategy,” he 
added. 
The June conflict began 
after Israel launched a 
surprise military campaign 
targeting Iranian nuclear 
and military sites, 
prompting Tehran to 
retaliate  with hundreds 
of drones and ballistic 
missiles. The fighting 
quickly escalated, and 
ultimately drew in the 
US, which jointly attacked 
Iranian facilities with 
Israel. 
On June 22, the US Air 
Force fighter jets carried 
in the deepest levels 
remaining unharmed. out coo}'djx]n\ed strikes While a ceasefire was

Natanz, and Esfahan, remamned fargely in place 
and inflicted significant 
damage to the facilities, 
derailing the programme. 
Though, US President 
undisturbed, tensions have 
far from de-escalated, with 
officials in both countries 
being grimly certain that 
Donald Trump had  another confrontation was 
promptly ~deseribed o0 o gopjon ‘Washinton’s intervention IDF tricial 
as a total “success,” officials, 
claiming it had led to the 
“obliteration” of Iran’s 
nuclear infrastructure, that 
claim has since then been 
proven false, as even the 
US’ bunker buster bombs 
could not destroy all the 
underground floors in 
these facilities, with much 
of the equipment, records, 
and uranium stockpile 
confirming Tel Aviv's 
continued vigilance and 
surveillance of the Iran’s 
missile and nuclear 
development 
further warned that any 
future confrontation could 
be “longer, wider, 
far more destructive” than 
activities, 
and 
the last. 
Indian Army learning from current wars: Ghief New Delhi, Nov 13: 
Describing Ukraine as 
a “living lab” of modern 
warfare, Chief of Army 
Staff General Upendra 
Dwivedi said the Indian 
Armed Forces are actively 
integrating key tactical 
and technological lessons from the ongoing conflict 
to enhance combat pre- 
paredness and  strategic 
resilience. 
Speaking at the Delhi 
Defence Dialogue, held 
at Manohar Parrikar In- 
stitute for Defence Stud- 
are reaching much beyond 
100 km range, info-cam- 
paigns win wars even be- 
fore a single shell lands.” 
Referring to the ongoing 
“battle of narratives™ seen 
during the Russia-Ukraine 
conflict, the Army Chief 
cmphasized the growing 
importance of information 
warfare in shaping per- 
ceptions. “If the battle of 
narrative is, let’s say, the 
‘Western world and Russia 
is getting isolated, it does 
not mean that Russia is 
not winning the war or 
Ulkraine is not winning 
the war. So, you are not 
always getting the correct 
picture;” he said. 
Further, stressing the 
capability to produce and 
also a Kind of capability 
to export, is something 
important. And what we 
have realised majorly that 
earlier we used to say, just 
need for_self-reliance, in time, just in place and General Dwivedi said, only optimise resources. “The duration of war, Gone are those days. which T have said ear- 
lier also, it is 4 days, 4 
months or 4 years, we 
don’t know. So, what does 
it involve? It involves 
basically that aatmanirb- 
harta [self reliance] and 
We must have a surplus. Therefore, whatever re- source can be of dual use, that is something which should be given, primary importance.”
