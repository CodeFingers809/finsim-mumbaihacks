Dear Members of the Board, 
Pursuant to our discussions with the management following the recent change in ownership 
and induction of new promoters, we understand that the Company is undertaking a 
comprehensive strategic and operational realignment, including a review of all existing

In this context, the Company has conveyed its preference to appoint a new audit firm that is 
aligned with its revised strategic direction and group-level policies. After mutual discussions, 
it has been agreed that the Company would transition to another audit firm. 
Accordingly, we hereby tender our resignation as the Statutory Auditors of Kalind Limited 
(formerly known as Arunis Abode Limited) with effect from 19-Nov-2025. 
We thank the Board and the management for the cooperation extended to us during our
