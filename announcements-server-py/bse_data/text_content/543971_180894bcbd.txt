Dear Sir/Madam,

Requirements) Regulations, 2015, we’re enormously pleased to inform the Stock Exchange that M/s Bondada

The framework for this long-term partnership was signed by Shri Vineet Jain, Managing Director and CEO of 
Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL) and Dr Bondada Raghavendra Rao, Chairman and Managing Director, 
Bondada Engineering Limited (BEL) during a special ceremony at Adani Corporate Office, Shantigram, 
Ahmedabad on 18th November 2025. 
As the first tranche under this five-year Strategic Partnership Framework, Bondada Engineering Ltd, an order for 
650 MW solar energy works was recently awarded to BEL by AGEL. 
Adani Group has ambitious plans to play a significant role in turning the vast stretches of barren land in the 
Khavda region of Kutch district into green powerhouse of the nation under GoI’s RE Mission by setting up the 
world’s largest RE plant of 30 GW capacity in their Khavda RE park, for which Adani Group selected Bondada 
Group as their strategic design and construction partner.  
This Agreement is a befitting recognition to Bondada Engineering Ltd’s rapid strides in the RE sector and 
emergence as a major solar energy player in the national renewable energy space.

about 1.8 GW solar works in progress and another 2.5 GW orders in hand in addition to 2.0 GW IPP work in 
Andhra Pradesh, the company is set to play a significant role in achieving the national renewal energy mission.
