Inox Green provides Long-term O&M services for wind 
farm projects, wind turbine generators (“WTGs”) and the 
common infrastructure facilities on the wind farm which 
support the evacuation of power from WTGs.
The board of Inox Green approved the scheme of 
demerger of common infrastructure from Inox Green and 
merger of the same into Inox Renewable Solutions Ltd.
Post the board approval, the scheme has received ‘no 
objection’ from the stock exchanges and approvals from 
shareholders & creditors.
The scheme is being filed in the NCLT for its approval.
Post the NCLT approval, the common infrastructure will 
be demerged from Inox Green and merged into IRSL, 
leading to the consequential listing of IRSL and a cleaner 
and an asset-light balance sheet for Inox Green. 
The demerger will also eliminate the associated 
depreciation in the income statement to be reflected in 
higher profit after tax for Inox Green.

Organic growth opportunities
Inorganic growth opportunities
Customers across the board are looking for a switchover to a strong, credible, renowned and Indian O&M service provider . At 
Inox Green, we are well placed to capture this opportunity going forward.
Multiple opportunities to takeover O&M portfolios of large IPPs / developers who are currently managing majority of their 
portfolio captively.
Opportunities to enter into contracts with customers for projects where the existing contracts may have expired / are on the 
verge of expiring.
Growing the portfolio through new long-term O&M contracts with customers purchasing IWL’s WTGs – IWL’s order book of ~ 3.1 GW 
provides a very strong visibility.
Group’s foray into solar to add large scale solar project O&M to Inox Green’s portfolio; Inox Green has entered into exclusive arrangement 
with Inox Solar to provide O&M services to projects where Inox Solar will be supplying modules
O&M contracts from group IPP platform, which targets > 3 GW of installed capacity addition annually, to add to the growing portfolio.
Revision/Reset of existing O&M contracts.

FAVORABLE POLICY & REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

INDIA WIND SECTOR – A MULTI-DECADAL GROWTH STORY
Sources: CEA, SECI, MNRE, NIWE, GWEC, NITI Aayog, PIB, National Green Hydrogen Mission , JMK Research
• India targets 122 GW of installed wind capacity from 53 GW currently  – provides visibility of > Rs 5 trn for wind OEMs 
and a large multi-year opportunity for O&M service providers
• Demand from commercial & industrial (C&I) players for renewable power continues to be strong due to its green 
credentials and price arbitrage w.r.t. grid based / merchant power.
• India’s Green Hydrogen targets of 5 mmtpa may result in incremental ~ 125 GW of RE capacity addition (solar + wind)
• Wind continues to be one of the cheapest sources of power, much lower than APPC
• Wind’s complementarity to solar in Indian conditions makes it an important source for grid stabilization and higher grid 
utilization 
• Hybrid / RTC / FDRE projects, with significant proportion of wind capacity, is the way forward due to: 1. Higher project 
PLFs, 2. Increased grid utilization & stability, 3. Round-the-clock generation potentially replacing conventional sources for 
base power supply, 4. Lower LCoE and better IRRs for project developers
• GST on wind components reduced from 12% to 5%
• MNRE notifies ALMM (Wind) and ALMM (Wind Turbine Components) mandating domestic sourcing of ~75-80% of WTG 
components including blades, towers, gearbox, generators and special bearings, as well as locating R&D, data centers & 
servers within India
• CERC has notified amendments to connectivity and GNA regulations for ISTS, allowing hybridization of existing solar and 
wind transmission projects with capacity upwards of 50 MW.
• India’s onshore wind potential stands at 695 GW at 120m hub height and 1,164 GW at 150m hub height
• NIWE estimates India’s repowering potential at ~ 25 GW across multiple states
• India has announced a VGF scheme for setting up 1 GW of offshore wind capacity with ~ Rs 7,500 crore outlay
