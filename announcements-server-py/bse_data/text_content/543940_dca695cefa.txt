Media
 
Release
 
JioFinance
 
app
 
gets
 
a
 
new
 
feature
 
to
 
track
 
and
 
analyse
 
ﬁnances
 
seamlessly
 
in

Mumbai,
 
November
 
17,
 
2025:
 
Enhancing
 
the
 
way
 
people
 
engage
 
with
 
their
 
money,
 
a
 
powerful
 
new
 
feature
 
has
 
been
 
launched
 
on
 
the
 
JioFinance
 
app,
 
which
 
enables
 
users
 
to
 
bring
 
together
 
what
 
matters
 
in
 
their
 
ﬁnancial
 
life
 
on
 
to
 
one
 
uniﬁed,
 
secure,
 
and
 
intelligent
 
platform.
 
It
 
allows
 
users
 
to
 
seamlessly
 
link,
 
view
 
and
 
analyse
 
all
 
their
 
bank
 
accounts,
 
mutual
 
funds
 
and
 
stock
 
portfolios
 
in
 
one
 
single
 
place,
 
without
 
the
 
hassle
 
of
 
viewing
 
multiple
 
apps.
 
 
 
In
 
an
 
increasingly
 
fragmented
 
ﬁnancial
 
ecosystem,
 
individuals
 
often
 
struggle
 
to
 
track
 
multiple
 
accounts,
 
apps,
 
and
 
providers.
 
The
 
JioFinance
 
app
 
solves
 
this
 
by
 
consolidating,
 
analysing,
 
and
 
personalising
 
ﬁnancial
 
recommendations,
 
based
 
on
 
user
 
consent.
 
It
 
gives
 
users
 
a
 
clear
 
and
 
nuanced
 
understanding
 
of
 
their
 
cash
 
ﬂow
 
trends,
 
expenses
 
and
 
investment,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
recommendations
 
for
 
better
 
money
 
management.
 
This
 
feature
 
helps
 
people
 
align
 
day-to-day
 
spending
 
patterns
 
with
 
their
 
long-term
 
goals,
 
using
 
advanced
 
analytics
 
and
 
smart
 
insights
 
to
 
simplify
 
decision-making.
 
The
 
key
 
features
 
of
 
the
 
platform
 
include:
 
 
 
●
 
Uniﬁed
 
Financial
 
Dashboard:
 
Brings
 
together
 
all
 
ﬁnancial
 
relationships
 
—
 
from
 
loans
 
and
 
deposits
 
held
 
within
 
JioFinance
 
to
 
linked
 
external
 
accounts
 
and
 
investments
 
—
 
providing
 
a
 
consolidated,
 
real-time
 
view
 
of
 
a
 
user’s
 
ﬁnances.
 
●
 
Comprehensive
 
Asset
 
Tracking:
 
Enables
 
users
 
to
 
link
 
and
 
track
 
Bank
 
Accounts
 
(CASA)
 
for
 
real-time
 
balances
 
and
 
spending
 
insights,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
Mutual
 
Funds,
 
Equities,
 
and
 
ETFs
 
with
 
portfolio
 
and
 
performance
 
analysis.
 
Soon,
 
support
 
for
 
Fixed
 
and
 
Recurring
 
Deposits
 
will
 
oﬀer
 
an
 
even
 
more
 
complete
 
picture
 
of
 
a
 
user’s
 
ﬁnancial
 
world.
 
●
 
Smart,
 
Data-Driven
 
Guidance:
 
Goes
 
beyond
 
simple
 
tracking
 
with
 
AI-powered
 
insights
 
and
 
nudges,
 
oﬀering
 
personalised
 
recommendations
 
to
 
help
 
users
 
make
 
better
 
ﬁnancial
 
decisions.
 
 
To

management,
