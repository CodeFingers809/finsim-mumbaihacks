3 We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410 ‘Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity', issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of india. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of the Company’s personnel responsible for financial and accounting matters and applying analytical and other review procedures, A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an zudit opinion. 
Basis for Qualified Conclusion 
4. The Company is primarily engaged in providing heavy machinery, including earth-moving equipment, to customers along with operator and fuel, During the year, the Company has also hired certain machinery from third parties. The management has not provided a proper reconciliation or correlation between (a) machinery taken on hire from third parties and (b) the machinery deployed for execution of customer contracts, including the related hirs income and hire charges.

In the absence of such information, we were unable to verify the accuracy, completeness, and 
allocation of hire income, hire charges, and related expenses recognized during the year. 
Consequently, we are unable to determine and quantify whether any adjustments are necessary 
to the accompanying financial statements in respect of these items. 
Qualified Conclusion 
5. Based on our review conducted as stated in paragraph 3 above, except for the possible effects 
of the matters described in the Basis for Qualified Conclusion paragraph above, nothing has 
come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in 
accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian 
Accounting Standards and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not 
disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of Listing 
Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material

Financial Results of the Company Pursuant to the Regulation 33 and 52 of the SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirement s} Regulations, 2015, as amended 
Review Report to 
The Board of Directors 
Kalind Limited 
(Formerly known as Arunis Abode Limited) 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results of 
Kalind Limited (Formerly known as Arunis Abode Limited), (the "Holding Company") and its 
subsidiary (the Holding Company and its subsidiary together referred to as "the Group"), for the 
quarter ended September 30 , 2025 and year to date from April 1, 2025 to September 30, 2025 
(the "Statement”) attached herewith, being submitted by the Holding Company pursuant to the 
requirements of Regulation 33 and 52 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, as amended (the "Listing Regulations”). 
2. The Holding Company's Management is responsible for the preparation of the Statement in 
accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting 
Standard 34, (Ind AS 34) "Interim Financial Reporting” prescribed under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 20 13 as amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 and 
52 of the listing Regulations. The Statement has been approved by the Holding Company’s Board 
of Directors. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements 
(SRE) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the 
Entity” issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan 
and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the Statement is free of material 
misstatement. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of 
persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review 
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with 
Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would 
become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion. 
We also performed procedures in accordance with the Master Circular issued by the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India under Regulation 33(8) of the Listing Regulations, to the extent applicable. 
4. The Statement includes the results of the entities mentioned in Annexure I. 
5. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above 
and based on the consideration of the review reports of other auditors referred to in paragraph 6 
below, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, 
prepared in accordance with recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid 
Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS’) specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 
2013, as amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in 
terms of the Listing Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains 
any material misstatement.

measurement principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial 
Reporting”, prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with relevant rules 
issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our 
responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 ‘Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity’, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A 
review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of the Company’s 
personnel responsible for financial and accounting matters and applying analytical and other 
review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in 
accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain 
assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an 
audit. Accordingly. we do not express an audit opinion. 
Basis for Qualified Conclusion 
4. The Company is primarily engaged in providing heavy machinery, including earth-moving 
equipment, to customers along with operator and fuel. During the year, the Company has also 
hired certain machinery from third parties. The management has not provided a proper 
reconciliation or correlation between (a) machinery taken on hire from third parties and (b) the 
machinery deployed for execution of customer contracts, including the related hire income and 
hire charges.

In the absence of such information, we were unable to verify the accuracy, completeness, and 
allocation of hire income, hire charges, and related expenses recognized during the year. 
Consequently, we are unable to determine and quantify whether any adjustments are necessary 
to the accompanying financial statements in respect of these items. 
Qualified Conclusion 
5. Based on our review conducted as stated in paragraph 3 above, except for the possible effects 
of the matters described in the Basis for Qualified Conclusion paragraph above, nothing has 
come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in 
accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian 
Accounting Standards and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not 
disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of Listing 
Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material 
misstatement.

information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and

opinion.
