Limited Review Report on unaudited standalone financial results of Hindustan Oil 
Exploration Company Limited for the quarter ended 30 September 2025 and year to 
date results for the period from 01 April 2025 to 30 September 2025 pursuant to 
Regulation 33 of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended 
 
To the Board of Directors of Hindustan Oil Exploration Company Limited 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of unaudited standalone financial results of 
Hindustan Oil Exploration Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as “the Company”) for the 
quarter ended  30 September 2025 and year to date results for the period from 01 April to 30 
September 2025 (“the Statement”) (in which are included unaudited financial information of 11 
unincorporated joint operations). 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company’s management and approved by its Board 
of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid 
down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” (“Ind AS 34”), prescribed under 
Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India 
and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (“Listing Regulations”). 
Our responsibility is to issue a report on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements 
(SRE) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the 
Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial 
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting 
matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope 
than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable 
us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified 
in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe 
that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement 
principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standard and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of 
Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it 
contains any material misstatement. 
5. The standalone financial results of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2025 were audited by 
the predecessor auditor whose report dated 28 May 2025 had expressed an unmodified opinion. The 
standalone financial results of the Company for the corresponding quarter ended 30 September 2024 
and the corresponding period from 1 April 2024 to 30 September 2024 were reviewed by the 
predecessor auditor whose report dated 14 November 2024 had expressed an unmodified 
conclusion. 
6. The standalone financial results of the Company for the three months ended 30 June 2025 were 
reviewed by the predecessor auditor whose report dated 14 August 2025 had expressed an 
unmodified conclusion.

Limited Review Report (Continued) 
Hindustan Oil Exploration Company Limited 
7. The Statement includes the unaudited financial information of 7 unincorporated joint operations which 
have not been reviewed, whose unaudited financial information reflects Company's share of total 
assets of Rs. 2,582.69 Lakhs as at 30 September 2025 and Company's share of total revenues of 
Rs. 215.86 Lakhs and Rs. 331.11 Lakhs for the quarter ended 30 September 2025 and for the period 
from 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025 respectively. as considered in the Statement. According to 
the information and explanations given to us by the management, these interim financial information 
are not material to the Company. 
8. We have placed reliance on technical/commercial evaluation by the management in respect of 
categorization of the wells as exploratory, development, producing and dry wells, allocation of costs 
incurred on them, proven developed hydrocarbon reserves and depletion thereof on the Oil and Gas 
assets, impairment and liability for site restoration costs. 
 
Our conclusion is not modified in respect of these matters referred to in points 7 and 8 above.

Limited Review Report on unaudited consolidated financial results of Hindustan Oil 
Exploration Company Limited for the quarter ended 30 September 2025 and year to 
date results for the period from 01 April 2025 to 30 September 2025 pursuant to 
Regulation 33 of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended 
 
To the Board of Directors of Hindustan Oil Exploration Company Limited 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of unaudited consolidated financial results of 
Hindustan Oil Exploration Company Limited  (hereinafter referred to as “the Parent”), and its 
subsidiaries (the Parent and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”) for the quarter ended 
30 September 2025 and year to date results for the period from 01 April 2025 to 30 September 2025 
(“the Statement”) (in which are included unaudited financial information of 11 unincorporated joint 
operations), being submitted by the Parent pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, as amended ("Listing Regulations"). 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Parent’s management and approved by the Parent’s 
Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement 
principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 “ Interim Financial Reporting ” (“Ind AS 34”), 
prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. Our responsibility 
is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements 
(SRE) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the 
Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial 
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting 
matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope 
than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable 
us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified 
in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
We also performed procedures in accordance with the circular issued by the Securities and Exchange 
Board of India under Regulation 33(8) of the Listing Regulations, to the extent applicable. 
4. The Statement includes the results of the entities mentioned in Annexure I to the Statement. 
5. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above and based 
on the consideration of the review reports of the other auditors referred to in paragraph 8 below, 
nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, 
prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid 
Indian Accounting Standard and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not 
disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations, 
including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement. 
6. The consolidated financial results of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2025 were audited by 
the predecessor auditor whose report dated 28 May 2025 had expressed an unmodified opinion. The 
consolidated financial results of the Group for the corresponding quarter ended 30 September 2024 
and the corresponding period from 1 April 2024 to 30 September 2024 were reviewed by the 
predecessor auditor whose report dated 14 November 2024 had expressed an unmodified 
conclusion. 
7. The consolidated financial results of the Group for the quarter and three months ended 30 June 2025 
were reviewed by the predecessor auditor whose report dated 14 August 2025 had expressed an 
unmodified conclusion.

the period from 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025. as considered in the Statement. These interim 
financial statements have been reviewed by other auditor whose report has been furnished to us by

adjustments) of Rs. 777.25 Lakhs for the period from 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025. as 
considered in the Statement. According to the information and explanations given to us by the 
Parent’s management, this interim financial information are not material to the Group. 
11. We have placed reliance on technical/commercial evaluation by the management in respect of 
categorization of the wells as exploratory, development, producing and dry wells, allocation of costs 
incurred on them, proven developed hydrocarbon reserves and depletion thereof on the Oil and Gas 
assets, impairment and liability for site restoration costs.
