III. OTHER INFORMATION
 1. Reasons of loss or inadequate profits
  Our financial performance has been primarily influenced 
by two significant market challenges. First, we operate in 
an environment marked by volatility in the supply and 
pricing of essential raw materials. This unpredictability 
creates operational inefficiencies and can pressure our 
margins. Second, we navigate a highly competitive 
global landscape, where we must directly contend with 
large-scale manufacturers, particularly from China, which 
impacts both market share and pricing.
 2. Steps taken or proposed to be taken for improvement
  To address these challenges, we have implemented a 
proactive, two-pronged strategy:
  •  Supply Chain Stabilization: We have enhanced our 
inventory management system by strategically 
stockpiling key raw materials. This forward-
purchasing approach mitigates supply disruption 
risks and provides a buffer against market price 
fluctuations.
  •  Competitive Differentiation: Our core focus is on 
outperforming competitors through superior 
quality and innovation. We are making continuous 
investments in R&D to not only enhance our existing 
product lines but also to pioneer new solutions 
tailored for both our domestic and international 
customers.
 3. Expected increase in productivity and profits
  We are optimistic about a significant improvement in our 
financial trajectory. Our operations are tightly managed 
within budgetary constraints, reinforcing the company’s 
going concern strength. This internal discipline, combined 
with powerful external tailwinds, positions us for growth.
  A major catalyst is the Indian government’s accelerated 
investment in national infrastructure, specifically the 
rapid expansion of roads, ports, and highways. This 
boom will directly benefit the cement, steel, and mining 
sectors key end-users of our primary product, Conveyor 
Belting Fabrics. Furthermore, the anticipated growth in 
the automobile and tire industry, another critical market 
for our products, provides an additional and compelling 
avenue for increased demand and revenue.
