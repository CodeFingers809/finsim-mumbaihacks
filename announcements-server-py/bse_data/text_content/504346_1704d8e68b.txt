Limited Review Report 
To, 
The Board of Directors 
RRP SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED 
(Formerly known as GD Trading & Agencies Limited) 
“We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results of M/s RRP 
Semiconductor Limited (‘The Company’) for the quarter ended 30" September, 2025 being 
submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements), Regulations, 2015. This statement is the responsibility 
of the Company’s management and has been approved by the Board of Directors at their meeting 
held on 14" November, 2025. This statement has been prepared in accordance with the 
recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standards 34 (Ind AS 
34’), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with relevant rules issued 
there under and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to 
issue a report on the financial results based on our review. 
We conducted review of the statement in accordance with the standard of Review Engagement 
(SRE) 2410, “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by Independent Auditor of the 
Entity” issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we 
plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the statement is free 
from material misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of company personnel and 
an analytical procedure applied to financial data thus provide less assurance than as audit. We 
have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
Based on our review Conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results for the quarter ended 30" 
September, 2025 prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting standards 
specified and other recognized accounting practices and policies has not disclosed the 
information required to be disclosed in term of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligation and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, 
or that it contain any material misstatement. 
Other Matter 
Furtherance to our above report, We draw attention to the following matters disclosed by the 
Company, which continue to be relevant to the current quarter: 
1. Subcontract arrangement, revenue reversal and ongoing dispute: 
The Company had entered into a subcontract agreement with Telecrown Infratech Put. 
Ltd. for supply and installation of solar panels. Revenue of ¥14.82 crores + taxes, 
recognised during the quarter ended 31 December 2024, was partially reversed in the 
quarter ended 31 March 2025 due to contractual disagreements.

remained unresolved. The Com 
of ¥12.00 crores from the Prin 
initiated legal recovery proceed 
pany has informed that it is holding a post-dated cheque 
cipal Contractor against an earlier deposit and has also 
ings, including issuance of a legal notice. 
Costs of 3.72 crores + taxes incurred on site preparation and contractual obligations remain outstanding. Material purchases of %5.20 crores + taxes from Total Solar Technologies Pvt. Ltd. were returned and reversed. 
2. Preferential allotment — withdrawal request The Board considered a request from one of the preferential allottees, Mr. Rajendra Chodankar, seeking withdrawal of his application. The Company had requested Mr. Chodankar to provide the underlying rationale for his proposed withdrawal; however, no reasons were provided. In the absence of such reasons, the Board concluded that no further action is warranted at this stage. 
3. Exceptional share price movement & clarifications to BSE 
The equity shares of the Company have experienced an exceptionally sharp increase in market price during recent periods, not commensurate with the current scale of operations. We had sought clarification from the Management on this matter. 
The Company has informed that it has issued the following clarifications to BSE: 
o The legendary cricketer Mr. Sachin Tendulkar is not connected with the 
Company in any manner, including not being a shareholder. 
o No land has been allotted to the Company by the Government of 
Maharashtra. 
The Company has initiated legal action against circulating false or misleading 
rumours. 
The Company has further informed that 100% of its equity share capital (preferential allotment) is under lock-in till 31 March 2026, and that none of the Directors or KMP have traded in the Company’s securities. 
4. Appeal before Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) regarding revocation of listing 
approval: ) 
The Company has informed that BSE had granted in-principle approval under Regulation 28 of the SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015, followed by listing approval 
dated 25 June 2024 and trading approval dated 16 July 2024, in respect of 1 ,35,24,000 equity shares issued through preferential allotment on 31 May 2024 and 05 June 2024. 
Subsequently, BSE issued a Show Cause Notice in connection with the listing of the above shares, based on delisting proceedings pertaining. to another entity, Shree 
Vindhya Paper Mills Limited, in which the Company is a corporate promoter 
shareholder. On 08 April 2025, BSE passed an order revoking the earlier listing 
approval. 
The Company has filed an appeal before the Hon'ble Secyritifes Appellate Tribunal 
(“SAT") vide Appeal No. 221 of 2025, and the Hon'ble SAT, vide |nter.|m order dated 02 
May 2025, has directed to maintain status quo with respect to the said BSE order. 
The matter remains sub-judice and the final outcome is pending. We are therefore 
unable to comment on any possible financial impact, if any, arising from the resoluti 
of this matter.
