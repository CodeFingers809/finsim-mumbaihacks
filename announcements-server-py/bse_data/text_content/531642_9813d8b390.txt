Limited Review Report on unaudited consolidated financial results of Marico Limited for the quarter ended 30 September 2025 and year to date results for the period from 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025 pursuant to Regulation 33 of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amendedTo the Board of Directors of Marico Limited1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of unaudited consolidated financial results of Marico Limited (hereinafter referred to as “the Parent”), and its subsidiaries (the Parent and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”) for the quarter ended 30 September 2025 and year to date results for the period from 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025 (“the Statement”) being submitted by the Parent pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended ("Listing Regulations").2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Parent’s management and approved by the Parent’s Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” (“Ind AS 34”), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review.3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.We also performed procedures in accordance with the circular issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India under Regulation 33(8) of the Listing Regulations, to the extent applicable.4. The Statement includes the results of the entities mentioned in Annexure I to the Statement5. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above and based on the consideration of the review reports of the other auditors referred to in paragraph 6 below, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standard and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.

Limited Review Report on unaudited standalone financial results of Marico Limited for the quarter ended 30 September 2025 and year to date results for the period from 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025 pursuant to Regulation 33 of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amendedTo the Board of Directors of Marico Limited1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of unaudited standalone financial results of Marico Limited (hereinafter referred to as “the Company”) for the quarter ended 30 September 2025 and year to date results for the period from 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025 (“the Statement”) (in which are included interim financial information of its Employee Welfare Trust).2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company’s management and approved by its Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” (“Ind AS 34”), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (“Listing Regulations”). Our responsibility is to issue a report on the Statement based on our review.3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standard and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.For B S R & Co.
