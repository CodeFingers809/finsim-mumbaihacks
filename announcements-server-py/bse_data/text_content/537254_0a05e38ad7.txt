Independent Auditor’s Review Report on the Quarterly Unaudited Standalone Financial Results of the Company 
Pursuant to Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements ) Regulations, 2015, as 
amended 
 
Review Report To 
 
To The  Monitoring Committee  
 RCI Industries and Technologies Limited 
 
 
1. Corporate Insolvency Proceeding as per Insolvency and bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) : 
 
The Application was filed by the Standard Chartered Bank (Singapore) Limited (Opera tional Creditor) under 
section 9 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (Code) fo r commencement of Corporate Insolvency 
Resolution Process (CIRP) in the matter of RCI I ndustries & Technologies Limited (“Corporate Debtor” or 
“Company”). Hon’ble National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) New Delhi vide its orde r dated November 25, 
2022 in C.P (IB) No. 2688 of 2019, commenced the CIRP in the m atter of Corporate Debtor and appointed Mr. 
Brijesh Singh Bhadauriya as Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) subsequently c onfirming him as the 
Resolution Professional ("RP") under the provisions of the Code. The said order was uploaded on the website and 
available to the RP on November 30, 2022. 
 
2. We have been informed by the Erstwhile Resolution Professional and chairman of the monitoring committee that 
the Directors, Statutory Auditors, and Compliance Officer of the Company were not cooperative in providing the 
desired information and documents promptly to the RP. Consequently, the RP was constrained to file an 
Intervention Application under Section 19( 2) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 before the Ho n’ble 
National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) [IA No. 1396/2023 dated 03.03.2023], seeking necessary directions to 
the Directors, Statutory Auditors, and Compliance Officer of the Company to p rovide the required information 
and documents. The RP has further informed that despite such application; proper and complete data has still not 
been provided to the RP till date. 
 
3. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), New Delhi, vide its order dated 9 October 2025, approved the 
resolution plan submitted by JTL Industries Limited for the revival of the RCI Industries & Technologies Limited. 
The said resolution plan for revival of the company is currently under implem entation under the supervision of 
the Monitoring Committee constituted as per the approved resolution plan.  Accordingly, the financial results have 
been prepared on a going concern basis, considering the ongoing implem entation of the resolution plan and the 
expected revival of the Company. Management has evaluated the transaction as a non-adjusting subsequent event, 
and necessary disclosure has been made in the financial statements in accordance with the applicable accounting 
standards. 
 
4. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Standalone Unaudited Financial Results of RCI Industries & 
Technologies Limited (“the Company”) for the quarter ended June 30, 202 5 (“the Statement”), which has been 
submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (“Listing Regulations”).  
 
5. The Company’s Management is responsible for the preparation of the Statement in accordance with the 
recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standar d 34, (Ind AS 34) “Interim 
Financial Reporting” prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, as amended, read with r elevant 
rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with

Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. The Statement has been approved by the  monitoring committee. Our 
responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
 
6. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410, 
“Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity” issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This Standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain 
moderate assurance as to whether the Statement is free of material misstatement. A review of inter im financial 
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsibl e for financial and accounting matters, 
and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in sco pe than an audit 
conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that 
we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit.  Accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion. 
 
 
7. Basis for Qualified Conclusions 
 
1. The suspended management did not provide Fixed Asset Register as on the date o f the commencement of the 
Insolvency proceedings on 25.11.2022 as was informed to us by the Resolution Professional during the CIRP . 
Major details such as cost of assets, accumulated depreciation of previous years, actual purchase dates, invoice 
numbers, vendor names, and appropriate descriptions of assets are not available in the depreciation chart provided 
to us. 
              Further, during our audit, we observed the following: 
• Significant discrepancies were noted in the depreciation chart, including non-availability of certain assets, 
existence of assets not recorded, mismatches in descriptions/models, absence of asset tags , and weak internal 
controls. 
• As per the report of the independent Chartered Engineer appointed by th e Erstwhile Resolution Professional , 
certain items of Plant & Machinery were found to be idle, non-functional, red undant, and materially overstated. 
Further, the Chartered Engineer has also reported that various items of Plant & Machinery were missing as on the 
CIRP date. Also, machinery purchased from Devi Metals was overstated by 40–50%, second-hand machinery by 
40–50%, and new machinery by 30–35%. 
• Supporting documents such as invoices, purchase orders, and ownership proo fs for major items of Plant & 
Machinery were not made available to us. Accordingly, we were unable to verif y capitalization, ownership, and 
valuation of such assets. 
• Certain vehicles recorded in the books are registered in the names of third par ties, raising doubt over the 
Company’s ownership rights in respect of such assets. 
• Scrap and redundant assets were identified; however, no provision or write-off has been recognized in the financial 
statements. 
• As per the Forensic Audit Report dated 16.08.2023, the Corporate Debtor had manipulated asset classification by 
routing transactions through accounts such as “Creation of Fixed Assets”  and “Creation of Assets” , thereby 
converting fixed assets into current assets and vice versa. These practices, carried out at periodic intervals, appear 
to have been adopted to manipulate financial ratios and facilitate submissions made to lenders against credit 
exposures. Such irregular accounting treatment indicates potential misstatement of financial statements and non-
compliance with applicable accounting standards.

Because of the significance of the matters described above, we were unable to obtain su fficient appropriate audit 
evidence to verify the existence, ownership, valuation, and completeness of the b alance of Property, Plant and 
Equipment (PPE) and depreciation reported in the financial statements. 
2. As per the report of the independent Chartered Engineer appointed by th e Erstwhile Resolution Professional , 
certain items recorded under Capital Work- in-Progress (CWIP) in the books of account and the depreciation 
register provided by the erstwhile management were not physically available at the Plant as o n the date of 
commencement of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP). 
The financial impact of these discrepancies has not been quantified or recognized in the accompanying financial 
statements. Accordingly, we were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evide nce regarding the existence 
and valuation of CWIP as reported in the financial statements. 
3. The Company holds equity investments in certain group companies. In accord ance with Ind AS 109 “Financial 
Instruments”, such investments are required to be measured at fair value through profit  or loss as at the balance 
sheet date and the resulting gain/loss should be recognized in the financial statements.  However, no such fair 
valuation has been carried out by the management due to no information being provided and shared by these group 
companies with Resolution Professional during the CIRP. 
 
Further, we have not been provided with agreements relating to these investments,  nor have we been provided 
with the financial statements of the investee companies. In the absence of fair valuation and sufficient appropriate 
audit evidence, we are unable to determine the correctness of the carrying value of these investments and the 
consequential impact on the financial statements, including the Statement of Profit and  Loss and related 
disclosures. 
 
4. Company faces a material uncertainty related to Going Concern because of heavy  losses incurred during the 
current and previous periods. Further, the net worth of the Company  has been fully eroded. These conditions 
indicate the existence of a material uncer tainty that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. In our opinion, the financial statement however has been prepared by the management 
on a going concern basis for the reason as stated. Based on the information available, the Company was admitted 
to Insolvency proceedings under section 9 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (Code) and the Corporate 
Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) in the matter of RCI Industries & Tec hnologies Limited (“Corporate 
Debtor” or “Company”) commenced with effect from 25.11.2022 consequent upon Order of the Hon’ble National 
Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) New Delhi vide its order dated November 25, 2 022 in C.P (IB) No. 2688 of 
2019. During the CIRP process, the resolution plan submitted by the JTL Industries Ltd. was approved by the 
Committee of Creditors (CoC) followed by the approval of the same by the  Hon'ble NCLT vide its order dated 
9.10.2025. The said resolution plan for revival of the company is cu rrently under implementation under the 
supervision of the Monitoring Committee constituted as per the approved resolution plan.  Accordingly, the 
financial results have been prepared on a going concern basis, considering the ongoing implementation of the 
resolution plan and the likelihood of rival as per the approval of a Resolution Plan, the financial statements of the 
Company have been prepared on a going concern basis. Accordingly , we conclude that the use of the going 
concern assumption in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements is appropriate under the given 
circumstances. 
 
5. The Company’s net worth has been fully eroded and it was under severe financial stress at the commencement of 
the CIRP on 25.11.2022. Based on the information and explanations g iven to us, and on the basis of financial 
ratios, ageing and expected realization of financial assets, payment schedules of finan cial liabilities, other

Bankruptcy Code 2016, and our examination of the evidence supporting the assumption, all liabilities and claims, 
against the Company, which are not part of the Resolution Plan, shall stand ex tinguished and no person will be 
entitled to initiate or continue any proceeding in respect to a claims which is not part of the resolution plan. All 
liabilities incurred during the CIRP period to keep the Company as a going concern, have been met as part of the 
CIRP Cost. Therefore, there does not exist any material uncertainty indicating that the Company is not capable of 
meeting its liabilities existing as at the balance sheet date as and when they fall due within a perio d of one year 
from the balance sheet date. 
6. A Transaction-cum-Forensic Audit was carried out for the period April 01, 20 17 to November 25, 2022 (as the 
books of accounts for the period April 01, 2015 to March 31, 2017 have not been made available by the suspended 
director till date). The forensic auditor has reported preferential, undervalued, fraudulent, and extortionate 
transactions aggregating to ₹369.71 crores, covered under  Sections 43, 45, 50, and 66 of the Insolvency and 
Bankruptcy Code, 2016. Applications for reversal of these transactions ha ve been filed before the Hon’ble 
National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). 
In view of the pending adjudication of these matters before the Hon’ble NCLT an d absence of sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence regarding the recoverability and ultimate impact of such  transactions on the financial 
statements, we are unable to comment on the adjustments, if any, that may be r equired in the accompanying 
financial results. 
7. We draw attention to the findings reported in the Forensic Audit carried out by an independent forensic auditor 
appointed by the Erstwhile Resolution Professional and chairman of the monitoring committee. As per the forensic 
audit report, the Corporate Debtor had sold land situated at Nalagarh on 31st December 2019, originally purchased 
for ₹2.29 crores, to M/s AKJ Metals Private Limited for ₹2.30 crores, resulting in a nominal gain of ₹1 lakh. 
The forensic auditor has observed that the fair market value of the said land, as per the Valuation Report dated 
15th May 2023, was ₹9.06 crores. Based on reverse calculation using the Cost of Inflation Index, the indexed cost 
was worked out at ₹7.52 crores, resulting in an imputed loss/fraud of app roximately ₹5.22 crores, which has 
neither been recognized in the books of account nor appropriately disclosed in the financial statements.  
Further, it has been noted that during the period under review, there have b een no transactions involving related 
parties and entities having influence over the Corporate Debtor, indicating that the transaction may be prejudicial 
to the interests of the Company and its stakeholders. 
 
8. The Company has received regulatory notices and summons from various government authorities, including the 
Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO), Enforcement Directorate (ED), Directo rate General of GST 
Intelligence (DGGST), and the Income Tax Department. Investigations by DGGST allege frau dulent availment 
of fake Input Tax Credit (ITC) amounting to approximately ₹214 cro res through paper invoices, dummy 
companies, and other contrived arrangements, purportedly under the direction of the erstwhile Managing Director. 
Pending conclusion of the said investigations and proceedings, the management/E rstwhile Resolution 
Professional and chairman of the monitoring committee has not made any adjustmen ts or disclosures of possible 
financial implications in the accompanying financial results. In the absence of suffi cient appropriate audit 
evidence to evaluate the possible financial impact of such regulatory actions on the financial statements, we are 
unable to determine whether any adjustments are required to the carrying amoun ts of assets, liabilities, expenses 
and disclosures.

9. The Company has received notices and is subject to investigations by various ag encies, including FIR No. 
182/2022 registered by the Economic Offence Wing, New Delhi, and FIR No. 615/2023  registered by Police 
Station Madhav Nagar, Katni, M.P., in relation to allegations of fraud, misappropriation,  and non-return of job 
work material. These matters are presently under investigation. 
Pending the outcome of such investigations and in the absence of suff icient appropriate audit evidence, no 
adjustments have been made in the accompanying financial statements for any poten tial financial implications 
arising therefrom. Accordingly, we are unable to determine whether any adjustments ar e required to the carrying 
values of assets, liabilities, expenses, or disclosures. 
10. Company borrowings were declared as non performing asset (NPA) during the year ended March 31, 2020. A ll 
liabilities and claims, against the Company, which are not part of the Resolution Plan,  shall stand extinguished 
and no person will be entitled to initiate or continue any proceeding in respect to a claim which is not part of the 
resolution plan. Due to this, we have not been provided with any document confirming balan ces, as at June 30 , 
2025, for loans granted by financial institutions and banks, BG Invocation liability towards banks, bill discounting 
liability towards banks, certain current accounts and fixed deposits held by the Company. In the absence of such 
document, we cannot comment on the accuracy and completeness of these balances. T he Company has not 
recognized interest expenses in its financial statement on its outstanding borrowings. 
  
11. The Company has received multiple notices from the Income Tax Department, including: 
 
• Notice under Section 221(1)  dated July 31, 2025, from the Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax , Central 
Circle 32, Delhi, indicating substantial outstanding tax demands across several assessmen t years. The Company 
has been directed to show cause why penalty should not be levied for non-p ayment of these demands. 
• Notice under Section 148A(3)  dated June 28, 2025, for Assessment Year 2019 –20, wherein the Income Tax 
Department has alleged that the Company engaged in bogus sale-purchase transactions and claimed fraudulent 
Input Tax Credit (ITC) amounting to ₹214.34 crores during FY 2017– 18 and FY 2018–19. The corresponding 
fake purchase transactions are estimated at ₹1,190.78 crores. The notice further states that the Company failed 
to provide substantive documentary evidence and that the transactions with var ious entities were found to be 
merely on paper, with no actual movement of goods. As a result, income aggregatin g to ₹915.00 crores is 
considered to have escaped assessment under Section 147 of the Act. 
The Company has responded to the notices citing the moratorium under Section 1 4 of the Insolvency and 
Bankruptcy Code, 2016, due to its ongoing Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP). However, the tax 
authorities have rejected this contention and proceeded with reopening the assessment.   
We also understand that the Income Tax Department has filed claim before the RP as per the IBC, 2016 in respect 
of their claim as on the CIRP commencement date for Rs. 79,37,03,360/- raised till 12.12.2022 upto the 
Assessment Year 2020-21 and the said claim would be dealt with as per the Resolution  Plan to be approved by 
the Hon’ble NCLT in due course.  
In the absence of sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the resolution of these matters, the potential 
financial impact of penalties, tax liabilities, and adjustments arising from these proceedings  cannot be reliably 
estimated. Accordingly, we are unable to determine the consequential effect, if any , on the financial results for 
the quarter ended June 30, 2025.

Based on our review conducted as above, except for the effects/possible effects of the matters specified in Para 6 above , 
nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with 
the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standards and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed 
the information required to be disclosed in term of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015, including the manner in which it is to be d isclosed, or that it contains any material 
misstatement. 
 
In addition to the matters described above, we consider it necessary, in the interest of stakeholders and public interest, to 
draw attention to certain significant issues, which have been included by us in the Other Matter paragraphs below. 
 
 
8. Other Matters: 
 
(a) The Company has incurred continuous losses, its current liabilities exceed current ass ets, and it has defaulted in 
repayment of borrowings as well as in payment of certain regulatory and statutory dues. These conditions indicate 
the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continu e as a 
going concern. 
 
(b) The accounts, however, have been prepared by the management on a going concern basis, considering the reasons 
stated in the financial results and the approval of a resolution plan submitted b y M/s JTL Industries Limited, the 
approval of a resolution plan submitted by M/s JTL Industries, which was approved by the Committee of Creditors 
followed by the approval of the Hon’ble NCLT on 9.10.2025. 
 
(c) In view of the ongoing implementation of the Resolution Plan post completion of th e Corporate Insolvency 
Resolution Process (CIRP) and various matters pending before regulatory autho rities, the outcome of which 
cannot presently be ascertained, a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant dou bt on the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. 
(d) The forensic audit has reported that the Corporate Debtor has an outstanding balance  with M/s Shilpi Cable 
Technologies Limited, amounting to ₹48.36 crores, pertaining to transactions  of earlier years. As per external 
investigations, including those by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) , M/s Shilpi Cable Technologies 
Limited and its promoters have been accused of allegedly cheating a consortium of banks to the extent of ₹1,000 
crores, involving misuse of Letters of Credit, diversion of funds, and ex cess payments. The Company’s books of 
account reflect no sales to this party, though payments were received in earlier years and adjusted against London 
Metal Exchange (LME) differences. 
(e) The forensic audit has further reported that, as per the sanction letter issued by Union Bank of India dated October 
29, 2018, an industrial land and building located at 108, HPSIDC, Baddi, Himachal Pradesh – 173005, was to be 
mortgaged with the bank as prime security. However, the property has been alleged to have been sold by the 
Corporate Debtor to M/s AKJ Metals Private Limited, resulting in a total loss of ₹10.12 crores. 
(f) The forensic audit has also observed that despite regular purchases of Plant and Machinery aggregating to ₹6.60 
crores during FY 2017-18 to FY 2020-21, no value addition in turnover was noticed; instead, turnover reduced 
drastically by 96% (from ₹1,737.11 crores in FY 2017-18 to ₹70.80 crores in FY 2020-21). In the absence of 
satisfactory explanations or supporting documents, the forensic audit has opined that these substantial payments 
towards machinery purchases, and additional expenses of ₹77.42 lakhs bo oked under Repairs & Maintenance, 
indicate possible siphoning of funds by the Corporate Debtor.

(g) The forensic audit has further reported that the Corporate Debtor sold goods and job work services aggregating to 
₹13.88 crores during earlier periods to parties including M/s R N International (₹12.39 crores) and M/s H H Metals 
(₹1.49 crores) without real izing any consideration. Subsequently, such balances were written off in full in FY  
2021-22. The forensic audit has opined that these transactions were in the nature of fr aud, as stock was removed 
from the books by recording sales for which no money was received. 
(h) In addition to the above matters, the forensic audit report has also highlighted instances of fake sales and purchase 
transactions entered into by the Corporate Debtor, indicating further irregularities in the books of accounts. 
 
 
Our opinion is not modified in respect of these
 matters.

Pursuant to Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements ) Regulations, 2015, as 
amended 
 
Review Report To 
 
To The monitoring committee  
 RCI Industries and Technologies Limited 
 
 
1. Corporate Insolvency Proceeding as per Insolvency and bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC): 
 
The Application was filed by the Standard Chartered Bank (Singapore) Limited (Opera tional Creditor) under 
section 9 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (Code) fo r commencement of Corporate Insolvency 
Resolution Process (CIRP) in the matter of RCI I ndustries & Technologies Limited (“Corporate Debtor” or 
“Company”). Hon’ble National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) New Delhi vide its orde r dated November 25, 
2022 in C.P (IB) No. 2688 of 2019, commenced the CIRP in the m atter of Corporate Debtor and appointed Mr. 
Brijesh Singh Bhadauriya as Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) subsequently c onfirming him as the 
Resolution Professional ("RP") under the provisions of the Code. The said order was uploaded on the website and 
available to the RP on November 30, 2022. 
 
2. We have been informed by the Erstwhile Resolution Professional and chairman of the monitoring committee that 
the Directors, Statutory Auditors, and Compliance Officer of the Company were not cooperative in providing the 
desired information and documents promptly to the RP. Consequently, the RP was constrained to file an 
Intervention Application under Section 19(2) of the Insolvency and Bankr uptcy Code, 2016 before the Hon’ble 
National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) [IA No. 1396/2023 dated 03.03.2023], seeking necessary directions to 
the Directors, Statutory Auditors, and Compliance Officer of the Company to p rovide the required information 
and documents. The RP has further informed that despite such application; proper and complete data has still not 
been provided to the RP till date. 
 
3. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), New Delhi, vide its order dated 9 October 2025, approved the 
resolution plan submitted by JTL Industries Limited for the revival of the RCI Industries & Technologies Limited.

the Monitoring Committee constituted as per the approved resolution plan.  Accordingly, the financial results have 
been prepared on a going concern basis, considering the ongoing implem entation of the resolution plan and the 
expected revival of the Company. Management has evaluated the transaction as a non-adjusting subsequent event, 
and necessary disclosure has been made in the financial statements in accordance with the applicable accounting 
standards. 
 
4. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Unaudited Financial Results of RCI Industries 
& Technologies Limited (“the Parent”) and its subsidiaries (together referred to as “the Group”) for th e quarter 
ended June 30, 2025 (“the Statement”), which has been submitted by the Parent pursuant to the requirements of 
Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations , 2015, as amended 
(“Listing Regulations”). 
 
 
5. The Company’s Management is responsible for the preparation of the Statement in accordance with the 
recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standar d 34, (Ind AS 34) “Interim 
Financial Reporting” prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, as amended, read with r elevant 
rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with 
Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. The Statement has been approved by the monitoring committee. Our 
responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
 
6. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410, 
“Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity” issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This Standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain 
moderate assurance as to whether the Statement is free of material misstatement. A review of inter im financial 
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, 
and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in sco pe than an audit 
conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that 
we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit.  Accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion. 
 
7. We have not been provided with the financial statements of the parent’s subsidiaries and associates. Accordingly, 
the financial results of these subsidiaries and associates have not been included in the fin ancial results for this 
quarter.

8. Basis for Qualified Conclusion 
1. The Suspended Management did not provide Fixed Asset Register  as on the date of the commencement of 
the Insolvency proceedings on 25.11.2022 as was informed to us by the Resolution Professional during the 
CIRP. Major details such as cost of assets, accumulated depreciation of previous years, actual purchase dates, 
invoice numbers, vendor names, and appropriate descriptions of assets are not availab le in the depreciation 
chart provided to us. 
              Further, during our audit, we observed the following: 
• Significant discrepancies were noted in the depreciation chart, including non-availability of certain 
assets, existence of assets not recorded, mismatches in descriptions/models, absence of ass et tags, and 
weak internal controls. 
• As per the report of the independent Chartered Engineer appointed by the Erstwh ile Resolution 
Professional, certain items of Plant & Machinery were found to be idle, non-functional, redundant, and 
materially overstated. Further, the Chartered Engineer has also reported that vario us items of Plant & 
Machinery were missing as on the CIRP date. Also, machinery purchased from Dev i Metals was 
overstated by 40–50%, second-hand machinery by 40–50%, and new machinery by 30–35%. 
• Supporting documents such as invoices, purchase orders, and ownership proofs for major items of Plant 
& Machinery were not made available to us. Accordingly, we were unable to verify cap italization, 
ownership, and valuation of such assets. 
• Certain vehicles recorded in the books are registered in the names of third pa rties, raising doubt over 
the Parent Company’s ownership rights in respect of such assets. 
• Scrap and redundant assets were identified; however, no provision or write-off has b een recognized in 
the financial statements. 
• As per the Forensic Audit Report dated 16.08.2023, the Corporate Debtor had manipulated asset 
classification by routing transactions through accounts such as “Creation of Fixed Assets”  and 
“Creation of Assets”, thereby converting fixed assets into current assets and vice versa. These practices, 
carried out at periodic intervals, appear to have been adopted to manipulate financial ratios and facilitate 
submissions made to lenders against credit exposures. Such irregular accounting  treatment indicates 
potential misstatement of financial statements and non-compliance with applicable accounting 
standards.

• Because of the significance of the matters described above, we were unable to obtain s ufficient 
appropriate audit evidence to verify the existence, ownership, valuation, and co mpleteness of the 
balance of Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) and depreciation reported in t he financial statements. 
2. As per the report of the independent Chartered Engineer appointed by the Erstwhile Resolution Professional, 
certain items recorded under Capital Work-in-Progress (CWIP) in the books of account and the depreciation 
register provided by the erstwhile management were not physically available at the Plant as on  the date of 
commencement of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP). 
The financial impact of these discrepancies has not been quantified or recognized in th e accompanying 
financial statements. Accordingly, we were unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit eviden ce regarding 
the existence and valuation of CWIP as reported in the financial statements. 
3. The Parent Company holds equity investments in certain group companies. In acco rdance with Ind AS 109 
“Financial Instruments”, such investments are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss as 
at the balance sheet date and the resulting gain/loss should be recognized in the financial statements. However, 
no such fair valuation has been carried out by the management. due to no in formation being provided and 
shared by these group companies with Resolution Professional during the CIRP. 
Further, we have not been provided with agreements relating to these investments, nor have we been provided 
with the financial statements of the investee companies. In the absence of fair valuation and sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence, we are unable to determine the correctness of the carr ying value of these 
investments and the consequential impact on the financial statements, including the Statemen t of Profit and 
Loss and related disclosures. 
4. Parent Company faces a material uncertainty related to Going Concern because of  heavy losses incurred 
during the current and previous periods. Further, the net worth of the Parent Company has been fully eroded. 
These conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Parent 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. In our opinion, the financial statement however has been 
prepared by the management on a going concern basis for the reaso n as stated. Based on the information 
available, the Parent Company was admitted to Insolvency proceedings under section 9 of the Insolvency and 
Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (Code) and the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) in the matter of RCI 
Industries & Technologi es Limited (“Corporate Debtor” or “Company”) commenced with effect from 
25.11.2022 consequent upon Order of the Hon’ble National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) New Delhi vide

its order dated November 25, 2022 in C.P (IB) No. 2688 of 2019.  During the CIRP process, the resolution 
plan submitted by the JTL Industries Ltd. was approved by the Committee of Creditors (CoC) followed by 
the approval of the same by the Hon'ble NCLT vide its order dated 9.10.2 025. The said resolution plan for 
revival of the company is currently under implementation under the supervision of the Monitoring Committee 
constituted as per the approved resolution plan.  Accordingly, the financial results h ave been prepared on a 
going concern basis, considering the ongoing implementation of the resolution plan and the likelihood of rival 
as per the approval of a Resolution Plan, the financial statements of the Compan y have been prepared on a 
going concern basis. Accordingly, we conclude that the use of the goi ng concern assumption in the 
preparation of the accompanying financial statements is appropriate under the given circumstances. 
5. The Parent Company’s net worth has been fully eroded and it was under severe finan cial stress at the 
commencement of the CIRP on 25.11.2022. Based on the information and explanations given to us, and on 
the basis of financial ratios, ageing and expected realization of financial assets, payment schedules of financial 
liabilities, other information accompanying the financial statements, our knowledge of  the Board of 
Directors’/Erstwhile Resolution Professional and chairman of the monitoring committee plans, the provisions 
of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016, and our examination of the evidence supporting the 
assumption, all liabilities and claims, against the Company, which are not part of th e Resolution Plan, shall 
stand extinguished and no person will be entitled to initiate or continue any proceeding in respect to a claims 
which is not part of the resolution plan. All liabilities incurred during the CI RP period to keep the Company 
as a going concern, have been met as part of the CIRP Cost. Therefore, there does not exist any material 
uncertainty indicating that the Parent Company is not capable of meeting its liabilities ex isting as at the 
balance sheet date as and when they fall due within a period of one year from the balance sheet date. 
6. A Transaction-cum-Forensic Audit was carried out for the period April 01, 201 7 to November 25, 2022 (as 
the books of accounts for the period April 01, 2015 to March 3 1, 2017 have not been made available by the 
suspended director till date). The forensic auditor has reported preferential, u ndervalued, fraudulent, and 
extortionate transactions aggregating to ₹369.71 crores, covered under Sections 43 , 45, 50, and 66 of the 
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. Applications for reversal of these transactions have been filed before 
the Hon’ble National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). 
In view of the pending adjudication of these matters before the Hon’ble NCLT and ab sence of sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence regarding the recoverability and ultimate impact of such transactions on the 
financial statements, we are unable to comment on the adjustments, if any, that may b e required in the 
accompanying financial results.

7. We draw attention to the findings reported in the Forensic Audit carried out by an  independent forensic 
auditor appointed by the Erstwhile Resolution Professional and chairman of the monito ring committee. As 
per the forensic audit report, the Corporate Debtor had sold land situated at Nalagarh on 31st December 2019, 
originally purchased for ₹2.29 crores, to M/s AKJ Metals Private Limited for ₹2.30 cro res, resulting in a 
nominal gain of ₹1 lakh.  
The forensic auditor has observed that the fair market value of the said land, as per the Valuation Report dated 
15th May 2023, was ₹9.06 crores. Based on reverse calculation using the Cost of Inflation Index, the indexed 
cost was worked out at ₹7.52 crores, resulting in an imputed loss/fraud of approximately ₹5.22 crores, which 
has neither been recognized in the books of account nor appropriately disclosed in the financial statements.  
Further, it has been noted that during the period under review, there have b een no transactions involving 
related parties and entities having influence over the Corporate Debtor, indicating that the transaction may be 
prejudicial to the interests of the Company and its stakeholders. 
8. The Parent Company has received regulatory notices and summons from variou s government authorities, 
including the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO), Enforcement Directorate (ED), Directorate General 
of GST Intelligence (DGGST), and the Income Tax Department. Investigations by DGGST allege fraudulent 
availment of fake Input Tax Credit (ITC) amounting to approximately ₹214  crores through paper invoices, 
dummy companies, and other contrived arrangements, purportedly under th e direction of the erstwhile 
Managing Director.  
Pending conclusion of the said investigations and proceedings, the management/  Erstwhile Resolution 
Professional and chairman of the monitoring committee has not made any adjustm ents or disclosures of 
possible financial implications in the accompanying financial results. In the absence of sufficient appropriate 
audit evidence to evaluate the possible financial impact of such regulatory actions on the financial statements, 
we are unable to determine whether any adjustments are required to the carrying amounts of assets, liabilities, 
expenses and disclosures. 
The Parent Company has received notices and is subject to investigations by various agencies, including FIR 
No. 182/2022 registered by the Economic Offence Wing, New Delhi, and FIR No. 615/2023 registered by 
Police Station Madhav Nagar, Katni, M.P., in relation to allegations of fraud, misappropriatio n, and non-
return of job work material. These matters are presently under investigation.

Pending the outcome of such investigations and in the absence of sufficient  appropriate audit evidence, no 
adjustments have been made in the accompanying financial statements for any potential financial implications 
arising therefrom. Accordingly, we are unable to determine whether any adjustments are required to the 
carrying values of assets, liabilities, expenses, or disclosures. 
9. Parent Company borrowings were declared as non performing asset (NPA) during the year ended March 31, 
2020. All liabilities and claims, against the Company, which are not part of the Resolu tion Plan, shall stand 
extinguished and no person will be entitled to initiate or continue any proceeding in respect to a claim which 
is not part of the resolution plan. Due to this, we have not been provided with  any document confirming 
balances, as at June 30, 2025, for loans granted by financial institutions an d banks, BG Invocation liability 
towards banks, bill discounting liability towards banks, certain current accoun ts and fixed deposits held by 
the Company. In the absence of such document, we cannot comment on t he accuracy and completeness of 
these balances. The Company has not recognized interest expenses in its financial statement on its outstanding 
borrowings. 
 
10. The Parent Company has received multiple notices from the Income Tax Department, including: 
• Notice under Section 221(1)  dated July 31, 2025, from the Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax,  
Central Circle 32, Delhi, indicating substantial outstanding tax demands across several assessment years. 
The Company has been directed to show cause why penalty should not be levied for non-payment of these 
demands. 
• Notice under Section 148A(3)  dated June 28, 2025, for Assessment Year 2019 –20, wherein the Income 
Tax Department has alleged that the Company engaged in bogus sale-purchase transactions and claimed 
fraudulent Input Tax Credit (ITC)  amounting to ₹214.34 crores during FY 2017– 18 and FY 2018–19. 
The corresponding fake purchase transactions are estimated at ₹1,190.78 crores. The notice further states 
that the Company failed to provide substantive documentary evidence and that the transactions with various 
entities were found to be merely on paper, with no actual movement of good s. As a result, income 
aggregating to ₹915.00 crores is considered to have escaped assessment under Section 147 of the Act. 
The Parent Company has responded to the notices citing the moratorium under Section 14 of the Insolvency and 
Bankruptcy Code, 2016, due to its ongoing Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP). However, the tax 
authorities have rejected this contention and proceeded with reopening the assessment.

We also understand that the Income Tax Department has filed claim before the RP as per the IBC, 2016 in respect 
of their claim as on the CIRP commencement date for Rs. 79,37,03,360/- raised till 12.12.2022 upto the 
Assessment Year 2020-21 and the said claim would be dealt with as per the Resolutio n Plan to be approved by 
the Hon’ble NCLT in due course.  
In the absence of sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the resolution of these matters, the potential 
financial impact of penalties, tax liabilities, and adjustments arising from these proceedings  cannot be reliably 
estimated. Accordingly, we are unable to determine the consequential effect, if any , on the financial results for 
the quarter ended June 30, 2025. 
Based on our review conducted as above, except for the effects/possible effects of the matters specified in Para 6 
above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statem ent, prepared in 
accordance with the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standards and other accounting principles generally accepted in 
India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in term of  Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, including the man ner in which it is to be disclosed, 
or that it contains any material misstatement. 
 
In addition to the matters described above, we consider it necessary, in the in terest of stakeholders and public 
interest, to draw attention to certain significant issues, which have been included by u s in the Other Matter  
paragraphs below. 
 
9.  Other Matters: 
 
(a) The Parent Company has incurred continuous losses, its current liabilities exceed curren t assets, and it has 
defaulted in repayment of borrowings as well as in payment of certain regulatory  and statutory dues. These 
conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
(b) The accounts, however, have been prepared by the management on a going  concern basis, considering the 
reasons stated in the financial results and the approval of a resolution plan submitted by M/s JTL Industries, 
which was approved by the Committee of Creditors in followed by the 22nd Adjou rned meeting held 
approval of the Hon’ble NCLT on 05th June, 9.10.2025 and Voting concluded on 17 August 2024.

(c) In view of the ongoing implementation of the Resolution Plan post completion of  the Corporate Insolvency 
Resolution Process (CIRP) and various matters pending before regulatory authorities, the outcome of which 
cannot presently be ascertained, a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doub t on the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
(d) The forensic audit has reported that the Corporate Debtor has an outstanding balance with M/s Shilpi Cable 
Technologies Limited, amounting to ₹48.36 crores, pertaining to transactions of earlier years. As per external 
investigations, including those by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), M/s Shilpi Cable Technologies 
Limited and its promoters have been accused of allegedly cheating a consor tium of banks to the extent of 
₹1,000 crores, involving misuse of Letters of Credit, diversion of fun ds, and exc ess payments. The 
Company’s books of account reflect no sales to this party, though pa yments were received in earlier years 
and adjusted against London Metal Exchange (LME) differences. 
 
(e) The forensic audit has further reported that, as per the sanction letter issued b y Union Bank of India dated 
October 29, 2018, an industrial land and building located at 108, HPSIDC, Baddi, Himachal Pradesh – 
173005, was to be mortgaged with the bank as prime security. However, the pro perty has been alleged to 
have been sold by the Corporate Debtor to M/s AKJ Metals Private Limited, resulting in a total loss of ₹10.12 
crores. 
 
(f) The forensic audit has also observed that despite regular purchases of Plant and Mac hinery aggregating to 
₹6.60 crores during FY 2017-18 to FY 2020-21, no value addition in turnover was noticed; instead, turnover 
reduced drastically by 96% (from ₹1,737.11 crores in FY 2017-18 to ₹70.80 crores in FY 2020 -21). In the 
absence of satisfactory explanations or supporting documents, the forens ic audit has opined that these 
substantial payments towards machinery purchases, and additional expenses of ₹77. 42 lakhs bo oked under 
Repairs & Maintenance, indicate possible siphoning of funds by the Corporate Debtor. 
 
(g) The forensic audit has further reported that the Corporate Debtor sold good s and job work services 
aggregating to ₹13.88 crores during earlier periods to parties including M/s R N International (₹12.39 crores) 
and M/s H H Metals (₹1.49 crores) without real izing any consideration. Subsequently, such balances were 
written off in full in FY 2021-22. The forensic audit has opined that these transactions  were in the nature of 
fraud, as stock was removed from the books by recording sales for which no money was received.
