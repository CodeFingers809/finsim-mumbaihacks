Independent Auditors Review report on Standalone Unaudited Quarterly Financial Results of the 
Company pursuant to Regulations 33 & 52 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) 
TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF 
Inox Green Energy Services Limited 
(Formerly known as Inox Wind Infrastructure Service Limited) 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of unaudited standalone financial results of Inox 
Green Energy Services Limited ("the Company") for the quarter and half yedr ended September 
30, 2025 ("the Statement"), being submitted by the company pursuant to the requirement of 
Regulation 33 & 52 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015 (as amended). 
2. The Company's hlanagenient is responsible for the preparation of the Statement in accordance 
with the recognition and measurement principles ldid down in Indian Accounting Standard 35, 
(Ind AS 34) "Interim Financial Reporting" prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 
2013 as amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. The 
Statement has been approved by the Company's Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to 
express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 - "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity", issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This 
standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether 
the statements are free of material misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of 
company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data. A review is substantially 
less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently 
does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that 
might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the accompanying statement of unaudited standalone financial results prepared in 
accordance with applicable accounting stdndards and other recognized accounting practices and 
policies has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the 
SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 includirig the manner 
in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any materiafniisstatement.

express an audit opinion.

applicable.

share of total net profit after tax of Rs. 0.22 Lakh for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, as
