Sir/ Ma’am, 
Subject : Clarification on Spurt in Volume 
Sir / Madam, 
With reference to Stock Exchanges email dated 13.11.2025 & 14.11.2025, 
seeking clarification regarding any information or announcement that may have a 
bearing on the price or volume behaviour of the Company’s scrip. In this regard, we 
would like to inform you that, as on date, there is no pending information or 
announcement required to be disclosed to the stock exchanges in terms of the 
Materiality Policy framed by the Company under Regulation 30 of the SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“Listing Regulations”). 
It is further submitted that the Company has always made timely and appropriate 
disclosures under Regulation 30 of the Listing Regulations, in accordance with the 
Materiality Policy and the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. 
We further confirm that as on date, there is no material information, event, or 
announcement that requires disclosure under the said Regulations which has not 
already been made public by the Company. The movement in the price/volume of the 
Company’s securities appears to be purely market-driven and not attributable to any 
unpublished price sensitive information. 
You are requested to kindly take the above on record. 
Thanking you, 
For Hemisphere Properties India Limited 
Lubna 
Company Secretary & Compliance officer
