o 6% YoY growth in IP volume (adjusted for seasonality and exit from scheme business 
in Aster Aadhar) reflects higher contribution from CONGO mix. 
o Excluding scheme and seasonality, ARPP IP grew by 11% YoY driven by higher 
contributions from high-value procedures, mainly in Oncology and Neurosciences
o Aster Whitefield revenue grew by 27% YoY in Q2FY26. 
▪ Operating EBITDA grew by 6% YoY (15% QoQ) despite higher material costs on account of 
growth in medical oncology services.
