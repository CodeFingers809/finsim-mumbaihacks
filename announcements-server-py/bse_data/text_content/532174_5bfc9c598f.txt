Detailed Rationale
Crisil Ratings has reaffirmed its ‘Crisil AAA/Crisil AA+*/Stable’ ratings on the debt instruments of ICICI Bank Ltd (ICICI
Bank).
 
Crisil Ratings has also withdrawn its rating on Tier I bonds (Under Basel III) of Rs 1,140 crore (See ‘Annexure - Details of
Rating Withdrawn' for details) in line with its withdrawal policy. Crisil Ratings has received independent verification that these
instruments are fully redeemed.
 
The ratings continue to reflect the bank’s healthy capitalization, strong market position, comfortable resource profile and
stable asset quality.
 
On September 30, 2025, the bank had gross advances and deposits of Rs 14.3 lakh crore and Rs 16.1 lakh crore,
respectively, on a standalone basis and remains among the three domestic systemically-important banks (D-SIBs), as
classified by RBI. On the same date, the bank’s reported networth was Rs 3.1 lakh crore (standalone) and Rs 3.4 lakh crore
(consolidated, excluding minority interest) whereas overall capital adequacy ratio (CAR, standalone) was 15.8% (excluding
H1FY26 profit). 
 
Asset quality has also improved over the years and remained stable with gross and net non-performing assets (GNPAs and
NNPAs) of 1.6% and 0.4%, respectively, as on September 30, 2025. The bank’s ability to maintain this metric at sound
levels, alongside sustained growth, will remain a key monitorable. 
 
Lastly, profitability remained stable with a consolidated net profit of Rs 26,915 crore for half year ended September 30, 2025
as compared to Rs 24,644 crore for the corresponding period of the previous fiscal.
 
*Crisil AA+ for Tier-I bonds
Analytical Approach
Crisil Ratings has combined the business and financial risk profiles of ICICI Bank and its subsidiaries because of majority
shareholding, business and financial linkages and shared brand.
 
Please refer Annexure - List of Entities Consolidated, which captures the list of entities considered and their analytical treatment of consolidation.
Key Rating Drivers & Detailed Description
Healthy capitalisation
Networth was sizeable at Rs 3.1 lakh crore while Tier I capital adequacy ratio (CAR) was 15.1% and overall CAR was
15.8% (excluding H1FY26 profit), as on September 30, 2025, substantiating the bank’s healthy capital position. In fiscal
2021, the bank raised equity capital of Rs 15,000 crore under QIP (qualified institutional placement) to further strengthen its
capital position. Consequently, networth coverage for net NPAs (non-performing assets) was strong at 53.4 times as on
September 30, 2025 (11.5 times as on March 31, 2020).
 
Moreover, the bank has adequate flexibility to raise resources through sale of stake in subsidiaries (more than Rs 16,000
crore raised in the past few fiscals). Backed by healthy cash accrual and demonstrated ability to raise capital, the bank is
likely to maintain strong capitalization to support overall credit risk profile and adequately cover for asset-side risks while
pursuing credit growth over the medium term.
 
Strong market position
ICICI Bank remains among the largest private sector banks in India with consolidated asset base of Rs 26.9 lakh crore as
on September 30, 2025 (standalone asset base of Rs 21.4 lakh crore). With gross advances and deposits of Rs 14.3 lakh
crore and Rs 16.1 lakh crore, respectively, as on September 30, 2025, on standalone basis, it is also one of the three banks
that has been classified as domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) by RBI, highlighting its significance to the overall
financial system.
 
Across various businesses within ICICI group, size, scale and positioning have been key strengths. As a leading full-service
universal banking group with pan-India footprint, the group has strong presence in life and general insurance, asset
management, private equity and retail broking. Wide geographical spread is reflected in its network of 7,246 branches as on
September 30, 2025.
 
The bank’s established market position shall continue to benefit from its strategy of expanding penetration and coverage in
the domestic lending space, particularly in retail lending, while maintaining strong liability franchise.
 
Comfortable resource profile
In the scheme of growth, the bank’s resource franchise has also remained comfortable - supported by high proportion of
low-cost current account and savings account (CASA) deposits. On September 30, 2025, the bank reported a total deposit
base of Rs 16.1 lakh crore, which marks a modest year-on-year growth of 7.7% over September 2024. As a proportion of
total deposits, CASA remained healthy at 40.9% as on September 30, 2025, as against 40.6% as on September 30, 2024.
Adjacently, the cost of deposits reduced to 4.6% for Q2 2026 vis-à-vis 4.9% for Q1 2026 and 4.9% for full fiscal 2025 on
account of recent policy repo rate cut announced by the monetary policy committee. Furthermore, retail deposits form a
significant part of the total deposits and provide stability to the resource profile.
 
Wide branch network and strong focus on digital banking shall help maintain higher-than-industry-average CASA levels and
competitive funding cost over the medium term.
 
Stable asset quality
Asset quality of the bank has witnessed gradual improvement over the past few years and, remained stable with a GNPA
(as a percentage of gross advances) of 1.6% as on September 30, 2025, having improved from 2.0% on September 30,
2024. This traction was demonstrated across most asset segments. Contrary to the past - where high delinquencies in the
corporate loan portfolio constrained the overall asset quality, slippage within this portfolio have subsided. With regards to the
retail and SME (small and medium enterprises) segments, while delinquencies have normalized from previous low levels,
the overall slippage to NPAs have remained range bound.
 
Gross NPAs (as a percentage of gross advances) in the retail (including rural) segments, improved marginally to 1.5% as on
September 30, 2025, from 1.6% as on September 30, 2024. Provision coverage ratio (excluding technical write-offs) was
also comfortable at 75.6% on this date (79.0% as on September 30, 2024) resulting in net non-performing assets (NNPA) of
0.4% on the same date.
 
The bank has demonstrated resilience in the past while tiding over asset quality pressures across cycles by putting in place
an institutionalized risk assessment framework involving enhanced control and monitoring mechanisms. Apart from this,
various schemes launched by the Government of India and the RBI, such as the emergency credit line guarantee scheme
that has benefitted the micro, small and medium enterprises, have also aided asset quality. The one-time restructuring
scheme has also benefited the reported NPA metrics.
 
Moreover, the bank’s strategy of increasing the proportion of retail (including rural loans) assets, which stood at ~58% of
overall net advances as on September 30, 2025, is expected to granularize the loan book further and support asset quality.
Crisil Ratings will continue to monitor the sustenance in asset quality at sound levels, alongside growth in advances.
Liquidity Superior
Liquidity continues to be supported by a strong retail deposit base that forms a significant part of the total deposits. As on
September 30, 2025, liquidity coverage ratio was 125% (on consolidated basis). Liquidity also benefits from access to
systemic sources of funds such as the liquidity adjustment facility from the RBI, access to the call money market and the
refinance limits from National Housing Bank and National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development.
ESG Profile
Crisil Ratings believes the environment, social and governance (ESG) profile of ICICI Bank supports its already strong credit
risk profile.
 
The ESG profile for financial sector entities typically factors in governance as a key differentiator. The sector has a
reasonable social impact because of its substantial employee and customer base and can play a key role in promoting
financial inclusion. While the sector does not have a direct adverse environmental impact, lending decisions may have a
bearing on the environment.
 
ICICI Bank has an ongoing focus on strengthening the various aspects of its ESG profile.

ICICI Bank has an ongoing focus on strengthening the various aspects of its ESG profile.
Key ESG highlights of ICICI Bank:
In fiscal 2025, the bank increased outstanding portfolio to sectors such as renewable energy, electric vehicles, green
certified real estate, waste management, water sanitation, positive impact sectors including small-scale khadi,
handicrafts and lending to weaker section under RBI’s priority sector norms to Rs 90,600 crore (of this, 34.2% was
deployed towards green finance portfolio) as on March 31, 2025 as compared to Rs 68,528 crore (of this, 28.3% was
deployed towards green finance portfolio) a year ago. This increase is a result of bank’s adoption of framework for
sustainable financing, aligning with India’s sovereign green bond framework and the banks continued efforts to embed
sustainable financing in its business strategy. Of the green finance portfolio, 55% was deployed towards renewable
energy and allied activities.
The share of renewable energy in the bank’s total electric consumption (from grid and solar generation) stood at 33% in
FY2025. Also, 5 million square feet of the bank's premises are IGBC certified.
Of the total workforce, around 32% comprised of women as on March 31, 2025. The bank’s initiatives such as lending to
Self-Help Groups (SHG), have benefited 11 million women through 9.8 lakh loans. Of these, over 3.33 lakh were first-
time women borrowers.
Majority of the board members are independent directors and chairperson, and executive positions are segregated. The
bank has a dedicated investor grievance redressal mechanism and the disclosures put out by it are extensive. ESG
governance includes an ESG Steering Committee, quarterly reviews, semi-annual reporting to the risk committee and
annual updates to the board.
The bank aims for carbon neutrality in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by FY2032. Furthermore, during FY2025, the bank
supported numerous CSR initiatives, including water conservation projects, afforestation, and biodiversity enhancement,
impacting over 10 million beneficiaries.
Outlook Stable
ICICI Bank will maintain its strong market position, healthy capitalisation and comfortable resource profile over the medium
term.

Any other information
ICICI Bank, on standalone basis, reported annualised return on assets of 2.4% (annualized) for the half ended September
30, 2025, against 2.4% in the corresponding period of previous fiscal. Profitability, after remaining impacted in fiscal 2021
due to additional pandemic-related provisioning requirement (Rs 4,750 crore), has improved thereafter with controlled credit
cost resulting in net profits increasing to Rs 47,227 crore in fiscal 2025 from Rs 40,888 crore previous year. Provision
coverage ratio (excluding technical write-offs) stood at 75.6% as on September 30, 2025 (79.0% as on September 30,
2024).
 
The factors that could trigger a default event for non-equity tier I capital instruments (under Basel III) resulting in non-
payment of coupon are: i) the bank exercising coupon discretion; ii) inadequacy of eligible reserves to honour coupon
payment if the bank reports losses or low profits; or iii) the bank breaching the minimum regulatory CET I (including CCB)
ratio. Moreover, given the additional risk attributes, the rating transition for non-equity tier I capital instruments (under Basel
III) can potentially be higher and faster than that for tier II instruments.
 
Key features of ICICI Bank's Rs 3,360 crore tier I bond issue (under Basel III) 
                 The bonds are non-convertible, perpetual, unsecured and Basel III-compliant
                 Coupon payments shall be annual and non-cumulative
                 The bank has full discretion at all times to cancel coupon payments
             The coupons must be paid out of distributable items. In this context, coupon may be paid out of current fiscal profits.
However, if current fiscal profits are not sufficient, coupon may be paid subject to availability of sufficient eligible reserves
(subject to the bank meeting minimum regulatory requirements for CET I, tier I, and total capital ratios at all times as
prescribed by the RBI) or credit balance in profit and loss account, if any
              Dividend stopper clause as defined in the guidelines is applicable
              Loss-absorption features as per the RBI Basel III norms are applicable
             Instrument will be temporarily written down upon CET I breaching the pre-specified trigger of 5.5% before March 31,
2019, and 6.125% on or after March 31, 2019
            The instrument may be permanently written off at the option of RBI on occurrence of point of non-viability (PONV)
trigger. The PONV trigger shall be determined by the RBI
 
Annexure: Note on tier-I instruments (under Basel III)
The distinguishing features of non-equity tier I capital instruments (under Basel III) are the existence of coupon discretion at
all times, high capital thresholds for likely coupon non-payment and principal write-down (on breach of a pre-specified
trigger). These features increase the risk attributes of non-equity tier I instruments over those of tier II instruments under
Basel III and capital instruments under Basel II. To factor in these risks, Crisil Ratings notches down the ratings on these
instruments from the bank's corporate credit rating. The rating on ICICI Bank's tier I bonds (under Basel III) has, therefore,
been lowered by one notch from its corporate credit rating to 'Crisil AA+/Stable’, in line with the Crisil Ratings criteria (refer
to the Crisil Ratings rating criteria for Basel III compliant instruments of banks).
