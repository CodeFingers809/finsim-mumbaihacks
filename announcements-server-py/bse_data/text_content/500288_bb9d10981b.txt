INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REVIEW REPORT ON REVIEW OF INTERIM 
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS 
TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF MOREPEN LABO RA TORIES LIMITED 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of consolidated financial results of Morepen 
Laboratories Limited (the "Parent") and its subsidiaries (the Parent and its subsidiaries together 
referred to as the ("Group") for the quarter ended Sept 30, 2025 (the "Statement"), being submitted 
by the Parent pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulat ions, 2015, as amended (the "Listing Regulations"). 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Parent's management and approved by the Parent's 
Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement 
principles laid down in Indian Accounting Stan da rd 34, (Ind AS 34) "Interim Financial Reporting" 
prescribed under Sect ion 133 of the Companies Act , 20 13 as amended , read with relevant rules 
issued thereunder and other accounting princi p !es generally accepted in India . Our responsi bi Ii ty is 
to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our rev iew. 
3. We conducted our review of the State ment in accordance with the Standard on Review Engageme nts 
(SRE) 2410 "Review oflnterim Financ ial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the 
Entity" issued by the Institute of Cha1iered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we 
plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the Statement is free of 
material misstatement. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, 
primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and app lying analytical and 
other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in 
accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enab le us to obtain assurance 
that we wou ld becom e aware of all significa nt matters that might be identified in an audit. 
Accordingly , we do not express an audit opinion. 
We also performed procedures in accordance with the circular issued by the SEBI under Regulation 
33 (8) of the SEBI (Listin g Obligations and Disclo sure Requirements) Regulation s, 2015, as 
amended , to the extent applicable . 
4. This Statement includes the results of the following Group entities:

e) Total Care Limited 
f) Morepen Devices Limited 
g) Quick Med Private Limited 
Foreign Subsidiaries: 
a) Morepen Bio Inc., USA 
b) Morepen Labs FZCO, UAE 
Fu1iher, on 31 s1 July 2025, the Company's shareholding in Dr. Morepen Limited has come down to 
19.96 % from earlier 80%, resulting in loss of control. Accordingly, Dr. Morepen Limited has ceased 
to be a subsidiary and will be accounted for as an investment in subsequent periods. Accordingly, 
Dr. Morepen Limited and its step-down subsidiaries, Total Care Limited and Quick Med Private 
Limited, have been included in the conso lidated financia l results only up to July 31, 2025. 
5. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 as above, nothing 
has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in 
accordance with the recognition and measurement princip les laid down in the aforesaid Indian 
Accounting Standards ("Ind AS") specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 as 
amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regu lation 
33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended 
(the "L isting Regulations") , including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains 
any material misstatement. 
6. We did not review the interim financial results of four subsid iaries i.e. Morepen Devices Limited, 
Morepen Rx Ltd., Morepen Bio Inc. and Morepen Labs FZCO., included in the statement, whose 
interim financial resu lts for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025 respectively reflect 
total revenues (before conso lidation adjustments) of Rs. 5085.22 lakhs and Rs. 7432. 14 lakhs, total 
profit/(loss) after tax (before conso lidation adjustments) of Rs. 112.41 lakhs and Rs.118.14 lakhs 
and total comprehensive income (before consolidation adjustments) of Rs. 95.40 lakhs and 
Rs.101.58 lakhs. 
Further, we did not review the interim financial results of Dr. Morepen Limited, Total Care Limited, 
and Quickmed Private Limited for the month of July 25, included in the statement, whose interim 
financial results, reflects total revenues (before consolidation adjustments) of Rs. 1946.30 lakhs, 
total profit/(loss) after tax (before conso lidation adjustments) of Rs. 64.81 lakhs and total 
comprehensive income (before consolidation adjustments) of Rs. 63.03 lakhs for the month of July 
2025, as these entities ceased to be subsid iaries of the Parent subsequent to that date. 
The interim financial results of the Indian subsidiaries have been reviewed by their auditors whose 
report has been furnished to us by the Parent 's management and our conclusion on the Statement, 
in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries, is based 
solely on the report of the other auditors and the procedures performed by us as stated in paragraph

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REVIEW REPORT ON REVIEW OF INTERIM 
STANDALONE FINANCIAL RESULTS 
TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF MOREPEN LABORATORIES LIMITED 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of standalone financial results of Morepen 
Laboratories Limited (the "Company") for the quarter ended Sept 30, 2025 (the "Statement"), 
being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (the "L isting 
Regulations") , 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's management and approved by the 
Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, (Ind AS 34) "Interim 
Financial Reporting" prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 as amended, 
read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in 
India and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (the "Listing Regulations") . Our responsibility is 
to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to 
whether the Statement is free of material misstatement. A review of interim financial 
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and 
accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing 
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all 
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit 
op1111on. 
4. Based on our review conducted as stated in paragraph 3 above, nothing has come to our attention 
that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement of unaudited standalone financial 
results prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the 
aforesaid Indian Accounting Standards ("Ind AS") specified under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 as amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to 
be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligat ions and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations , 2015, as amended (the "Listing Regulations "), including the manner 
in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
