Limited Review Report on Standalone Unaudited Financial Results of Reliance 
Communications Limited for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025 pursuant to 
Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63(2) of the SEBJ (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 as amended 
To Board of Directors I Resolution Professional (RJ') of Reliance Communications Limited 
I. The Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal, Mumbai Bench ("NCLT") admitted an insolvency 
and bankruptcy petition filed by an operational creditor against Reliance Communications Limited 
("the Company") and appointed Resolution Professional (RP) who has been vested with management 
of affairs and powers of the Board of Directors with direction to initiate appropriate action 
contemplated with extant provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 and other related 
rules. 
2. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of standalone unaudited financial results of the 
Company for the quarter and half year ended September JO, 2025 ('the Statement') attached 
herewith, being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 and 
Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63(2) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 as amended ("Listing Regulations"). 
3. This Statement is the responsibility of the Company's Management and has been approved by 
the Board of Directors of the Company and taken on record by the RP in their meeting held on 
November 14, 2025, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement 
principles laid down in Jnd AS 34 "fnterim Financial Reporting" prescribed under section 133 of 
the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act") and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. 
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
4. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 'Review of Interim Pinancial Information Performed by the 
I ndependcnt Auditor of the Entity' issued by the r nstitute of Chartered Accountants of India. This 
Standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to 
whether the Statement is free of material misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries 
of the Company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus provides 
less assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do not express 
an audit opinion. 
5. We draw attention to Note no. 4 & 6 of the Statement, "Assets Held for Sale (AHS)" including 
Wireless Spectrum, Towers, Fibre and Media Convergence Nodes (MCNs) along with liabilities 
continues to be classified as held for sale at the val uc ascertained at the end of March 31, 2018, for 
the reasons referred to in the aforesaid note and impact of the non payment of spectrum installments 
due to Department of Telecommunication (DOT). Non determination of fair value of Asset 1-leld for 
Sale as on the reporting date is not in compliance with Ind AS 105 "Non Current Assets Held for 
Sale and Discontinued Operations". Accordingly, wc arc unable to comment on the consequentia l 
impact, if any, on the carrying amounl of Assets Held for Sale and on the reported losses for the 
qua11er and half year ended September 30, 2025 .

6. We draw attention to Note no. 5 of the Stalement regarding admission of the Company and its two 
subsidiaries into Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process ("CIRP") and pending determination of 
obligations and liabilities with regard to various claims submitted by the Operational/financial/other 
creditors and employees including interest payable on loans during ClRP. We are unable to 
comment the accounting impact there of pending reconciliation and determination of final 
obligation. The Company accordingly has not provided interest on borrowings amounting to 
Rs.1,462 crorc and Rs. 2,625 crore for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025 
respectively and Rs. 33,478 crore up to the previous financial year calculated based on basic rate of 
interest as per terms of loan. The Company rurther has not provided for foreign exchange (gain)/ 
loss amounting to Rs. 612 crore and Rs. 669 crore for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 
2025 respectively and Rs. 4,095 crore of foreign exchange loss up to lhe previous financial year. 
Had such interest and foreign exchange variation (gain)/ loss as mentioned above been provided, the 
reported loss for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025 would have been higher by 
Rs.2,074 crore and Rs. 3,294 crore respectively and Netwo1th as on September 30, 2025 and March 
31, 2025 would have been lower by Rs. 40,867 crore and Rs. 37,573 crore respectively. Non 
provision of interest and non-recognition of foreign exchange variation (gain)/ Joss is not in 
compliance with Ind AS 23 "Borrowing Costs" and Ind AS 21 "The Effects of Changes in Foreign 
Exchange Rates" respectively. 
7. We draw attention to Note no. 4 & 17 of the Statement, regarding pending comprehensive review of 
carrying amount of all assets (including investments, receivables and balances lying under Goods 
and Service Tax) & liabilities and non-provision for impairment of carrying value of the assets and 
write back of liabilities if any, pending completion of the CIRP and various irregularities reported 
by the forensic auditor M/s BDO India LLP, appointed by one of the lenders, in their forensic 
audit report for the period from April 01, 2013 to March 31, 2017 as communicated by ce1tain 
banks and communication received from certain banks with respect to willful defaulter and fraud. In 
the absence of comprehensive review as mentioned above for the carrying value of all the assets and 
liabilities and unable to determine of potential impact of communications from banks in respect of 
willful default / fraud, we are unable to comment that whether any adjustment is required in the 
carrying amount of such assets and liabilities and consequential impact, if any, on the repor ted losses 
for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025. Non determination of fair value of financial 
assets & liabilities and impairment of carrying amount for other assets and liabilities arc not in 
compliance with lnd AS 109 "Financial Instruments", Ind AS 36 "Impairment of Assets" and Ind AS 
37 "Provisions, Contingent Liabilities & Contingent Assets''. 
8. We draw attention to Note no. 19 of the Statement, wherein during the earlier year, erstwhile 
director of Bonn Investment Inc. ("Bonn") had sold its property for an amount of USD 8.34 
million (approx. Rs.69.55 Crore) and invested the same with AZCO Real Estate Brokers LLC 
("AZCO") without the authorisation / permission of the Management and Resolution 
Professional (RP) of the Company. As explained in detail in the aforesaid note , the Management 
of Bonn has taken certain steps and will take all necessary steps as required to be undertaken 
including recovery of the advance given to AZCO. The Management of Bonn is hopeful that the 
steps taken and discussion with AZCO will result in recovering the said advance and 
accordingly, no provision has been made in the financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 
2025 against the said advance. Also, the Company has filed a petition against the erstwhile 
Director of the Company based on the digital analysis report for his involvement in the afo~ «!~s§,, 
!ransactions. Further, the financial results/statements of Bonn for the quarter ended S(7,Af§piber,~~~ 
30, 2025, for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, for the year ended March 31, 2025 and ~ h 3 1. \~,

Based on the matters fully described in the aforesaid note, we are unable to determine on the 
potential impact if any in the unaudited financial results/statements of Bonn in relation to 
unauthorised sale made by the erstwhile director of Bonn and involvement of erstwhile director 
of RCOM if any on the said transactions. 
9. We draw attention to Note no. 21 ofthe Statement regarding searches carried out by Directorate 
of Enforcement (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) at the premises of Reliance 
Communications Limited during the quarter ended September 30, 2025, based on FIRs 
registered with CBI. Further, certain properties of the subsidiary Companies have also been 
provisionally aUached in terms of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 by ED. As stated 
by the Management, the actions taken by the agencies may adversely affect the value of 
investments of the Company, however no adjustment has been carried out in the books of 
account. Based on the matters stated in aforesaid note, we are unable to determine the potential 
impact if any, in respect of the pending investigation and provisional attachment by the 
regulatory agencies that may be required in the standalone financial results for the quarter and 
half year ended September 30, 2025. 
10. We draw attention to Note no. 12 of the Statement, regarding non adoption ofJnd AS l l 6 "Leases" 
effective from April 01, 2019 and the consequent impact thereof. The aforesaid accounting treatment 
is not in accordance with the relevant Indian Accounting Standard Ind AS 116. 
11. We draw attention to Note no. 4 of the Statement, regarding continuous losses incurred by the 
Company, current liabilities exceeding its current assets, default in repayment of borrowings and 
default in payment of regulatory and statutory dues and pending application of renewal of Telecom 
License and pending application of renewal of Telecom Licenses and potential impact of the matters 
stated in note no 17 and 2 l. These situation indicates that a material uncertainty exists that may cast 
significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accounts however 
have been prepared by the management on a going concern basis for the reason stated in the 
aforesaid note. We however are unable lo obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding 
management's use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the standalone 
financial results, in view of ongoing CIRP and matters pending before regulatory authorities , the 
outcome of which cannot be presently ascertained. 
12. Based on our review conducted as above, except for the matters described in paragraphs 5 to 11 
above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying 
Statement of standalone unaudited financial results prepared in accordance with applicable 
Accounting Standards i.e. Indian Accounting Standards ('Ind AS') prescribed under Section 133 
of the Act read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other recognized accounting practices 
and policies has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 
and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63(2) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 as amended including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, 
or that it contains any material misstatement.

13. We draw· attention to Note no. 8 of the Statement, regarding provision of license fee and spectrum 
usage charges based on management estimates pending special audit from Department of 
Telecommunications, pursuant to the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, vide its order 
dated October 24, 2019 and status of payment thereof which may undergo revision based on any 
development in the said matter. Our conclusion on the Statement is not modified in respect of this 
matter. 
14. Pursuant to applications filed by Ericsson India Pvt. Ltd. before the National Company Law 
Tribunal, Mumbai Bench ("NCLT'') in terms of Section 9 of the Insolvency and Bank ruptcy Code, 
20 J 6 read with the rules and regulations framed thereunder ("Code"), the NCLT had admitted the 
applications and ordered the commencement of corporate insolvency resolution process ("CIRP") of 
Reliance Communication Limited ("the Company") and two of its subsidiaries namely Reliance 
lnfratel Limited (RJTL, ceased w.e.f December 22, 2022) and Reliance Telecom Limited (RTL) 
(collectively, the "Corporate Debtors") vide its orders dated May 15, 2018. The committee of 
creditors ("CoC") of the Corporate Debtors, at the meetings of the CoC held on May 30, 2019, in 
terms of Section 22 (2) of the Code, resolved with the requisite voting share, to replace the Interim 
Resolution Professionals with the Resolution Professional ("RP") for the Corporate Debtors, which 
has been confirmed by the NCLT in its orders dated June 21, 2019 (published on the website of the 
NCL Ton June 28, 2019). 
15. As per Regulation 33 and 52 of the Listing Regulations, the standalone unaudited financial results of 
the Company submitted to the stock exchange shall be signed by the Chairperson or Managing 
Director or Whole Time Director or in absence of all of them, it shall be signed by any Director of 
the Company who is duly authorized by the Board of Directors to sign the standalone unaudited 
financial results. As mentioned in Note No 1 of the Statement, in view of the ongoing CIRP, the 
powers of the board of directors stand suspended and are exercised by the Resolution Professional.

migration applications ("DoT Letter"). On June 25, 2021, the Corporate Debtor has issued a 
letter to DoT clarifying that the various categories of dues stipulated by the DoT are not in the 
nature of the "current dues" and are to be resolved within the framework of the Code (being 
dues that pertain to the period prior to May 7, 2019) and/ or are not payable at present, and 
requesting that making payments against the said dues should not be mandated as a pre­
condition for further processing of the migration applications filed by the Corporate Debtor. 
In light of the urgency of the matter, the RP had filed an application before the NCL T in both 
RCOM and RTL praying that the DoT inter alia be restrained from taking any action which may 
interfere with the continued holding of the telecom spectrum of the Corporate Debtor. The 
NCLT had adjourned the matter following which the RP had thereafter filed a writ petition in the 
Delhi High Court seeking issuance of an appropriate writ, order or direction in the nature of 
mandamus directing the DoT to migrate the telecom licenses to UL without the insistence on 
the payment of the dues set out in DoT Letter. The Delhi High Court, on July 19, 2021, passed 
an interim order that "till the next date, the respondent is directed to not take any coercive 
action against the petitioner for withdrawal of the telecom spectrum granted to the petitioner in 
respect of 18 service areas, as also to permit the petitioner to continue providing telecom 
services in the 18 se,vice areas which are subject matters of the present petition." On July 20, 
2021, the writ petition hearing concluded and order was passed by the Delhi High Court

NCL T has, as an interim measure, extended the ad interim protection granted by the Delhi 
High Court until the next date of hearing. Further, on August 12, 2021, the NCLT has directed 
that the interim orders shall continue until the next date of hearing. The issue under 
consideration by the NCLT relates to whether the dues being claimed by DoT in its letter of 
June 15, 2021 for the purposes of processing the license renewal/ migration applications of the 
Corporate Debtor are in the nature of "current dues" (within the meaning of the Explanation to 
Section 14(1) of the Code) and therefore, payable during the CIRP period. The application was 
listed on various occasions before the NCL T; however effective hearing did not take place due 
to paucity of time. Matter was last listed on October 14, 2025 and the next date of hearing is on 
December 09, 2025.

2016 issued by the DoT, not prescribing pre-condition for any payment to be made prior to the 
migration of the telecom licenses. The TDSAT, on September 23, 2021, has directed that" The 
interim arrangement shall be considered further after receipt of the order of NCL T However, 
till then let the status quo be maintained in terms of initial order of Delhi High Court passed on 
19.7.2021 which has continued thereafter by further order of the High Court followed by orders 
of NCL T" On March 15, 2022, the TDSAT granted time for filing rejoinder and continued the

of UASL to UL wherein the DoT has sought for payment of certain dues as "current dues" 
(being dues that pertain to the period prior to May 7, 2019 and are not payable at present) as a 
pre-condition for consideration of the application. The RP has filed an application in the NCL T 
and a petition before the TDSAT bearing T.P. No. 39 of 2021 in this regard (which matters are 
heard together with the RCOM license migration matters). On September 23, 2021, the 
TDSAT has directed that "Since the matters are similar in nature, in the interest of justice and 
uniformity the interim order of status quo as operating in TP No. 31 of 2021 shall operate in 
this matter also till the next date. It will be in the interest of petitioner to expedite the 
proceeding pending before the NCL T and try its best to produce the orders passed by that 
Tribunal by the next date." On March 15, 2022, the DoT had been granted 6 weeks' time by 
TDSAT to file the reply, and rejoinder was to be filed before the next date of hearing, The 
TDSAT further directed that the interim order passed by the TDSAT vide order dated 
September 23, 2021 shall stand continuing to be operative during the pendency of the

Considering these developments including, in particular, the RP having taken over the 
management and control of the Corporate Debtor and its subsidiaries. i.e. RTL and RCIL (with 
RCIL presently being under the management and control of the monitoring committee 
constituted in terms of its resolution plan which was approved by the NCLT on December 19, 
2023 and the resolution plan implementation being still pending) ("Company") inter alia with 
the objective of running them as going concerns, the Standalone financial results continue to 
be prepared on going concern basis. Since the Company continues to incur losses, current 
liabilities exceed current assets and Company has defaulted in repayment of borrowings, 
payment of regulatory and statutory dues and pending renewal of telecom licenses, these 
events indicate that material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on Company's 
ability to continue as a going concern. The Auditors have drawn qualification in their Limited 
review report for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025. 
5. Considering various factors including admission of the Corporate Debtor and its subsidiaries: 
RTL and RCIL to CIRP under the Code, there are various claims submitted by the operational 
creditors, the financial creditors, employees and other creditors. The overall obligations and 
liabilities including obligation for interest on loans and the principal rupee amount in respect of 
loans including foreign currency denominated loans shall be determined during the CIRP and 
accounting impact, if any, will be given on completion of CIRP and implementation of the 
approved resolution plan. 
Further, prior to May 15, 2018, the Corporate Debtor and its said subsidiaries were under 
Strategic Debt Restructuring (SOR) and asset monetization and debt resolution plan were 
being worked out The Corporate Debtor and some of its subsidiaries have not provided 
Interest of Rs. 1,462 crore and Rs 2,625 calculated based on basic rate of interest as per 
terms of loan for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025 respectively and foreign 
exchange {gain)/loss aggregating to Rs 612 crore and Rs 669 crore for the quarter and half 
year ended September 30, 2025 respectively. Had the Company provided Interest and foreign 
exchange variation, the Loss would have been higher by Rs.2,074 crore and Rs 3,294 crore 
for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025 respectively and Net Worth of the 
Company as on September 30, 2025 and March 31, 2025 would have been lower by Rs 
40,867 crore and Rs.37,573 crores respectively The Auditors have drawn qualification for non­
provision of interest and foreign exchange variations in their Limited review report for the 
quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025. During the previous years. Interest of Rs. 
33,478 crore and foreign exchange loss (net) aggregating to Rs. 4,095 crore were not provided

equity shares to Axis Trustee (in its capacity as a security trustee for the Lender) for above loan 
facility. 
Owing to defaults in the repayment of the facilities availed by RCOM and RITL, Axis Trustee first

Classification and Reporting by commercial banks and select Fis bearing No. RBI/ DBS/ 2016-17/

passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in SBI vs. Rajesh Agarwal [2023 sec Online SC 342] has 
disposed of the said petitions filed by Mr. Punit Garg, setting aside the actions taken against the 
petitioners under the Circular . The Supreme Court has held that since the Circular does not 
expressly provide an opportunity of hearing to the borrowers before classifying their account as 
fraud, audi alteram partem has to be read into the provisions of the directions to save them from the 
vice of arbitrariness. 
It has further been made clear vide the Delhi High Court order, that if any FIR has been lodged, 
proceedings proceeded thereto will remain unaffected by the said order and that it will be open to 
concerned banks to proceed in accordance with law in light of the judgement of the Supreme Court.

17 During the earlier years, certain banks had issued show cause notices to the Corporate Debtor, 
certain subsidiaries and certain directors seeking reasons as to why the Corporate Debtor and its 
subsidiaries should not be classified as willful defaulter. Also during the earlier year, in the current 
period ended September 30, 2025, certain banks have served notice seeking explanation as to why 
the account of the Corporate Debtor and the subsidiary company RTL and RCIL should not be 
declared as fraud in terms of applicable Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulations. During the 
previous year, the Corporate Debtor and RTL and in current year RTL, had received intimation of 
order passed by willful defaulter identification committee of certain banks for inclusion of name of 
RCOM, RTL and its directors / guarantors etc. in credit information companies (CiCs) list of willful 
defaulters and seeking representation against the said order. Further, during the previous year, one 
of the banks has declared RTL as a willful defaulter. During the earlier year, in the current period 
ended September 30, 2025 and subsequently to the quarter ended September 30, 2025, certain 
banks have served a letter intimating that the bank has classified the account of the Corporate 
Debtor and RTL as fraud as per the applicable RBI regulations. The Corporate Debtor and its 
subsidiaries have been responding to said show cause notices and intimations, from time to time 
The Corporate Debtor in its response has highlighted that the proceedings and the classification of 
the Corporate Debtor as a willful defaulter is barred during the prevailing moratorium under section 
14 of the Code and protection is available in terms of section 32A of the Code and asserting that 
accordingly, no action can be said to lie against the Corporate Debtor for classification as fraud and 
requested the banks to withdraw the notices. Further, certain banks had issued notices seeking 
personal hearing by the authorized representative of the Corporate Debtor and its subsidiaries in 
respect of the aforesaid matter. Hearings were attended to and necessary submissions were made 
in accordance with the submissions made earlier in the responses to the show cause notices. 
Further, the Corporate Debtor and Reliance Telecom Limited (RTL) has received a letter dated 
August 7, 2023 from one of the banks, vide which the bank has indicated, inter alia, that it has 
received a forensic audit report dated October 15, 2020 of M/s BOO India LLP wherein certain 
'irregularities I anomalies / commissions/ omissions' have been pointed out by the forensic auditor. 
The said letter and report were accordingly tabled at the meeting of the Directors on August 12, 
2023. In respect of the same, the bank has sought the views, inter alia, of the erstwhile 
management of the Corporate Debtor on the said report The management had expressed that 
management views had not been sought prior to the issuance of the report. Further to receipt of a 
copy of the filings made before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the aforesaid matter, the Corporate 
Debtor and RTL had provided information to the forensic auditor during the period from March 2021 
to November 2021 and it is not yet ascertained if the report incorporates and has considered such 
information. RP however has maintained that the Corporate Debtor and RTL is undergoing 
corporate insolvency resolution process in terms of the Code and the forensic audit report prima 
facie appears to pertain to the period prior to the corporate insolvency resolution process, the 
Corporate Debtor and RTL has already responded to the letter that the proceedings and the 
classification of the Corporate Debtor and RTL as a fraud is barred during the prevailing moratorium 
under Section 14 of the Code and protection is available in terms of Section 32A of the Code and 
accordingly, no action should lie against the Corporate Debtor and RTL for classification as fraud 
and notice against the Corporate Debtor should be withdrawn and the RP, Corporate Debtor and 
RTL shall have a limited responsibility to only share any information sought from it 
Similar to the letter received on August 7, 2023, Corporate Debtor has also received another letter 
dated May 7, 2024 from another bank, where the bank has indicated, that with respect to the loan 
account of the Corporate Debtor, it has conducted a forensic audit wherein element of fraud is 
identifiable and before coming to final conclusion basis the forensic audit report dated October 15, 
2020, the bank has provided an opportunity to the Corporate Debtor to submit its representation as 
to why the Corporate Debtor's account should not be classified as 'fraud' in terms of the 'Master 
Directions on Frauds - Classification and Reporting by Commercial Banks and Select Fis' dated

Debtor has made necessary disclosures to the relevant stock exchange in accordance with the 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, the Corporate Debtor has also issued a response to the letter dated May 7, 
2024 maintaining a similar stance (as against the letter dated August 7, 2023) inter alia citing that 
the Corporate Debtor is undergoing corporate insolvency resolution process in terms of the Code 
and the forensic audit report prima facie appears to pertain to the period prior to the corporate 
insolvency resolution process and hence any classification of the loan accounts of the Corporate 
Debtor as a fraud during its ongoing CIRP is barred during the prevailing moratorium under Section 
14 of the Code and protection is available in terms of Section 32A of the Code and accordingly, no 
action should lie against the Corporate Debtor for classification as fraud and notice against the 
Corporate Debtor should be withdrawn. Currently, there is no impact of such notices/letter issued 
from banks, in the Standalone financial results. The Auditors have drawn qualification in their 
Limited review report for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025.

revenue expenditure for the purpose of computation of taxable income in a matter to which the 
Company is not a party, The Company has applied for renewal of its license as stated in Note 4 
above. The terms of renewed license regime are different from those of the licenses dealt with in the 
aforesaid judgement. Further, there have been no disallowances in earlier years, by the tax 
authorities, on the AGR payments claimed by the Company as revenue expenditure in its tax filings. 
In the absence of any claim by the tax authorities against the Company and/ or directions or 
clarifications from the income tax department in this regard, no adjustments have been made to 
these Standalone financial results for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025.

far, Accordingly, and in view of the above unauthorized and potentially fraudulent actions, the 
Company has removed the said director from the directorship of all US subsidiaries of RCOM

investigate the unauthorised and potentially fraudulent sale and investment transaction undertaken 
by the erstwhile director of Bonn (including the circumstances/ motive behind the same) as well as 
to ascertain the role of any other individuals involved in the matter. The final report in this regard 
has been received and the entire report was examined by the relevant stakeholders and their

Limited Review Report on Consolidated Unaudited Financial Results of Reliance 
Communications Limited for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025, 
pursuant to Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63(2) of the SEBI 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 as amended. 
To Board of Directors/ Resolution Professional (RP) of Reliance Communications Limited 
I. The Hon'b!e National Company Law Tribunal, Mumbai Bench (''NCL T") admitted an 
insolvency and bankruptcy petition filed by an operational creditor / financial creditor against 
Reliance Communications Limited and its two subsidiaries appointed Resolution Professional 
(RP) who has been vested with management of affairs and powers of the Board of Directors with 
direction to initiate appropriate action contemplated with extant provisions of the Insolvency and 
Bankruptcy Code, 2016 and other related rules. 
2. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Unaudited Financial 
Results of Reliance Communications Limited ('the Parent Company') and its subsidiaries 
(the Parent Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the 'Group'), and its share of 
net profit / (loss) after tax and total comprehensive income/ (loss) of its associates for the 
quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025 ("the Statement") attached herewith, being 
submitted by the Parent Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 and 
Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63(2) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 as amended ("Listing Regulations"). 
3. This Statement which is the responsibility of the Parent Company's Management and 
approved by the Parent's Board of Directors and taken on record by RP in their meeting held 
on November 14, 2025, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" prescribed 
under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act") and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement 
based on our review. 
4. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410, 'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity' issued by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A 
review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons 
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review 
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance 
with the Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that 
we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. 
Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
We also performed procedures in accordance with the circular issued by SEBI under 
Regulation 33 (8) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations 20 I 5, as amended to the extent applicable.

7. We draw attention to Note no. 5 of the Statement regarding admission of the Parent Company 
and its lwo subsidiaries into Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process ("CIRP") and pending 
determination of obligations and liabilities including various claims submitted by the 
Operational / financial / other creditors and employees including interest payable on Joans 
during CIRP. We are unable to comment the accounting impact thereof pending reconciliation 
and dctcrminalion of final obligation. 
The Parent Company and two of it's subsidiaries have not provided interest on borrowings 
amounting to Rs. 1,546 crore and Rs. 2,765 crorc for the quarter and half year ended September 
30, 2025 respectively and Rs. 35,241 crore up to the previous financial year based on the basic

Rs.674 crore and Rs. 737 crore for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025 
respectively and Rs.4,514 crore foreign exchange losses up to the previous financial year. Had 
such interest and foreign exchange variation (gain)/ loss as mentioned above been provided, the 
reported loss for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025 would have been higher by 
Rs. 2,220 crore and Rs. 3,502 crore respectively and Networth of the Group as on September 30, 
2025 and March 31, 2025 would have been lower by Rs. 43,257 crore and Rs. 39,755 crore 
respectively. Non provision of interest and non-recognition of foreign exchange variation 
(gain)/loss is not in compliance with Ind AS 23 "Borrowing Costs" and Ind AS 21 "The Effects 
of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates" respectively. 
8. We draw attention to Note no. 4 & 23 of the Statement, regarding the pending comprehensive 
review of carrying amount of all assets (including investments, receivables and balances lying in 
Goods and Service Tax) & liabilities, impairment of goodwill on consolidation and non­
provision for impairment of carrying value of assets and write back of liabilities if any, has not 
been made in the books of account by the Group pending completion of the CIRP and various 
irregularities reported by the forensic auditor Mis BOO India LLP, appointed by one of the 
lenders, in their forensic audit report for the period from Apri I O 1, 20 I 3 to March 31, 2017 as 
communicated by certain banks and communication received from certain banks with respect 
to willful defaulter and fraud. In the absence of comprehensive review as mentioned above for 
the carrying value of all other assets and liabilities and unable to determine of potential impact 
of communications from banks in respect of willful default/ fraud by the Management, we are 
unable to comment that whether any adjustment is required in the carrying amount of such assets 
and liabilities and consequential impact, if any, on the reported losses for the quarter and half 
year ended September 30, 2025. Non determination of fair value of financial assets & liabilities 
and impairment in carrying amount of other assets & liabilities are not in compliance with Ind 
AS I 09 "Financial Instruments", Ind AS 36 "Impairment of Assets" and Ind AS 37 "Provisions , 
Contingent Liabilities & Contingent Assets". 
9. We draw attention to Note no. 25 of the Statement, wherein during the earlier year, erstwhile 
director of Bonn lnvestment Inc. ("Bonn") had sold its property for an amount of USD 8.34 
million (approx. Rs.69.55 Crore) and invested the same with AZCO Real Estate Brokers LLC 
("J\ZCO") without the authorisation / permission of the Managem ent and Re so lution

undertaken including recovery of the advance given to AZCO. The Management of Ronn is 
hopeful that the steps taken and discussion with AZCO will result in recovering the said advance 
and accordingly, no provision has been made in the financial statements for the quarter and half 
year ended September 30, 2025 against the said advance. Also, the Holding Company has filed a 
petition against the erstwhile Director of Holding Co111pany based on the digital analysis report 
for his involvement in the aforesaid transactions. Further, the financial results/statements of 
Bonn for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025, for the year ended March 31, 
2025 and March 31, 2024, considered for consolidation is unaudited and certified by the 
Management. 
Based on Lhe matters fully described in the aforesaid note and evidence provided to us by the 
Management, we are unable to determine on the potential impact if any in the unaudited 
financial statements of Bonn in relation to unauthorised sale made by the erstwhile director of 
Bonn and involvement of erstwhile director of Holding Company if any on the said transactions 
and we arc unable to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to consider the 
management assessment of the said advance as good for recovery. 
Further, since, the financial statements are unaudited and certified by the management, the 
amounts and financial information considered for consolidation is solely based on the unaudited 
financial information certified by the management. We are unable to determine the consequent 
effects if any on the financial position of Bonn in case the said accounts gets audited and we are 
unable to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence of management assessment of going 
concern assumption while preparation of the financial results/statements of Bonn for the quarter 
ended September 30, 2025, for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, for the year ended March 31, 
2025 and March 31, 2024. 
10. We draw attention to Note no. 29 of the Statement regarding searches carried out by Directorate 
of Enforcement (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) at the premises of Reliance 
Communications Limited during the quarter ended September 30, 2025, based on F!Rs 
registered with CBI. Further, certain properties of the subsidiary Companies have also been 
provisionally attached in terms of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 by ED. As stated 
by the Management, the actions taken by the agencies may adversely affect the value of assets of 
the Group, however no adjustment has been carried out in the books of account. Based on the 
matters stated in aforesaid note, we are unable to determine the potential impact if any, in 
respect of the pending investigation and provisional attachment by the regulatory agencies that 
may be required in the consolidated financial results for the quarter and half year ended 
September 30, 2025. 
I I. We draw attention to Note no. 13 of the Statement, regarding non adoption of Ind AS 116 
"Leases" effective from April 0 1, 2019, and the impact thereof. The Parent Company and some 
of its subsidiaries have not applied Ind AS 116. The aforesaid accounting treatment is not in 
accordance with the relevant Indian Accounting Standard Ind AS 116.

12. We draw attention to Note no. 3, 4 & 8 of the Statement, regarding termination of defini tive 
binding agreement for monetization of assets of the Company and its subsidiaries namely RTL 
& RITL (ceased w.e.f December 22, 2022) and the ongoing CIRP, the outcome of whi ch cannot 
be presently ascertained. Further the Parent Company's subsidiary namely Reliance 
Communication Infrastructure Limited (RCIL) has also been admitted under Code with effect 
from September 25, 2019. The Group continues to incur losses, and its current liabilities exceed 
current assets and the Group has defaulted in repayment of its borrowings and payment of 
statutory dues and pending application of renewal of Telecom Licenses and potential impact of 
the matters stated in note no 23, 25 and 29. Further, auditors of associate companies of the 
Parent Company have given emphasis of matter paragraphs relating to Going Concern in their 
respective limited review report. 
This situation indicates that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the 
Group's ability to continue as a going concern. The accounts, however, has been prepared by the 
management on a going concern basis for the reason stated in the aforesaid note. However, we 
are unable to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding management's use of the 
going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the consolidated financial results, in 
view of ongoing CIRP and matters pending before regulatory authorities, the outcome of which 
cannot be presently ascertained. 
13. We draw attention to Note no. 17 of the Statement regarding non receipt of balance confirmation 
from Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for balance in Fixed Deposit (FD) account 
amounting to Rs. 32.79 crore as at September 30, 2025 in respect of one of the subsidiary. 
Pending receipt of balance confirmation as on reporting date, we are unable to comment on the 
consequential impact if any, on the unaudited consolidated financial results of the Group. 
14. Based on our review conducted and procedures as stated in paragraph 4 above and based on the 
consideration of the review reports of other auditors referred to in paragraph 17 below, except 
for the possible effects of the matters stated in paragraphs 6 to 13 above, nothing has come to 
our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement , prepared in accordanc e 
with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Accounting 
Standards i.e. Indian Accounting Standards ('Ind AS') prescribed under Section 133 of the Act 
read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in 
India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 and 
Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63(2) of the SEBI (Listing Obligati ons and Disclosur e 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 as amended including the manner in which it is to be 
disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.

of the Holding Company has invoked shares of Globalcom IDC Limited (GIDC) a step down

against liability will be given by the Management on receipt of the said details from the lender. 
Our conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter.

allowed the management of the Corporate Debtor to function. In accordance with the order of the 
Hon'ble NCLAT, Mr. Pardeep Kumar Sethi handed over the control and management of the

vacated. On the basis of the orders of the Hon'ble NCLAT, Mr. Pardeep Kumar Sethi, wrote to the 
management of the Corporate Debtor on May 02, 2019 requesting the charge, operations and 
management of the Corporate Debtor to be handed over back to IRP. Therefore, Mr. Pardeep 
Kumar Sethi had in his capacity as IRP taken control and custody of the management and 
operations of the Corporate Debtor from May 02, 2019. Subsequently, the committee of creditors 
("CoC") of the Corporate Debtor pursuant to its meeting held on May 30, 2019 resolved, with 
requisite voting share, to replace the existing interim resolution professional, i.e. Mr. Pardeep 
Kumar Sethi with Mr. Anish Niranjan Nanavaty as the resolution professional for the Corporate

The Corporate Debtor had filed applications with the DoT for migration of various telecom licenses 
[Universal Access Service License (UASL), National Long Distance (NLD) and International Long 
Distance (ILD) licenses] to the Unified License regime (UL) on October 25, 2020 (17 of which were 
supposed to expire on July 19, 2021). On June 15, 2021, the DoT has issued a letter to the 
Corporate Debtor requiring payments of various categories of certain amounts such as 10% of the 
AGR dues. deferred spectrum installments falling due within the CIRP period, etc. against the 
telecom licenses, stating such dues to be in the nature of "current dues" and prescribing such 
payment as a pre-condition to the consideration/processing of the migration applications ("DoT 
Letter"). On June 25, 2021, the Corporate Debtor has issued a letter to DoT clarifying that the 
various categories of dues stipulated by the DoT are not in the nature of the "current dues" and are 
to be resolved within the framework of the Code (being dues that pertain to the period prior to May 
7, 2019) and/ or are not payable at present, and requesting that making payments against the said 
dues should not be mandated as a pre-condition for further processing of the migration applications 
filed by the Corporate Debtor. 
In light of the urgency of the matter, the RP had filed an application before the NCL T in both RCOM 
and RTL praying that the DoT inter alia be restrained from taking any action which may interfere 
with the continued holding of the telecom spectrum of the Corporate Debtor. The NCL T had 
adjourned the matter following which the RP had thereafter filed a writ petition in the Delhi High 
Court seeking issuance of an appropriate writ, order or direction in the nature of mandamus 
directing the DoT to migrate the telecom licenses to UL without the insistence on the payment of 
the dues set out in DoT Letter. The Delhi High Court, on July 19, 2021, passed an interim order 
that "till the next date, the respondent is directed to not take any coercive action against the 
petitioner for withdrawal of the telecom spectrum granted to the petitioner in respect of 18 service 
areas, as also to permit the petitioner to continue providing telecom services in the 18 service 
areas which are subject matters of the present petition." On July 20. 2021, the writ petition hearing 
concluded and order was passed by the Delhi High Court permitting the withdrawal of the writ 
petition with direction that the issue on "current dues" should be decided by the NCL T and 
extending the protection under the July 19, 2021 order by further 10 days. 
In view of the aforesaid. the NCLT was apprised of the order of the Delhi High Court and the NCL T 
has, as an interim measure, extended the ad interim protection granted by the Delhi High Court 
until the next date of hearing. Further, on August 12, 2021, the NCL T has directed that the interim 
orders shall continue until the next date of hearing. The issue under consideration by the NCL T 
relates to whether the dues being claimed by DoT in its letter of June 15. 2021 for the purposes of 
processing the license renewal/ migration applications of the Corporate Debtor are in the nature of 
"current dues" (within the meaning of the Explanation to Section 14( 1} of the Code) and therefore, 
payable during the CIRP period. The application was listed on various occasions before the NCL T;

of surplus license fees, issued by the DoT lo the extent that they 
(a} Restrict companies undergoing insolvency from claiming surplus adjustment only after

permitted to file a rejoinder to the counter affidavit This matter was last listed on October 28,

Considering these developments including, in particular, the RP having taken over the 
management and control of the Corporate Debtor and its subsidiaries, i.e. RTL and RCIL (with 
RCIL presently being under the management and control of the monitoring committee constituted 
in terms of its resolution plan which was approved by the NCL T on December 19, 2023 and the 
resolution plan implementation being still pending) ("Group") inter alia with the objective of running 
them as going concerns, the consolidated financial results continue to be prepared on going 
concern basis. Since the Group continues to incur losses, current liabilities exceed current assets 
and Group has defaulted in repayment of borrowings, payment of regulatory and statutory dues 
and pending renewal of telecom licenses, these events indicate that material uncertainty exists 
that may cast significant doubt on Group's ability to continue as a going concern. The Auditors 
have drawn qualification in their Limited review report for the quarter and half year ended 
September 30, 2025. 
5. Considering various factors including admission of the Corporate Debtor and its subsidiaries; RTL 
and RCIL to CIRP under the Code, there are various claims submitted by the operational creditors, 
the financial creditors, employees and other creditors. The overall obligations and liabilities 
including obligation for interest on loans and the principal rupee amount in respect of loans 
including foreign currency denominated loans shall be determined during the CIRP and accounting 
impact, if any, will be given on completion of CIRP and implementation of the approved resolution 
plan. 
Further, prior to May 15, 2018, the Corporate Debtor and its said subsidiaries were under Strategic 
Debt Restructuring (SOR) and asset monetization and debt resolution plan were being worked out. 
The Corporate Debtor and some of its subsidiaries have not provided Interest of Rs. 1,546 crore 
and Rs. 2,765 crore calculated based on basic rate of interest as per terms of loan for the quarter 
and half year ended September 30, 2025 respectively and foreign exchange (gain)/loss 
aggregating to Rs 674 crore and Rs. 737 crore for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 
2025 respectively. Had the Group provided Interest and foreign exchange variation, the Loss 
would have been higher by Rs. 2,220 crore and Rs. 3,502 crore for the quarter and half year 
ended September 30, 2025 and Net Worth of the Group as on September 30, 2025 and March 31, 
2025 would have been lower by Rs. 43,257 crore and Rs. 39,755 crore respectively. The Auditors 
have drawn qualification for non-provision of interest and foreign exchange variations in their 
Limited review report for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025. During the previous 
years, Interest of Rs. 35,241 crore and foreign exchange loss (net) aggregating to Rs. 4,514 crore

matter could not be heard owing to paucity of time and was listed on May 22, 2025. On May 22, 
2025, the Bench extensively heard arguments and stated that the matter would be listed for further 
arguments on a further date. The matter was listed on August 7, 2025, wherein the Bench was 
pleased to reserve the matter for orders and has directed parties to file written submissions within a

18. During the earlier year, pursuant to a letter retrieved by the Corporate Debtor on August 17, 2023, 
as part of a routine compliance check. from the official website of Netherlands Chamber of 
Commerce KVK. it has come to its attention that Reliance Globalcom B.V, The Netherlands. 
(RGBV), a subsidiary of RCOM, has been de-registered from the Trade Register of the Netherlands 
Chamber of Commerce KVK, with effect from June 01, 2023. Accordingly, RGBV was 
deconsolidated for the purpose of and as per requirement of Ind AS 110 "Consolidated Financial

consolidated financial results on a line by line basis. 
19. During the earlier year, the Company received a notice from Axis Trustee Services Limited ("Axis 
Trustee" / "Security Trustee") on November 9, 2022 regarding invocation cum sale of pledged 
shares Globalcom IDC Limited ("GIDC"). Thereafter, the Company received a notice of invocation

As a matter of background, it may be noted that Reliance Webstore Limited ("RWSL", "Parent 
Company") is a wholly owned subsidiary of RCOM, holding 100% of equity shares in GIDC. 
Accordingly, GIDC was a wholly owned step-down subsidiary of RCOM. Vide facilities agreemeni 
dated August 29, 2016, RCOM and RITL had availed a loan facility of Rs 565 Crore and Rs. 635

equity shares to Axis Trustee (in its capacity as a securi1y trustee for the Lender) for above loan 
facility 
Owing to defaults in the repayment of the facilities availed by RCOM and RITL, Axis Trustee first 
proceeded to issue a notice for the invocation cum sale of pledged shares on November 9, 2022, 
and thereafter, invoked the pledge on December 12, 2022. 
On account of said invocation, the parent company does not have any control over the GIDC. 
Accordingly, during the earlier year, GIDC has been de-subsidiarised w.e.f. December 12, 2022 
and the impact of loss of control (without the value of shares invoked) over GIDC amounting to Rs. 
106 crore was charged to the consolidated financial results as an exceptional item in the earlier 
year. 
The impact of loss of control given in the books of account is without the value of shares invoked by 
the lender. The management will give the effect of the value of invocation of shares with the 
corresponding decrease in the value of liability on the receipt of the said details from the lender. 
This matter has been referred to by the Auditors in their Limited review report for the quarter and 
half year ended September 30, 2025.

Advance under other non-current assets in the consolidated financial results, pending verification of 
invoices and work completion certification.

passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in SBI vs. Rajesh Agarwal [2023 SCC Online SC 342] has 
disposed of the said petitions filed by Mr. Punit Garg, setting aside the actions taken against the 
petitioners under the Circular . The Supreme Court has held that since the Circular does not 
expressly provide an opportunity of hearing to the borrowers before classifying their account as 
fraud, audi alteram partem has to be read into the provisions of the directions to save them from the 
vice of arbitrariness, 
It has further been made clear vide the Delhi High Court order, that if any FIR has been lodged, 
proceedings proceeded thereto will remain unaffected by the said order and that it will be open lo 
concerned banks to proceed in accordance with law in light of the judgement of the Supreme Court.

time. The Corporate Debtor in its response has highlighted that the proceedings and the 
classification of the Corporate Debtor as a willful defaulter is barred during the prevailing 
moratorium under section 14 of the Code and protection is available in terms of section 32A of the 
Code and asserting that accordingly, no action can be said to lie against the Corporate Debtor for 
classification as fraud and requested the banks to withdraw the notices. Further, certain banks had 
issued notices seeking personal hearing by the authorized representative of the Corporate Debtor 
and its subsidiaries in respect of the aforesaid matter. Hearings were attended to and necessary 
submissions were made in accordance with the submissions made earlier in the responses to the 
show cause notices.

management of the Corporate Debtor on the said report. The management had expressed that 
management views had not been sought prior to the issuance of the report Further to receipt of a 
copy of the filings made before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in the aforesaid matter, the Corporate 
Debtor and RTL had provided information to the forensic auditor during the period from March 2021 
to November 2021 and it is not yet ascertained if the report incorporates and has considered such 
information. RP however has maintained that the Corporate Debtor and RTL is undergoing

Similar to the letter received on August 7, 2023, Corporate Debtor has also received another letter 
dated May 7, 2024 from another bank, where the bank has indicated, that with respect to the loan 
account of the Corporate Debtor, it has conducted a forensic audit wherein element of fraud is 
identifiable and before coming to final conclusion basis the forensic audit report dated October 15, 
2020, the bank has provided an opportunity to the Corporate Debtor to submit its representation as 
to why the Corporate Debtor's account should not be classified as 'fraud' in terms of the 'Master 
Directions on Frauds - Classification and Reporting by Commercial Banks and Select Fis' dated 
July 1, 2016 issued by Reserve Bank of India. On receipt of the said letter, while the Corporate 
Debtor has made necessary disclosures to the relevant stock exchange in accordance with the 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations. 2015. the Corporate Debtor has also issued a response to the letter dated May 7, 
2024 maintaining a similar stance (as against the letter dated August 7, 2023) inter alia citing that 
the Corporate Debtor is undergoing corporate insolvency resolution process in terms of the Code 
and the forensic audit report prima facie appears to pertain to the period prior to the corporate 
insolvency resolution process and hence any classification of the loan accounts of the Corporate 
Debtor as a fraud during its ongoing CIRP is barred during the prevailing moratorium under Section 
14 of the Code and protection is available in terms of Section 32A of the Code and accordingly, no 
action should lie against the Corporate Debtor for classification as fraud and notice against the 
Corporate Debtor should be withdrawn. Currently, there is no impact of such notices/letter issued 
from banks. in the consolidated financial results. The Auditors have drawn qualification in their 
Limited review report for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025.

Company is not a party. The Company has applied for renewal of its license as stated in Note 4 
above. The terms of renewed license regime are different from those of the licenses dealt with in 
the aforesaid judgement. Further, there have been no disallowances in earlier years, by the tax 
authorities, on the AGR payments claimed by the Company as revenue expenditure in its tax filings.

the amount already invested, i.e. USO 8.2 million, which is part of the sale proceeds of the 
Property. This entire transaction did not have approval from the shareholders (including RCOM). 
The Company sent a notice to the director seeking clarification regarding the same but has not 
received any credible explanation so far. Accordingly, and in view of the above unauthorized and 
potentially fraudulent actions, the Company has removed the said director from the directorship of 
all US subsidiaries of RCOM including Bonn on August 21, 2024 and has appointed a new 
director in her place on the same date (as applicable). The new Director has since been 
interacting with the removed director and has asked questions on the transactions 
directly/through counsel, but the response from removed director remains elusive. Further, Bonn 
(through the newly appointed director) is in the process of examining the legal remedies for the 
actions taken by the said erstwhile director as well as for recovery of the advance against 
investment given to AZCO. As the director of Bonn is hopeful about the recovery of the advance 
against investment given to AZCO, no provision has been made in financial statements. 
Furthermore, Bonn (through the newly appointed director) had also commissioned a digital 
analysis of the various email correspondence exchanged by the erstwhile director of Bonn, with 
the erstwhile director / erstwhile management of the Company, to further investigate the 
unauthorised and potentially fraudulent sale and investment transaction undertaken by the 
erstwhile director of Bonn (including the circumstances / motive behind the same) as well as to 
ascertain the role of any other individuals involved in the matter. The final report in this regard has 
been received and the entire report was examined by the relevant stakeholders and their 
advisors, for any further action to be taken pursuant to the findings in the report. In particular, this 
report highlighted the involvement of a director of RCOM (powers suspended) in authorizing the 
sale of the said Property. Basis the same, RP has issued an email communication dated 
February 6, 2025 to the said director of RCOM, seeking his response on his involvement in the 
above potentially fraudulent transaction. On February 14, 2025, the director vide his email denied 
the allegations without providing any further justification. On February 21, 2025, the said director 
of RCOM vide his email requested copies of all information and correspondence relied upon by 
the RP in connection with the email communication dated February 6, 2025 sent by the RP. The 
same were provided by the RP via email communication dated March 03, 2025 along with a 
suitable reply to the said director of RCOM The said director of RCOM vide his letter dated April 
1, 2025 has tendered his resignation. Meanwhile, the RP has also made his determination on
