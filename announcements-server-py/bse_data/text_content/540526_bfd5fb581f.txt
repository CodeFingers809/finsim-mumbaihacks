value at the end of the explicit forecast period is then determined and that value is also 
discounted back to the valuation date to give an overall value for the business.

Independent Auditor's Review Report on Consolidated Unaudited Financial Information of IRB lnvlT 
Fund for the quarter and year to date pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Board of India 
(Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014, as amended, including any guidelines and 
circulars issued thereunder. 
To 
The Board of Directors 
IRB Infrastructure Private Limited 
(Acting in capacity as the Investment Manager of IRB lnvlT Fund) 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of consolidated unaudited financial Information of IRB 
lnvlT Fund (hereinafter referred to as 'the Holding Company') and its subsidiaries (the Holding 
Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the 'Group') for the quarter ended September 30, 
2025 and the year to-date Information for the period from April 1, 2025 to September 30, 2025. ('the 
Statement') attached herewith, being submitted by the Investment Manager pursuant to the 
requirements of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) 
Regulations, 2014, as amended, including any guidelines and circulars issued thereunder (together 
known as 'lnvlT Regulations' ). 
2. This Statement , which is the responsibility of the Investment Manager and approved by the Investment 
Manager's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement 
principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 'Interim Financial Reporting' prescribed under 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 read with relevant rules issued thereunder (' Ind 
AS 34') to the extent not inconsistent with Inv IT Regulations and other recognised accounting 
principles generally accepted in India read with lnvlT Regulations. Our responsibility is to express a 
conclusion on the Statement based on our review . 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements 
(SRE) 2410, 'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the 
Entity' issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial 
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of Investment Manager's personnel responsible for 
financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing specified 
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all 
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit 
opinion. 
We also performed procedures in accordance with Regulation 13(2)(e) of the lnvlT Regulations, as 
amended, to the extent applicable .

Independent Auditor's Review Report on Standalone Unaudited Financial Information of IRB lnvlT Fund 
for the quarter and year to date pursuant to Securities and Exchange Board of India (Infrastructure 
Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014, as amended, including any guidelines and circulars issued 
thereunder. 
To 
The Board of Directors 
IRB Infrastructure Private Limited 
(Acting in capacity as the Investment Manager of IRB lnvlT Fund) 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of standalone unaudited financial Information of IRB 
lnvlT Fund (hereinafter referred to as 'the Trust') for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 and the 
year to-date Information for the period from April 1, 2025 to September 30, 2025 ('the Statement') 
attached herewith, being submitted by the Investment Manager pursuant to the requirements of the 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014, as 
amended, including any guidelines and circulars issued thereunder (together known as 'lnvlT 
Regulations•). 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Investment Manager and has been approved by the 
Investment Manager's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 'Interim Financial Reporting', 
prescribed under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, read with relevant rules issued 
thereunder ('Ind AS 34') to the extent not inconsistent with lnvlT Regulations and other recognised 
accounting principles generally accepted in India read with lnvlT Regulations. Our responsibility is to 
express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements 
(SRE) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the 
Entity" issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial 
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of Investment Manager's personnel responsible for 
financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and 
consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant 
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
4. Based on our review conducted as stated in paragraph 3 above, nothing has come to our attention that 
causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34 to the extent not inconsistent with lnvlT Regulations (as 
explained in the Emphasis of Matter paragraph 5 below) and other recognised accounting principles 
generally accepted in India read with lnvlT Regulations, has not disclosed the information required to 
be disclosed in terms of the lnvlT Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or 
that it contains any material misstatement.

5. We draw attention to Note 4 to the Statement which describes the presentation of 'Unit Capita_!' as 
'Equity' to comply with the lnvlT Regulations. Our conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter. 
6. The Standalone financial results of the Trust for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, period ended 
September 30, 2024 and year ended March 31, 2025, were reviewed/audited by another auditor whose 
report dated Jule 21, 2025, October 28, 2024 and May 8, 2025 respectively expressed an unmodified 
conclusion/opinion on that Statement 
The Statement includes financial information for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, for the quarter 
ended September 30, 2024, for the period from April 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024 and as at 
September 30, 2024, as referred to in Note 5, prepared by the Investment Manager which have been 
approved by the Board of Directors of the Investment Manager and have not been subjected to review 
by us or by another auditor. 
Our conclusion is not modified in respect of the above matters .

Indian Economy Outlook
Infra Sector
Infrastructure is a key enabler in helping 
India become a USD 26 trillion economy 
by 2047. 
Capital investment outlay for infrastructure 
has been increased by Rs. 11.21 trillion in 
the FY2026 budget estimate (BE), 
compared to Rs 10.2 trillion in the FY2025 
revised estimate (RE), marking a 10.1 per 
cent year-on-year growth; which would be 
3.1% of the GDP.
The IMF, in its January 2025 World Economic Outlook Update, has projected that India's 
economy will grow at 6.5% each in 2025-26 and 2026-27. With this, India will remain the 
fastest-growing economy, and based on the calendar year, the IMF sees India's economy 
growing at 6.8% in 2025 and 6.5% in 2026.

Investment in road infrastructure is 
long-term and returns are seen several 
years after construction. Roads and 
highways are financed through 
Government and private sources. 
Funding from Government sources 
includes budgetary allocations.
Financing infrastructure
Private financing
Under private financing, the private 
developer builds a road, and in return 
has the right to collect toll for a 
specified period of time. The developer 
is responsible for the maintenance of 
roads during this period. 
Public financing
Funding from government sources 
includes budgetary allocations, which 
are financed from taxes, cesses, or 
dedicated road funds. Publicly funded 
projects are usually given to 
contractors under various contract 
models such as the Engineering 
Procurement Construction (EPC).
Projects
Financing in road sector & MoRTH, NHAI budget
The Ministry is estimated to spend INR 2,87,333 
crore in 2025-26. This is 2% higher than the 
revised estimates for 2024-25 (INR 2,80,519 
crore). Major allocations are towards NHAI and 
expenditure on roads and bridges as show:
Note: BE – Budget Estimate, RE – Revised 
Estimate; “Total” includes recoveries which have 
not been shown in the table; “Others” covers 
establishment expenditure of the central 
government and allocations towards road transport 
and safety.
Allocation to Roads and Bridges 
In 2025–26, the government has allocated INR 
1,16,292 crore towards the development and 
maintenance of roads and bridges. This marks a 
5% increase over the revised estimates for 2024 - 
25. Expenditure under this allocation includes:
Under the EPC model, Government 
pays private players to lay roads. The 
private player has no role in the road’s 
ownership, toll collection or 
maintenance.
Types of projects awarded by NHAI
b. Build Operate Transfer (“BOT”)
c. Hybrid Annuity Model (“HAM”)
HAM is a hybrid model, a mix of the 
EPC and BOT (build, operate, transfer) 
models. HAM combines EPC (40 per 
cent) and BOT-Annuity (60 per cent). 
On behalf of the government, NHAI 
releases 40 per cent of the total project 
cost. The balance 60 per cent is 
arranged by the developer.
Private players build, operate and 
maintain the road for a specified period 
before transferring the asset back to 
the Government. The private player 
arranges all the finances for the 
project, while collecting toll revenue/ 
annuity fee from the Government.

Valuation Methodologies - Income Approach
Discounted 
Cash Flows 
(“DCF”)
• Under a DCF approach, forecast cash flows are discounted back to the present date, generating a net present value for the cash flow stream of the 
business. A terminal value at the end of the explicit forecast period is then determined and that value is also discounted back to the valuation date to give 
an overall value for the business. 
• A discounted cash flow methodology typically requires the forecast period to be of such a length to enable the business to achieve a stabilized level of 
earnings, or to be reflective of an entire operation cycle for more cyclical industries. 
• The rate at which the future cash flows are discounted (“the discount rate”) should reflect not only the time value of money, but also the risk associated 
with the business’ future operations. The discount rate most generally employed is weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”), reflecting an optimal as 
opposed to actual financing structure.
• In calculating the terminal value, regard must be had to the business’ potential for further growth beyond the explicit forecast period. The “constant 
growth model”, which applies an expected constant level of growth to the cash flow forecast in the last year of the forecast period and assumes such 
growth is achieved in perpetuity, is a common method. These results would be cross-checked, however, for reasonability to implied exit multiples.
• Due to the finite life of the concession period of the SPVs, we have not computed a terminal value for the valuation of the SPVs.
• The rate at which future cash flows are discounted should reflect not only the time value of the cash flows but also the risk associated with the business’ 
future operations. This means that in order for a DCF to produce a sensible valuation figure, the importance of the quality of the underlying cash flow 
forecasts is fundamental.
• The DCF approach has been applied in the valuation of the SPVs.

Valuation Methodologies - Market Approach
Comparable 
Transactions 
(“CoTrans”)
• Under comparable transactions method, the value of shares / business of a company is determined based on market multiples of publicly disclosed 
transactions in the similar space as that of the subject company. Due to different purposes of investments, transaction rationale and synergy benefits, 
different control premiums and minority discounts are embedded in the transaction values.
• Multiples are generally based on data from recent transactions in a comparable sector, but with appropriate adjustment after consideration has been 
given to the specific characteristics of the business being valued.
• The list of transactions in the road segment have mix of assets which are at different stages of operation / development / revenue mix/ leasing period. 
Therefore, comparable transactions method has not been considered for the valuation of IRB InvIT Fund and SPVs.
Comparable 
Companies 
(“CoCo”)
• Under comparable companies method, the value of shares / business of a company is determined based on market multiples of publicly traded 
comparable companies. Although no two companies are entirely alike, the companies selected as comparable companies should be engaged in the 
same or a similar line of business as the subject company. 
• The appropriate multiple is generally based on the performance of listed companies with similar business models and size. 
• The CoCo methodology has not been applied in the valuation of IRB InvIT Fund and SPVs.
• The list of companies in the road segment have mix of assets which are at different stages of operation / development / revenue mix/ leasing period. 
Therefore, comparable companies' method is not considered. 
• Under this approach, the value of the business is arrived at considering the market price of the company based on the daily moving averages of the last 
six-month volume traded weighted average of closing price on the stock exchange where the company’s shares are most frequently traded.
• The market price methodology has not been considered in the valuation of SPVs as it is not publicly listed or traded on any stock exchange.

Valuation Methodologies – Cost Approach
Net Asset 
Value (“NAV”) 
Method
• Under the net asset value approach, total value is based on the sum of net asset value as recorded on the balance sheet. 
• A net asset methodology is most applicable for businesses where the value lies in the underlying assets and not the ongoing operations of the business.
• The net assets methodology has not been considered for the valuation of IRB InvIT Fund and SPVs as the Targets are operational and the financials are 
made on a going concern basis.
Replacement 
Cost New
• The replacement cost of a business is the cost of acquiring similar assets employed in the business and/or reaching a similar level of development. A 
purchaser, faced with a build versus buy scenario, may be prepared to pay significantly over and above this cost to obtain advantages including time 
saved in developing a similar business, and risk of failure. 
• The replacement cost method quantifies the cost and risk to reach the present stage of development.
• This approach is often used for start-up/non-mature technology or biotech businesses.
• Hence, the replacement cost method has not been considered. 
Market Value of 
Assets or 
Realizable 
Value
• Under the market value methodology, total value is based on the sum of market value of asset less market value of liabilities plus, the value of intangible 
assets not recorded on the balance sheet.
• This methodology is most applicable for businesses where the value lies in the underlying assets and not the ongoing operations of the business.
• Hence, the market value method has not been considered.

Procedures adopted
We have carried out the Enterprise Valuation of the SPVs, in accordance with valuation standards as specified / applicable as per SEBI InvIT Regulations, to the extent applicable. 
In connection with this analysis, we have adopted the following procedures to carry out the valuation analysis: 
• Requested and received financial and qualitative information relating to the SPVs.
• Considered the key terms of concession agreements; 
• Analysis of the Management Business Plan; 
• Considered the Traffic Study Reports from the independent consultant; 
• Discussed with the Management on: background of the SPVs– business and fundamental factors that affect its earning-generating capacity and historical and expected financial performance;
• Analysis of the key economic and industry factors which may affect the valuation of the SPVs; 
• Analysis of the information available in public domain/ subscribed databases in respect of the comparable companies/ comparable transactions, as considered relevant by us; 
• Conducted site visits in March / April 2025 to assess the operating condition of the projects under the SPVs as per the requirements of SEBI (InvIT Regulations) 2014 (as amended);
• Selection of valuation approach and valuation methodology, in accordance with SEBI (InvIT Regulations), as considered appropriate and relevant by us;
• Analysis of other publicly available information, as considered relevant by us; and 
• Determination of Enterprise Value of the SPVs and equity value of IRBI InvIT Fund as on the Valuation Date.

Discount Rate and Terminal Value
Discount rate
In order to determine the discount rate, we have used the WACC methodology as set out below:
WACC = Ke * ( E/(D + E)) + Kd * (1-T) * ( D/(D + E)) 
Where:  Ke = cost of equity
  E = market value of equity
  Kd = cost of debt
  D = market value of debt
  T = corporate taxation rate
The cost of equity is derived using the Capital Asset Pricing Model 
(“CAPM”) as follows:
  Ke = Rf + ß * (Rm – Rf) +  
Where: Rf = the current return on risk-free assets
  Rm = the expected average return of the  
 market 
  (Rm – Rf) = the average risk premium above the  
   risk - free rate that a “market” portfolio of assets is earning
  ß = the beta factor, being the measure of the systematic risk of a 
  particular asset relative to the risk of a portfolio of all risky 
  assets
   = company specific risk factor (alpha)
Terminal Value
• Due to the finite life of the concession period of the SPVs, we have not computed a terminal 
value for the valuation of the SPVs.

WACC Parameters
Source(s): Management information
a. Risk free rate (Rf)
• Risk free rate forms the basis for any discount rate estimation using the build up 
methodology. As the name implies, this rate should not take into account any risk factors 
and should only include two general components – time value of money and inflation.
• Since there are no investments that are truly risk free, the risk free rate is commonly 
approximated by reference to yield on long-term debt instruments issued by government of 
India. 
• For our analysis, the nominal risk-free rate is based 10 year benchmark government of 
India securities yield as well as analysis of the consensus forecast yield which stands at 
6.4%. 
b. Market risk premium
• Market risk premium is the difference between the expected return on the market as a 
whole and the risk-free rate (like the return on government bonds). This premium 
compensates investors for taking on the higher risk associated with investing in the stock 
market
• The ERP is not directly observable in the market and therefore must be estimated. There 
are various approaches for estimating ERP which can be categorized as (i) Historical ERP 
approach (ii) Surveys and (iii) implied ERP approach. Historical ERP is most commonly 
used approach, and we have used the same. Under this method the ERP is estimated as 
the difference between broad based equity market index returns and government debt 
returns over a selected sample period. Different assumptions considered in this approach 
include – selection of Time period for measurement, stock market benchmark and the risk 
free rate.
• The historical ERP can be estimated using any historical period; however, it is frequently 
calculated using a long back period. When calculated over a long period, the historical ERP 
is found to be relatively consistent with lower standard of error. We have considered long 
term returns on BSE Sensex index for our estimation of ERP over long period of time.
• Rf is subtracted from stock index returns for estimating ERP. The difference between Rf 
and market returns is averaged over the period to estimate the range.
• Based on our calculations, while Equity risk premium varies per period, it converges around 
7 per cent. We have considered ERP of 7 per cent in our estimation of WACC.
c. Beta
• Beta is a measure of the risk of the shares of a company. ß is the co-variance between the 
return on sample stock and the return on the market. In order to determine the appropriate 
beta factor for the Company, consideration must be given either to the market beta of the 
Company or betas of comparable quoted companies. 
• We have screened for companies in the road operating industry and infrastructure 
investment trusts. We have also included InvIT in the transmission sector that are based on 
a BOT model. We have considered companies operating in India.
• Betas are low in this industry due to the stable nature of the road operating industry and low 
level of cash flow volatility due to the relatively steady usage of roads. We have arrived at a 
levered beta of 0.94. This includes the additional risk due to debt financing of the 
comparable companies. 
• Adjusted Beta = (0.67* Raw Beta)+ (0.33*1)
• We have then unlevered and then Relevered this beta using the optimal capital structure 
and tax rate applicable to the each SPV to reflect difference in operating leverage across 
comparable companies.
Unlevered beta = Beta / [ 1 + (1-tax rate)* Debt to Equity ratio}
Relevered beta = Unlevered Beta * [ 1 + (1-tax rate)* Debt to Equity ratio}
• We have considered Median of re-levered beta of comparable companies for our WACC 
estimation of BOT SPV’s. Given lower risk attached with cash flows for HAM assets, We 
have considered Quartile 1 of Relevered beta of comparable companies for estimating 
WACC for VK1.

WACC Parameters
Source(s): Management information
d. Alpha
• The Alpha factor incorporates company specific risk factor to reflect different stages of 
maturity and levels of uncertainty that are not already reflected in the projected cash flows. 
Considering the length of remaining concession period, forecast cashflows and discussion 
with the Management, We have considered an alpha at 1% in IRBJD, IRBTA. Whereas an 
alpha of 2% has been considered in IRBTC and 3% in IRBPA. No alpha has been 
considered in VK1 and MVR. 
e. Cost of Debt
• As per the Management, the actual average cost of debt for IRB InvIT Fund as on Valuation 
date is 8.0%. We have considered the same for our analysis.
f. Tax
• We understand that eventually all the SPVs will transition to the new tax regime once its 
MAT credit is exhausted, hence we have considered tax rate of 25.17% for the WACC. In 
case of the IRBTA and MVR where, the MAT credit is expected to be exhausted in the last 
year of the concession, a tax rate of 17.47% has been considered in accordance with the 
old Tax regime.
g. Capital structure
• To estimate an appropriate capital structure for the SPVs we have considered capital 
structure of comparable companies, IRB InvIT Fund’s actual capital structure and 
discussion with Management on long term view on normalized capital structure.
• The debt capitalization (based on market values) of publicly traded companies operating in 
a similar industry as the IRB InvIT Fund ranged from 11.3 per cent to 75.9 per cent of total 
capital with median of 52.2 per cent. Please refer to the next slide in this regard.
• The actual debt to capital for IRB InvIT Fund as on valuation date (based on market 
capitalization) stood at 61.4 per cent. However a discussed with Management, same was at 
elevated levels due to debt taken for a proposed transaction being contemplated to acquire 
new assets. 
• However, given that comparable companies have assets portfolio which is mix of 
operational and under-construction assets, We have also considered status of IRB InvIT 
Fund’s asset portfolio and borrowing capacity when determining where within the Industry 
debt level ranges to select. All assets of IRB InvIT Fund are completed and fully 
operational. Considering remaining concession life of BOT assets in IRB InvIT Fund’s 
portfolio and discussion with the Management on their long term view on normalized capital 
structure including refinancing capacity, We have estimated a normalized capital structure 
of 50 per cent debt and 50 per cent equity.
• In case of completed HAM assets, since the cash flows are less volatile and have very low 
risk, higher debt to capital structure is observed. Therefore, we have considered the debt to 
equity ratio for VK1 to be 70:30. 
WACC Indication
• Based on selected rate of return on equity, cost of debt and capital structure discussed 
above, we have calculated WACC for SPV’s to be in range of 7.7 per cent to 10.8 per cent.

WACC – Comparison between current and previous valuation
Source: KVSL analysis, Management Information and S&P Capital IQ
Rf Yield on government of India securities has decreased leading to the change if Rf presented above
Rm Equity risk premium has remained the same. However, there is an increase in Beta on account of changes in the market. Beta for VK1 has reduced as 
we have considered Quartile 1 of re-levered beta of comparable companies vis-à-vis median considered in previous valuation.
Debt to capital The debt to capital structure has remained unchanged.
Cost of Debt The Company’s cost of borrowing has improved due to reduction in interest rates and accordingly updated in the current WACC analysis.
WACC For BOT asset the cost of capital has gone down by 0.1% and for VK1 the cost of Capital has gone down by 0.4% driven by reduction in cost of debt.

Key Assumptions
Source(s): Management information
a. Modification in concession period
• As per Clause 29.2 of the concession agreement between NHAI and IRBJD, “In the event 
actual average traffic shall have fallen short of the target traffic, then for every 1% shortfall 
as compared to the target traffic, the concession period shall, subject to payment of 
concession fee in accordance with this agreement, be increased by 1.5% thereof; provided 
such increase in concession period shall not in any case exceed 20% of the concession 
period”.
• Traffic sampling has been conducted in year 2017, 2018 and 2019. Actual Traffic sampled 
was 45.25% short than Target Traffic specified in the Concession Agreement. Since the 
agreement caps the extension to 20%, the maximum allowable extension to concession 
period was granted, which is 5 years (i.e. 1,826 days). NHAI has approved the extension 
vide letter dated 18 March 2020. 
• Besides the extension mentioned in the agreement, Management represented that the 
concession period will be increased by further 107 days on account of covid-19 and another 
24 days on account of demonetization. 
• Accordingly, the Management has confirmed to us to consider revised concession period till 
21 October 2040. Thus, the explicit period for the current valuation analysis exercise has 
been considered from 1 October 2025 to 21 October 2040.
b. Revenue
• Revenue for IRBJD is derived from Toll collections for the concession period. Management 
has provided Traffic volume, toll rates and toll revenue for the forecast period based on the 
traffic report prepared by independent consultant in November 2025.
• As stated in the Traffic Study Report of IRBJD, elasticity model of growth projection has 
been considered for traffic forecast. While estimating traffic volume, consultant has 
considered factors such as GDP growth rate of India, developments along the project road, 
elasticity value of different vehicle type for computing the traffic growth rate.
• Basis above factors, Traffic is forecast to increase in range of 4-6 per cent annually initially 
and stepped down for future years.
• Annual revision of toll rate for the forecast period shall be in accordance with National 
Highway Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008 and amendment thereto. 
• Additionally, the applicable base rate shall be revised annually on April 1 to reflect the fixed 
increase of 3 per cent plus increase in wholesale price index (“WPI”) but such revision shall 
be restricted to 40% of the increase in WPI on overall basis during the concession period. 
As given in the traffic report, average inflation in WPI from FY2005-24 is c.5%. Considering 
the same, WPI has been projected to grow by 5% till FY28 and by 4.5 per cent thereafter.
• Toll revenue has been considered basis the pessimistic scenario from the traffic report 
prepared by an independent consultant appointed by the Management. 
• As per the NHAI Circular No. 17.7.12/2025 dated 17 October 2025, the Ministry of Road 
Transport & Highways (MoRTH), vide Gazette Notification No. 388 (E) dated 17 June 2025, 
has inserted sub-section (3B) in Rule 9 of the National Highways Fee (Determination of 
Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008, thereby introducing the concept of an Annual Pass with 
effect from 15 August 2025. MoRTH vide Circular No. H-25011/05/2025-Toll (E-245443) 
dated 1 September 2025 has notified a fair compensation framework for addressing 
revenue losses arising out of the Annual Pass in InvIT Projects.
• The impact of Annual Pass has been considered by the traffic consultant in the traffic study 
while estimating toll revenue for the forecast period.
c. Operating expenses
• Operational expenditure includes base operating expenditure, admin expenses, insurance, 
project management fees and various other expenses. These are broadly categorized as 
routine maintenance expenses and other operating expenses.
• Periodic maintenance expense, also referred to as major maintenance expenses are 
incurred to restore the road asset to its original condition or to maintain its current operating 
standard.
• Upto FY2030, IRBJD has entered into a fixed price Project Implementation Agreement 
(“PIA”) for periodic and routine maintenance with IRB Infrastructure Developers Limited 
(“Project Manager”).

Key Assumptions
Source(s): Management information
• Operating expenses for the forecast period post FY2030, routine and periodic maintenance 
expense and other operating expenses, have been forecast by the Management and 
reviewed by independent technical consultant to ensure that the estimates are reasonable. 
• Other operating expenses are estimated to increase by ~8 per cent in the forecast period.
d. Depreciation & amortization
• Management has provided the forecast depreciation on assets. Management has forecast 
depreciation to increase in line with the increase in revenue.
e. Tax
• Management represented that IRBJD is eligible to claim Tax benefit under section 80IA of 
Income Tax,1961 from FY2026 to FY2033 and the same has been considered while 
calculating forecast tax outflows along with any carried forward business loss and 
unabsorbed depreciation. The SPV will initially pay tax under MAT and gradually shift to the 
new regime of income tax once its MAT credit is exhausted. 
f. Working capital
• The change is WC each year is not material. Therefore, we have only considered the 
impact of release of working capital at the end of the concession period. 
g. Capex
• Since the SPV is already operational, there is no capex to be incurred in the remainder of 
the concession period. 
h. Changes in assumption 
• Toll revenue have been updated basis the report prepared by independent consultant in 
November 2025. Forecast Toll revenue has increased by ~1% primarily due to revision in 
forecast traffic because of actual traffic observed in half year ended 30 September 2025.

such increase in concession period shall not in any case exceed 20% of the concession 
period”.
• Traffic sampling has been conducted in year 2018 and 2020. Actual Traffic sampled was 
27% short than Target Traffic specified in the Concession Agreement. Since the agreement 
caps the extension to 20%, the maximum allowable extension to concession period was 
granted, which is 4 years (i.e. 1,460 days). NHAI has approved the extension vide letter 
dated 5 March 2021.
• Besides the extension mentioned in the agreement, Management presented that the 
concession period will be increased by 90 days on account of covid-19, 24 days on account 
of demonetization, and 467 days on account of farmer’s protest. Further, Management has 
sought an additional extension of 27 days due to farmers protest in FY25.
• Additionally, IRBPA has sought further extension of 518 days due to delay in completion of 
construction of the project on account of reasons not attributable to IRBPA. However, the 
matter is under litigation as on Valuation date. Management has considered 518 days of 
extension in concession period. 
• However, the matter is under litigation as on Valuation date. To account for uncertainty 
associated with this assumption, We have considered higher Alpha in WACC calculation for 
IRBPA.
• Accordingly, the Management has confirmed to us to consider revised concession period is 
till 29 January 2038. Thus, the explicit period for the current valuation analysis exercise has 
been considered from 1 October 2025 to 29 January 2038.
b. Revenue
• Revenue for IRBPA is derived from Toll collections for the concession period. Management 
has provided Traffic volume, toll rates and toll revenue for the forecast period based on the 
traffic report prepared by independent consultant in November 2025.
• As stated in the Traffic Study Report of IRBPA, elasticity model of growth projection has 
been considered for traffic forecast. While estimating traffic volume, consultant has 
considered factors such as GDP growth rate of India, developments along the project road, 
elasticity value of different vehicle type for computing the traffic growth rate.
• Further, the traffic consultant has also considered positive impact of alignment the IRBPA 
project road with the proposed Delhi Amritsar Katra Expressway and is expected to be 
completed in FY2030 leading to higher growth in toll revenue estimate in FY30 and FY31.  
• Basis above factors, Traffic is forecast to increase in range of 3-6 per cent annually initially 
and suitably stepped down in forecast and a one-time increase of additional ~3 per cent in 
FY30 and FY31. 
• Annual revision of toll rate for the forecast period shall be in accordance with National 
Highway Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008 and amendment thereto.
• Additionally, the applicable base rate shall be revised annually on April 1 to reflect the fixed 
increase of 3 per cent plus the increase in wholesale price index (“WPI”) but such revision 
shall be restricted to 40% of the increase in WPI on overall basis during the concession 
period. As given in the traffic report, average inflation in WPI from FY2005-24 is c.5%. 
Considering the same, WPI has been projected to grow by 5% till FY28 and by 4.5 per cent 
thereafter.
• Toll revenue has been considered basis the pessimistic scenario from the traffic report 
prepared by an independent consultant appointed by the Management.

Key Assumptions
Source(s): Management information
• As per the NHAI Circular No. 17.7.12/2025 dated 17 October 2025, the Ministry of Road 
Transport & Highways (MoRTH), vide Gazette Notification No. 388 (E) dated 17 June 2025, 
has inserted sub-section (3B) in Rule 9 of the National Highways Fee (Determination of 
Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008, thereby introducing the concept of an Annual Pass with 
effect from 15 August 2025. MoRTH vide Circular No. H-25011/05/2025-Toll (E-245443) 
dated 1 September 2025 has notified a fair compensation framework for addressing 
revenue losses arising out of the Annual Pass in InvIT Projects.
• The impact of Annual Pass has been considered by the traffic consultant in the traffic study 
while estimating toll revenue for the forecast period.
c. Periodic maintenance & routine maintenance costs
• Operational expenditure includes base operating expenditure, admin expenses, insurance, 
project management fees and various other expenses. These are broadly categorized as 
routine maintenance expenses and other operating expenses.
• Periodic maintenance expense, also referred to as major maintenance expenses are 
incurred to restore the road asset to its original condition or to maintain its current operating 
standard.
• Upto FY2030, IRBPA has entered into a fixed price Project Implementation Agreement for 
periodic and routine maintenance with IRB Infrastructure Developers Limited (“Project 
Manager”). 
• Operating expenses for the forecast period post FY2030, routine and periodic maintenance 
expense and other operating expenses, have been forecast by the Management and 
reviewed by independent technical consultant to ensure that the estimates are reasonable. 
• Other operating expenses are estimated to increase by ~8 per cent in the forecast period.
d. Depreciation & amortization
• Forecasted depreciation on assets has been provided by the Management. Management 
has forecasted depreciation to increase in line with the increase in revenue.
e. Tax
• Management represented that IRBPA is eligible to claim Tax benefit under section 80IA of 
Income Tax,1961 from FY2026 to FY2034 and the same has been considered while 
calculating forecast tax outflows along with any carried forward business loss and 
unabsorbed depreciation. The SPV will initially pay tax under MAT and gradually shift to the 
new regime of income tax once its MAT credit is exhausted. 
f. Working capital
• The change is WC each year is not material. Therefore, we have only considered the 
impact of release of working capital at the end of the concession period. 
g. Capex
• Since the SPV is already operational, there is no capex to be incurred in the remainder of 
the concession period. 
h. Changes in assumption 
• Toll revenue have been updated basis the report prepared by independent consultant in 
November 2025. Forecast Toll revenue has reduced by ~3% primarily due to revision in 
forecast traffic because of actual traffic observed in half year ended 30 September 2025.

Key Assumptions
Source(s): Management information
a. Modification in concession period
• As per Clause 29.2 of the concession agreement between NHAI and IRBTA, “In the event 
actual average traffic shall have fallen short of the target traffic, then for every 1% shortfall 
as compared to the target traffic, the concession period shall, subject to payment of 
concession fee in accordance with this agreement, be increased by 1.5% thereof; provided 
such increase in concession period shall not in any case exceed 20% of the concession 
period”.
• Traffic sampling has been conducted in year 2019, 2020 and 2021. Actual Traffic sampled 
was 46% short than Target Traffic specified in the Concession Agreement. Since the 
agreement caps the extension to 20%, the maximum allowable extension to concession 
period has been considered, which is 4.4 years (i.e. 1, 606 days). NHAI approval on this 
extension is yet to be received.
• Besides the extension mentioned in the agreement, Management represented that the 
concession period will be increased by further 103 days on account of covid-19 and another 
24 days on account of demonetization. 
• Accordingly, the Management has confirmed to us to consider revised concession period till 
2 June 2037. Thus, the explicit period for the current valuation analysis exercise has been 
considered from 1 October 2025 to 2 June 2037.
b. Revenue
• Revenue for IRBTA is derived from Toll collections for the concession period. Management 
has provided Traffic volume, toll rates and toll revenue for the forecast period based on the 
traffic report prepared by independent consultant in November 2025.
• As stated in the Traffic Study Report of IRBPA, elasticity model of growth projection has 
been considered for traffic forecast. While estimating traffic volume, consultant has 
considered factors such as GDP growth rate of India, developments along the project road, 
elasticity value of different vehicle type for computing the traffic growth rate.
• Basis above factors, Traffic is forecast to increase in range of 4-6 per cent annually initially 
and stepped down for future years. 
• Annual revision of toll rate for the forecast period shall be in accordance with National 
Highway Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008 and amendment thereto. 
Additionally, the applicable base rate shall be revised annually on April 1 to reflect the Karta 
fixed increase of 3 per cent plus increase in wholesale price index (“WPI”) but such revision 
shall be restricted to 40% of the increase in WPI on overall basis during the concession 
period. As given in the traffic report, average inflation in WPI from FY2005-24 is c.5%. 
Considering the same, WPI has been projected to grow by 5% till FY28 and by 4.5 per cent 
thereafter.
• Toll revenue has been considered basis the pessimistic scenario from the traffic report 
prepared by an independent consultant appointed by the Management.
• As per the NHAI Circular No. 17.7.12/2025 dated 17 October 2025, the Ministry of Road

dated 1 September 2025 has notified a fair compensation framework for addressing 
revenue losses arising out of the Annual Pass in InvIT Projects.
• The impact of Annual Pass has been considered by the traffic consultant in the traffic study 
while estimating toll revenue for the forecast period.
c. Periodic maintenance & routine maintenance costs
• Operational expenditure includes base operating expenditure, admin expenses, insurance, 
project management fees and various other expenses. These are broadly categorized as

• Periodic maintenance expense, also referred to as major maintenance expenses are 
incurred to restore the road asset to its original condition or to maintain its current operating 
standard.

independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee. All righ ts

Key Assumptions
Source(s): Management information
a. Modification in concession period
• As per Clause 29.2 of the concession agreement between NHAI and IRBTC, “In the event 
actual average traffic shall have fallen short of the target traffic, then for every 1% shortfall 
as compared to the target traffic, the concession period shall, subject to payment of 
concession fee in accordance with this agreement, be increased by 1.5% thereof; provided 
such increase in concession period shall not in any case exceed 20% of the concession 
period”.
• Traffic sampling has been conducted in year 2019, 2020 and 2021. Actual Traffic sampled 
was 25% short than Target Traffic specified in the Concession Agreement. Since the 
agreement caps the extension to 20%, the maximum allowable extension to concession 
period has been considered, which is 5.2 years (i.e. 1,899 days). NHAI Approval on this 
extension is yet to be received.
• Besides the extension mentioned in the agreement, Management represented that the 
concession period will be increased by further 111 days on account of covid-19 and further 
24 days on account of demonetization.
• Accordingly, the Management has confirmed to us to consider revised concession period till 
29 December 2042. Thus, the explicit period for the current valuation analysis exercise has 
been considered from 1 October 2025 to 29 December 2042. 
b. Revenue
• Revenue for IRBTC is derived from Toll collections for the concession period. Management 
has provided Traffic volume, toll rates and toll revenue for the forecast period based on the 
traffic report prepared by independent consultant in November 2025.
• As stated in the Traffic Study Report of IRBTC, elasticity model of growth projection has 
been considered for traffic forecast. While estimating traffic volume, consultant has 
considered factors such as GDP growth rate of India, developments along the project road, 
elasticity value of different vehicle type for computing the traffic growth rate.
• Basis above factors, Traffic is forecast to increase in range of 4-5 per cent annually initially 
and stepped down for future years. 
• Annual revision of toll rate for the forecast period shall be in accordance with National 
Highway Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008 and amendment thereto 
Additionally, the applicable base rate shall be revised annually on April 1 to reflect the Karta 
fixed increase of 3 per cent plus increase in wholesale price index (“WPI”) but such revision 
shall be restricted to 40% of the increase in WPI on overall basis during the concession 
period. As given in the traffic report, average inflation in WPI from FY2005-25 is c.5%. 
Considering the same, WPI has been projected to grow by 5% till FY28 and by 4.5 per cent 
thereafter.
• Toll revenue has been considered basis the pessimistic scenario from the traffic report 
prepared by an independent consultant appointed by the Management. Further, IRBTC 
also collects toll for an additional 13 km stretch. The revenue pertaining to this is 
transferred to NHAI after deducting 3 per cent as collection charges. Therefore, this 
additional toll is a pass through cashflow and collection charges are considered other 
operating income in our analysis which is forming part of revenue.
• As per the NHAI Circular No. 17.7.12/2025 dated 17 October 2025, the Ministry of Road 
Transport & Highways (MoRTH), vide Gazette Notification No. 388 (E) dated 17 June 2025, 
has inserted sub-section (3B) in Rule 9 of the National Highways Fee (Determination of 
Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008, thereby introducing the concept of an Annual Pass with 
effect from 15 August 2025. MoRTH vide Circular No. H-25011/05/2025-Toll (E-245443) 
dated 1 September 2025 has notified a fair compensation framework for addressing 
revenue losses arising out of the Annual Pass in InvIT Projects.
• The impact of Annual Pass has been considered by the traffic consultant in the traffic study 
while estimating toll revenue for the forecast period.
c. Premium payable
• The premium payable to NHAI is considered and corroborated from the concession 
agreement as given by the Management.

Key Assumptions
Source(s): Management information
d. Periodic maintenance & routine maintenance costs
• Operational expenditure includes base operating expenditure, admin expenses, insurance, 
project management fees and various other expenses. These are broadly categorized as 
routine maintenance expenses and other operating expenses.
• Periodic maintenance expense, also referred to as major maintenance expenses are 
incurred to restore the road asset to its original condition or to maintain its current operating 
standard.
• Upto FY2030, IRBTC has entered into a fixed price Project Implementation Agreement 
(“PIA”) for periodic and routine maintenance with IRB Infrastructure Developers Limited 
(“Project Manager”). 
• Operating expenses for the forecast period post FY2030, routine and periodic maintenance 
expense and other operating expenses, have been forecast by the Management and 
reviewed by independent technical consultant to ensure that the estimates are reasonable. 
• Other operating expenses are estimated to increase by ~6 per cent in the forecast period.
e. Depreciation & Amortization
• Forecasted depreciation on assets has been provided by the Management. Management 
has forecasted depreciation to increase in line with the increase in revenue.
f. Tax
• Management represented that IRBTC is eligible to claim tax benefits under section 80IA of 
Income Tax Act, 1961 from FY2026 to FY2031 and the same has been considered while 
calculating forecast tax outflows along with any carried forward business loss and 
unabsorbed depreciation. The SPV will initially pay tax under MAT and gradually shift to the 
new regime of income tax once its MAT credit is exhausted. 
g. Working capital
• The change is WC each year is not material. Therefore, we have only considered the 
impact of release of working capital at the end of the concession period. 
h. Capex
• Since the SPV is already operational, there is no capex to be incurred in the remainder of 
the concession 
i. Deferment of Premium
• Due to inadequate cashflows, IRBTC had made an application under Scheme of Deferment 
Premium issued by Ministry of Road and Transport Highways vide letter No. NH-
37012/22/2011-H dated 04 March 2014. The application was granted on 06 June 2014. 
Accordingly, premium deferment was granted for a period of 10 years starting from FY2015 
as per the schedule given in the adjacent table:
• As per the terms of the premium deferment approval letter, deferred premium has been 
allowed to be deferred over concession period at an interest rate at 2% above the Bank 
Rate. 
• As on Valuation Date, Management has represented that IRBTC has INR 741 cr 
outstanding as Deferred premium (including accumulated interest of INR 336 cr on the 
deferred premium). 
• Given this understanding, We have relied on Management assumptions to consider 
payment of deferred premium to the extent of available cashflows and Interest on deferred 
premium has been considered at 7.75% for the forecast period.

Key Assumptions
Source(s): Management information
j. Changes in assumption 
• Toll revenue have been updated basis the report prepared by independent consultant in 
November 2025. Forecast Toll revenue has increased by ~1% primarily due to revision in 
forecast traffic because of actual traffic observed in half year ended 30 September 2025.
• Interest rate on deferred premium has reduced to 7.75% from 8.25% due to reduction in 
bank rate.

independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee. All righ ts

Key Assumptions
Source(s): Management information
a. Modification in concession period
• The concession agreement does not have any provisions regarding the extension or 
reduction of the concession period.
• Management represented that the concession period will be increased by further 113 days 
on account of covid-19, 15 days on account of floods in Chennai and 24 days on account of 
demonetization.
• Accordingly, the Management has confirmed to us to consider revised concession period till 
12 January 2027. Thus, the explicit period for the current valuation analysis exercise has 
been considered from 1 October 2025 to 12 January 2027.
b. Revenue
• Revenue for MVR is derived from Toll collections for the concession period. Management 
has provided Traffic volume, toll rates and toll revenue for the forecast period based on the 
traffic report prepared by independent consultant in November 2025.
• As stated in the Traffic Study Report of MVR, elasticity model of growth projection has been 
considered for traffic forecast. While estimating traffic volume, consultant has considered 
factors such as GDP growth rate of India, developments along the project road, elasticity 
value of different vehicle type for computing the traffic growth rate.
• Basis above factors, Traffic is forecast to increase in range of 3-4 per cent for forecast 
period. 
• Traffic volume for the forecast period has been considered based on the traffic report 
prepared by an independent consultant in November 2025.
• Annual revision of toll rate for the forecast period shall be in accordance with Fee 
Notification. The applicable base rate shall be revised annually on September 1 to reflect 
the increase in wholesale price index (“WPI”). As given in the traffic report, WPI has been 
projected to grow by 5% for the forecast period.
• Pursuant to the terms of the Concession Agreement, consequent  to MVR being  handed 
over the Additional  Highway along  with the  revised  fees notification, MVR is  required  to 
pay  80.43%  of  the  additional  proportional  revenue  per  year  for  that  year  to NHAI for 
the entire remaining operations period.
• The additional proportional revenue per year is required to be computed  as  the  MVR  
Additional  Highway  length  multiplied  by  the  total  toll  collection  of  MVR  for  that 
accounting year divided by the MVR Project Highway length (including MVR Additional 
Highway length).
• Toll revenue has been considered basis the pessimistic scenario from the traffic report 
prepared by an independent consultant appointed by the Management net of NHAI share in 
revenue for additional highway.
• As per the NHAI Circular No. 17.7.12/2025 dated 17 October 2025, the Ministry of Road 
Transport & Highways (MoRTH), vide Gazette Notification No. 388 (E) dated 17 June 2025, 
has inserted sub-section (3B) in Rule 9 of the National Highways Fee (Determination of 
Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008, thereby introducing the concept of an Annual Pass with 
effect from 15 August 2025. MoRTH vide Circular No. H-25011/05/2025-Toll (E-245443) 
dated 1 September 2025 has notified a fair compensation framework for addressing 
revenue losses arising out of the Annual Pass in InvIT Projects.
• The impact of Annual Pass has been considered by the traffic consultant in the traffic study 
while estimating toll revenue for the forecast period.
c. Operating Expenses
• Routine maintenance and other operating expenses are based fixed price Project 
implementation Agreement with IRB Infrastructure Developers Limited till FY2027.
d. Depreciation & Amortization
• Forecasted depreciation on assets has been provided by the Management. Management 
has forecasted depreciation to increase in line with the increase in revenue.

Key Assumptions
Source(s): Management information
e. Tax
• Management represented that MVR is eligible to claim Tax benefit under section 80IA of 
Income Tax,1961 from FY2026 to FY2027 and the same has been considered while 
calculating forecast tax outflows along with any carried forward business loss and 
unabsorbed depreciation. Based on the current forecast, the SPV will pay tax under MAT 
for the balance of the concession period.
f. Working capital
• The change is WC each year is not material. Therefore, we have only considered the 
impact of release of working capital at the end of the concession period. 
g. Capex
• Since the SPV is already operational, there is no capex to be incurred in the remainder of 
the concession period. 
h. Changes in assumption 
• No material change in forecast assumption from previous valuation exercise

Key Assumptions
Source: Management Information
a. Payment of bid project cost
• As per Clause 23 of the concession agreement;
a) 40% of the bid project cost (Also known as “NHAI support”) adjusted for 
price index multiple shall be due and payable to the Concessionaire in 5 
equal instalments of 8% each during the Construction period on milestone 
basis. Construction of the highway has been completed and the COD has 
been achieved hence, the entire NHAI  support has been paid to VK1.
b) The balance bid project cost shall be due and payable in 30 biannual 
instalments from 180th day of COD (“Annuity payments”) during the 15 years 
of Operation period. Each such annuity is a fixed percentage of the 
completion cost remaining to be paid on COD.
b. Revenue
• Revenue forecast for VK1 comprises of Annuity receivable from NHAI, interest on 
annuity and O&M Support receivable from NHAI.
• As per information provided by the Management, we understand that VK1 has 
received payments for 6 annuity installments and 7th installment (including interest) 
was due on 29 September 2025 has been received in October 2025. Since 7th 
installment has been received after valuation date, we have separately added value of 
the annuity in the Enterprise Value of VK1. 
• Balance annuity of INR 1,086 cr (excluding GST) is forecast to be received over next 
11.5 years in 23 bi-annual installments.
c. Interest on Annuity
• Each of the biannual instalments payable above shall be paid along with interest at a 
rate of applicable bank rate plus 3 %. Thus, interest on annuity has been considered at 
8.75 per cent (5.75 per cent Bank Rate plus 3 per cent).
d. Periodic and routine maintenance payments by Authority
O&M expenses shall be borne by NHAI and a lump sum financial support in the form 
of biannual payments shall be due and payable by NHAI to VK1. This shall be 
computed on INR 2.7 Cr. Thus, O&M payments by Authority have been considered 
accordingly by adjusting for price index multiple by 5 per cent p.a..
e. O&M Cots
• O&M cost is based on the fixed price Project Implementation Agreement with IRB Infrastructure 
Developers Limited till FY2037.
f. Depreciation & amortisation
• Amortization has been considered based on intangible asset model where the capital cost net of 
NHAI support is depreciated at 25 per cent over the operational period.
g. Tax
• Management represented that the VK1 has adopted the new tax regime. Thus, tax outflows for 
the forecast have been calculated based on the new regime of income tax. Carried forward 
business loss and unabsorbed depreciation if any has been considered while calculating tax 
outflows.
h. Capex
• Construction of the highway has been completed. Hence, no major capex cost needs to be 
incurred.
i. Working capital
• The change is WC in first three forecast years represent utilization of GST credit against GST 
payable on annuity receipts. Thereafter, we have only considered the impact of release of 
working capital at the end of the concession period. 
j. Changes in assumption 
• Interest rate on annuity have reduced to 8.75 per cent annum due to reduction in bank rate.

⚫ Financial projections of SPV’s, Investment Manager fee, DSRA requirement from 1 October 2025 till the end of the concession period of the respective SPV’s 
⚫ Other data for all the SPVs which is as follows – 
• Concession Agreements

⚫ NHAI letters for modification of concession period for IRBJD and IRBPA.
⚫ Letter from the SPV to NHAI for modification of concession period in accordance with terms of concession agreement for IRBTC and IRBTA.
⚫ Management has provided project completion cost certificate for VK1.
⚫ Management has provided Traffic consultant reports prepared by GMD Consultants (appointed independently by Client) dated November 2025 for all the SPVs. Management has confirmed that 
the traffic studies shared are the most recent studies available. Forecast revenue has been considered from the aforesaid traffic study reports for each of the SPVs. We have compared the revenue 
considered in the forecast model with the revenue forecasted in the traffic study reports and noted that the Management has considered the pessimistic revenue scenario in their forecast. 
⚫ Management has informed that O&M for the SPVs projects would be done by IRBIDL based on fixed price contract. O&M payments are fixed for the contract period till FY2030 for IRBJD, IRBPA, 
IRBTA and IRBTC, FY2027 for MVR and FY2037 for VK1 after which terms of the contract may get renegotiated upon renewal. Management has shared extract of the contract and we have 
validated forecasted periodic and routine maintenance expense for contract period from the same. For the forecast period post the contract period O&M has been considered based on the 
technical feasibility study conducted by the external third party. We have gone ahead with Management assumption on O&M cost. Given the technical nature of this study, review of the same is not 
part of our scope of work.

Annexure 1: Sources of Information (2/2) 
⚫ The investment management fees is computed assuming 1% of net Toll Revenue with a floor of INR 10 Crore and a Cap of INR 25 Crore per annum which is in line with agreement between Fund 
and Investment manager. 
⚫ Management represented that due to covid 19 the concession period end dates across all BOT SPVs increased by 90-113 days pursuant to notification no F.18/4/2020-PPD dated 13th May 2020 
and Notification no. Covid-19/Roadmap/JS(H)/2020 dated 26th August 2021. Concession period of IRBPA in addition to covid 19 increase, increased by further 494 days due to farmer agitations on 
its route. Apart from this, concession period is increased by 24 days for all BOT SPVs due to demonetization.
⚫ Management has considered 518 days of extension in concession period for IRBPA due to delay in completion of construction for reasons not attributable to IRBPA. However, the NHAI has 
challenged the extension of 518 days and the matter is still under litigation. Based on this representation from Management, we have considered 518 days of extension in concession period in our 
analysis. We have considered higher alpha for IRBPA to account for uncertainty associated with extension of concession period.
⚫ Given the nature of the liability, capital creditors of INR 17 Cr outstanding in the books of the SPVs have been considered debt like in nature and adjusted from the Enterprise Value to arrive at the 
Equity Value of IRB InvIT Fund.
⚫ As per the NHAI Circular No. 17.7.12/2025 dated 17 October 2025, the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH), vide Gazette Notification No. 388 (E) dated 17 June 2025, has inserted 
sub-section (3B) in Rule 9 of the National Highways Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008, thereby introducing the concept of an Annual Pass with effect from 15 August 2025. 
MoRTH vide Circular No. H-25011/05/2025-Toll (E-245443) dated 1 September 2025 has notified a fair compensation framework for addressing revenue losses arising out of the Annual Pass in 
InvIT Projects. The impact of Annual Pass has been considered by the traffic consultant in the traffic study while estimating toll revenue for the forecast period.
⚫ Besides the above, there may be other information provided by the Management which may not have been perused by us in any detail, if not considered relevant for our defined scope. 
⚫ In addition to the above, we have also obtained such other information and explanations from the Management, either verbally or in written form, as were considered relevant for the purpose of the 
valuation. We had discussions with the key members of the Management; 
⚫ The following external sources were used in the preparation of the report:

UPDATE ON TOLL REVENUE AND O&M COST PROJECTION REPORT 
 
Four - Laning of Jaipur - Deoli Section of NH-12from Km 18.700 to Km 165.000 
CHAPTER 1  
INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
The Government of India through National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) 
embarked upon a program to enhance the traffic capacity and safety for efficient 
transportation of goods as well as passenger traffic on National Highway Sections 
under NHDP Phase V. Under Phase V NHAI has planned to convert 6,500 km of 
existing 4-lane National Highways into 6-lane National Highway. Sections envisaged 
under 6-laning comprise the Golden Quadrilateral section (5,700 km) and some other 
sections which are 800 km in length. 
The project under consideration, Jaipur - Deoli section of NH-12 from Km 18.700 to 
km 165.000 is one such road project NHAI intended to implement on a BOT basis in 
the DBFOT format. M/s IRB Jaipur Deoli Tollway Ltd . (Concessionaire) has been 
awarded the Project for concession period of 25 years starting from 14 th June 2010 to 
13th June 2035. The Project has been commissioned and is currently in the operation / 
maintenance phase. 
    Asset and regional context 
The Asset is 146 kms long four lanes national highway located in the state of 
Rajasthan, connecting Jaipur in the north to Deoli in the south via Tonk. The Asset 
was awarded on June 2010 and followed by Full COD in April 2016 and scheduled 
end of concession period in June 2035 and we understand that there has been an 
extension of 5 years on the Asset and the new concession end date is 21st Oct 2040. 
 
The Asset is part of NH52, being the fourth longest National highway in India, on a 
national level it starts from Sangrur in Punjab and terminates in Ankola, Karnataka. It 
traverses through the major cities like Sangrur, Hisar, Sikar, Jaipur, Deoli, Kota, 
Biora, Dewas, Aurangabad and Belagavi, and the Asset is the section of the NH52 
corridor, and it connects the Jaipur with Deoli, Kota and provides trips an access to 
Madhya Pradesh that is Biora, Dewas, Indore etc. 
 
The Jaipur -Deoli section of NH52 is a 146 km four -lane road. It serves as a key 
connector for both long - and short -distance travel between the northern states of 
Punjab and Haryana and the states of Rajasthan and MP (connecting cities like Indore

and Jaipur) and Gujarat. It also facilitates short -distance travel between Jaipur, Deoli, 
Tonk, and Kota. 
 
The Asset consists of two toll plazas – Barkheda (located closer to Jaipur), and 
Sonwa (closer to Deoli). The distance between the two toll plazas is 83.5 km. Of the 
two plazas on this Asset, the Barkheda toll plaza caters to a higher volume of total 
traffic due to its proximity to the urban cluster of Jaipur. TP1 Barkheda is located 30 
kms south of Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan and one of India’s most prominent 
tourist destinations. Further, TP1 Barkheda is located 6 kms south of the Jaipur Ring 
Road, highlighting the local characteristics of this plaza. 
 
In contrast, TP2 Sonwa toll plaza is located 60 kms north of Deoli, which serves as 
the agricultural backbone for local villages in the region. The two toll plazas exhibit 
distinct differences in terms of traffic volume and composition. 
Traffic at TP1 Barkheda toll plaza is observed to consist predominantly of short - and 
medium-distance journeys. This is attributed to its proximity to Jaipur, with 
passenger vehicles frequently traveling for tourism and educational purposes. Heavy 
commercial vehicles primarily cater to construction materials, such as sand (Bajri) 
and aggregates destined to Jaipur and North. Long-distance traffic, on the other hand, 
carries commodities like parcels, manufactured goods, pipes, LPG, and petroleum. 
FASTag penetration is high, with 85 -90% at TP1 Barkheda toll plaza and 90 -95% at 
TP2 Sonva toll plaza. Most vehicles at TP1 Barkheda toll plaza were observed to be 
travelling short distances, while at TP2 Sonva toll plaza, trips are primarily long -
distance. Consequently, the proportion of single trips reported at TP2 Sonva is higher 
compared to TP1 Barkheda, which sees a greater share of return tickets due to its 
proximity to Jaipur. 
1.2 Objective of the Study 
M/s IRB INVIT FUND has engaged GMD Consultants to assess the future traffic and 
toll potential of the project along with related operation & maintenance expenditure 
involved. 
This report named as “Toll Revenue and O&M Cost Projection  Report” mainly 
focuses on traffic and O&M aspects of the project. Other parameters like competing 
road, area developments etc. have been considered from a traffic development point 
of view.

1.2.1 Scope of Services 
The broad scope of work covered in the assignment is as follows: 
a) Analysis of Traffic Growth 
b) Toll Rate Growth 
c) Revenue Forecasting 
d) Operation and Maintenance Cost Projections 
The Concessionaire has provided basic historical traffic data and other project details 
on the basis of which the above analysis has been carried out , after applying our 
judgment to the traffic estimates.  
“Toll Revenue and O&M Cost Projection Report” was submitted in March 2017. In 
this report traffic data for the year  2015-16 was used as base traffic. The report was 
updated based on traffic data for the year 2017-18 and submitted in April 2018. The 
report was further updated with traffic Data of the period  from April 2018 to 
September 2018 and was submitted in October 2018. A revised report was submitted 
with updated traffic for the years  2018-19 in April 2019. The report  was further 
updated with yearly traffic data for 2019-20 in May 2020. With traffic data from 
April 2020 to March 2021 report was updated, report was further updated with yearly 
traffic data from April 2021 to March 2022, April 2022 to March 2023, April 2023 to 
March 2024, April 2024 to March 2025 and now concessionaire has provided  traffic 
data from April 2025 to September 2025, report is updated with this annual traffic 
data.

CHAPTER 2  
TRAFFIC SURVEYS AND ANALYSIS 
2.1 Traffic Surveys 
In the course of our work, we have collected the required information for project corridor 
to understand the general traffic and travel characteristics of the corridor.  
The following traffic data has been collected for project:  
• Classified traffic volume counts at the two toll plaza locations on Jaipur-Deoli 
section of NH -12 for base year 2015 -16, 2016-17, 2017 , 2017, 2017 -18, 
2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21, 2021-22, 2022-23, 2023-24,2024-25 and annual 
traffic data from April 2025 to September 2025. 
• Local Component of traffic 
• Component of Return Journey 
• Component of Monthly Pass Journey 
 
The main objective of the traffic data analysis is to: 
• Determine the existing traffic movement characteristics of the project.  
• Establish base year traffic. 
• Identification of travel patterns and modal split of project traffic  
• Deriving growth factors for traffic forecasting 
• Estimation of corridor traffic including traffic diversion if any 
• Preparation of revenue model and projection of revenue as per toll policy for 
various scenarios 
The p roject can be divided into two homogenous sections from a traffic  point of 
view.  
These sections can be:  
1. Jaipur to Tonk 
2. Tonk to Deoli 
Traffic of both sections is represented by toll plaza in each section. The table below 
provides details of locations from where traffic details have been collected:

2.2 Classified Traffic Volume Count 
The objective of conducting a Classified Traffic Volume Count is to understand the 
traffic flow pattern including modal split on a roadway. The Classified Traffic Volume 
Count survey has been provided by concessionaire of project highway from actual 
traffic data gathered at toll plaza locations based on monthly data shared with NHAI. 
These locations are indicated in Figure 2-1 and listed in Table 2-1.  
The vehicles can broadly be classified into fast moving / motorized and slow moving 
/ non-motorized vehicles, which can be further classified into specific categories of 
vehicles. The groupings of vehicles are further segregated to capture the tollable 
vehicle categories specifically and toll exempted vehicles are counted separately. The 
detailed vehicle classification system as per IRC: 64-1990 is given in the table below.

However, since the project highway is currently under toll operation, the data 
collected corresponds to the category of tollable vehicles. Following are the types of 
vehicles as per concession agreement:  
• Car / Jeep / van 
• Minibus /LCV 
• Truck / Bus 
• Multi Axle 
• Oversize Vehicle 
2.3 Traffic Characteristic 
Toll revenue of the project highway does not solely depend on traffic volume. There 
are certain characteristics of traffic which have significant potential to affect toll 
revenue. Components of local traffic, components of passenger and commercial 
traffic, portion of return journey traffic, portion of monthly pass traffic are some such 
characteristics of traffic. These will be discussed in subsequent sections of this report. 
2.3.1 Traffic Data 
Project concessionaire has provided Traffic data for base years 2015 -16, 2016 -17 
2017-18, 2018 -19, 2019 -20, 2020 -21, 2021 -22,2022-23,2023-24,2024-25 & traffic

Since the traffic data available for this update is for only Annual, from April 2025 to 
September 2025, it may not represent the whole year traffic. Hence a seasonality 
factor for balance part of year has been applied to average traffic of the current Six 
months to arrive at Annual Average Daily Traffic of base year 2025 -26. Thus, 
corrected traffic is used for future projections and revenue calculations. The 
following table shows historical traffic on project stretch and derived  Annual 
Average Daily Traffic (AADT) for year 2025-26.

2.4 Data Analysis 
2.4.1 Analysis of Traffic Volume Count 
Understanding the character of existing traffic forms the basis of traffic forecast. The 
various vehicle types having different sizes and characteristics can be converted into 
a single unit called Passenger Car Unit (PCU). Passenger Car equivalents for various 
vehicles are adopted based on recommendations of Indian Road Congress prescribed 
in “IRC -64-1990: Guidelines for Capacity of Roads in Rural areas”. The adopted 
passenger car unit values (PCU) are presented in Table 2-5.

It can be observed from above that project traffic has a PCU index ranging from 1.5 
to 2.4. 
which indicates a good mix of commercial and passenger traffic. 
2.4.2 Components of Traffic 
As discussed previously, components of traffic volume play an important role in 
determining project revenue. A larger component of commercial traffic with higher

TOLL REVENUE AND O&M COST PROJECTION REPORT 
 
Four - Laning of Jaipur - Deoli Section of NH-12 from Km 18.700 to Km 165.000 
axle configuration adds to project revenue positively. Similarly, a larger component 
of local traffic affects the project revenue potential negatively. 
For the purpose of analysis, the recent yearly traffic numbers for the year 2025-26 
have been considered as the base numbers. 
It is observed that c ar traffic forms  76% of total traffic at to ll plaza location 30.5 
while multi axle vehicles are 12% of total traffic . 8% of traffic is Truck /Bus while  
LCV traffic forms the balance 4%. Overall, about 24% of traf fic is commercial in 
nature. 
At toll plaza lo cation 105.00 car traffic forms 56% of total traffic at toll plaza while 
multi axle and LCV are 28% and 5%. Truck/ Bus volume is 1 1% of the total traffic. 
Overall, about 44% of traffic is commercial in nature  which is higher as compared to 
toll plaza location 30.5. 
Another important bifurcation of traffic is components of traffic with respect to 
various type of toll ticketing like 
1. Single Journey 
2. Return Journey 
3. Overweight Vehicles (Concessionaire provided special tariff for this category) 
4. Monthly Pass (Local and General) 
The following  table provides numbers of vehicles falling in each of the above  
categories on base year 2015 -16, 2016-17, 2017 -18, 2018-19, 2019-20 2020-21,

A significant part of the traffic at KM 30.5 00 is return journey  (52%) followed by 
single journey (35%), monthly passes which share 1% and Annual pass car is 12% of 
the total traffic volume. Overweight vehicle shares have reduced to almost nil. 
Similarly, traffic numbers for the type  of journey at KM 105.000 are given in the 
following table. 
Table 2-8 : Journey Type Bifurcation of Traffic at KM 105.000 
Here single journey ( 53%) forms the highest  portion of traffic followed by return 
journey (36%) monthly pass journey (0%) and Annual Pass car is (11%) . It can be 
observed as 105.000 is predominantly a rural part, monthly passes and return journey 
components have reduced as compared to location 30.5 00. Components of 
overweight vehicles remain the same though.

CHAPTER 3  
GROWTH OF TRAFFIC ON PROJECT HIGHWAY 
3.1 Introduction 
Traffic growth is a function of the interplay of a number of contributory factors such 
as National economy, Government policy, socio -economic conditions of the people, 
and changes in land uses along the project corridor precincts etc. As these factors 
have a number of uncertainties associated with them, forecasts of traffic are 
dependent on the forecasts of factors such as population, gross domestic product 
(GDP), vehicle ownership, per capita income (PCI), agricultural output, fuel 
consumption etc. Future patterns of change in these factors can be estimated with 
only a reasonable degree of accuracy and hence the resultant traffic forecast levels 
may not be precise.  
Traffic growth forecast for project corridor Jaipur – Deoli section of NH-12 has been 
done taking above factors into consideration. “IRC: 108 -2015-Guidelines for 
Traffic Prediction on Rural Highways ” is established best practice and has been 
used for traffic growth forecast. 
3.2 Trend Analysis 
One of the methods of estimation of future rate of traffic growth is to assume the 
same rate of growth as experienced in the past. However, it may be noted that major 
influencing factors which reflect Economic conditions such as GDP, agricultural 
output, industrial output, national policies etc. are susceptible to change over a longer 
period of time and necessary adjustments need to be made to past trends to account 
for these changes.  
Thus, we have considered the Elasticity model of growth projection which is one of 
the most widely acceptable methods for traffic forecast and is recommended in IRC: 
108-2015-Guidelines for Traffic Prediction on Rural Highways. 
In this method past trends of any vehicular data are paired with an economic 
indicator and a regression analysis is done to yield the economic model of growth. 
Growth of vehicle traffic varies for different types of vehicles. It is a proven fact that 
growth patterns for passenger and goods vehicles are different. Traffic growth on any 
highway typically depends on a number of economic parameters. The most 
important and direct parameters are given as below

• Per Capita Income  
• Net State Domestic Product (NSDP) 
• Population 
It is observed that the ownership of a car is more closely related to affordability 
hence per capita is the index which closely fits with growth of car traffic among 
other criteria. In similar fashion, the following pairs of vehicle type and independent 
variable can be established for elasticity modeling of growth. 
• Car / Jeep – Par Capita Income  
• Bus / Minibus – Population 
• Trucks / Heavy / Goods Vehicle – NSDP 
Time series data of vehicle (both passenger and goods) Registered in state of 
Rajasthan is used as the base data for analysis of growth. 
3.3 Estimation of Traffic Demand Elasticity 
The elasticity of traffic demand is defined as the rate at which traffic intensity varies 
due to change in the corresponding indicator selected. Hence, in order to estimate the 
elasticity of traffic demand, it is necessary to establish the relationship between the 
growth in number of given categories of vehicle with one of the economic variables 
considered, such as NSDP, per capita income and population growth. Latest  
available data for vehicle registration, per capita income, NSDP and population is 
used in analysis. 
As per IRC: 108 -2015 the model for estimating elasticity index for the project 
corridor is of the following form and is as given below: 
Log (P) =  k x Log (EI) + A 
Where,   
P = Number of Vehicles (Mode wise) 
EI  = Economic Indicator 
A = Regression constant  
k = Elasticity coefficient (Regression coefficient)  
The elasticity for cars and bus (passenger vehicles) is calculated based on the 
Population and Per Capita Domestic Product (PCDP) and the elasticity for trucks is 
calculated based on the Net State Domestic Product (NSDP). 
The following tables and graphs depict regression and elasticity of growth model.

Using the regression analysis above, we have arrived at the elasticity of traffic 
demand for each class of vehicle to a given change in relevant economic indicators. 
Average traffic growth of a vehicle class is multiplied by the corresponding elasticity 
coefficient to arrive at traffic growth. R2 is a statistical measure of how close the data 
are to the fitted regression line. It varies from 0 to 1. The higher the value of R2 more 
representative is the regression model of data.  
The results of these analyses for the good fit as reflected by R 2 values are presented 
in the Table below.

The economic  model for predicting growth is good tool, h owever other local, 
regional, national factors should also be considered before finalizing growth factors. 
Considering factors such as proposed developments and other influencing economic 
factors, moderate growth should be considered. These factors are discussed in 
subsequent sections. 
3.4 Analysis of Historic Traffic Data 
Historic traffic data forms useful information for any highway project. It provides 
useful information for establishing past trends of growth. Project stretch of Jaipur to 
Deoli has recently been commissioned and tolling only commenced in 2013-14. Only 
3-4 years of traffic data is available with the project concessionaire. The following 
factors also have added to the inconsistency  in traffic volume on project during 
previous years. 
a) Demonetization in November 2016 
b) Ban on mining in Rajasthan 
c) Covid-19 Impact from Feb-20 onwards by successive waves

It is assumed that as the project is now completed after adding the balance length, the 
impact of demonetization is diminishing, and mining ban has also been lifted in area. 
This had impacted the traffic growth adversely.  
3.5 Other Factors Influencing Growth 
There are many factors which have an impact  on traffic growth. As discussed 
previously these factors can be economic, social, educational, and industrial.  
Potentiality of such factors for project highway is discussed as under.   
ECONOMY 
After witnessing a slowdown during 201 1-12, the economy recovered in 2013 -14, 
and a high growth rate of GDP was recorded up to 2018-19. Pandemic of COVID-19 
impacted all economies of world including India . Following figure show trend of 
GDP growth in India. 
 
Figure 3-4 : Growth of GDP in India 
FY 2017 -18 recorded a growth of 6.7% which had a slight  impact of GST and 
demonetization. Indian economy appears on recovery path with estimated growth of 
6.8% in FY 2018 -19. The government  took major policy decisions including tax 
infrastructure reforming, banking sector improvement and ease of doing business.  
Major economies of world collapsed due to pandemic COVID -19 including India. 
Indian economy is also register ed negative growth in financial year 2020 -21. After

that Indian economy recovered handsomely and registered a growth of about 9% in 
Year 2021-22.  
           Key economic activities 
 
The Asset is situated in the state of Rajasthan. Rajasthan is the largest state in India 
by area, sharing borders with five major states - Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, 
Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. It is rich in natural resources, particularly minerals, and 
produces about 57 different minerals. 1 Predominantly an agrarian economy and a 
major producer of grains, oilseeds and edible oil, the recent times has seen a high rise 
in the service sector growth wherein the sector contributed to 44% to state’s GSDP in 
2023-24 followed by agriculture at 29% and industries at 27%. The region is also a 
significant mineral rich state where in FY24 Rajasthan's revenue from mineral 
production was estimated at over ₹7,460 crore. The state produces 22 major and 36 
minor minerals and is the sole producer of key minerals like lead, zinc, wollastonite, 
selenite, calcite, and gypsum.  
3.6 Recommended Growth Rates of Traffic 
Based on the above analysis and after giving due consideration to the entire listed 
factors, the following overall growth rates are recommended for each category of 
vehicle as below. The rate of growth is moderate in light of overall regional trends. 
Growth of multi-Axle is kept slightly higher as trend of technological advances in 
logistic industry favors multi -axle over 2/3 axle carriage. It is also expected that as 
the economy moves from developing to developing, the rate of growth diminishes. 
The same growth rate is not sustainable for long.  
Temporary disruptions caused by implementation of Goods and Service Tax (GST) 
and demonetization have dissipated, and growth of economy has significantly 
improved since then. The curb  on mining activity in the area  due to the ban  on 
quarrying had affected traffic on this project.  
Growth rates are recommended for three scenarios for sensitivity analysis namely 
Optimistic, Pessimistic and Most Likely with a positive and negative variation 0.5% 
from Most Likely case.

Four - Laning of Jaipur - Deoli Section of NH-12 from Km 18.700 to Km 165.000 
4.2 Modification in Concession Period 
As per Article 29 of the concession agreement, if actual traffic on the project falls 
short or exceeds Target Traffic on project highway on defined date, concession 
period shall be modified subject to calculation stipulated therein. For Jaipur - Deoli 
project, the Target Date and Target Traffic are defined as below: 
Target Date - 1st October 2018 
Target Traffic - 30344 in PCU 
It was observed that as per traffic projections, traffic volume fell short of target traffic 
and concession period is expected to extend by about 5 years. 
Due to the suspension in toll in the year FY17 because of demonetization for a period 
of 24 days, the Concessionaire would be entitled to an extension of an additional 24 
days. 
Traffic was severely impacted on the project  highway during the covid lockdown 
period. NHAI has declared a policy of providing extension of concessions to make up 
for revenue loss during lockdown. It is expected that extensions will be provided to 
project the concession period on this account as well. 
Accordingly, traffic and revenue projections have been worked out up to the year  
2040-41.

OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE 
 
6.1 Operation & Maintenance 
The following  are project parameters which would contribute towards the cost  of 
operation and maintenance. 
The estimated cost of operation and maintenance has been provided by the 
Management. 
The following are the key components for operation and maintenance costs: 
1. Annual Regular Maintenance  – Covering pothole repair, shoulder and slope 
repair, drain cleaning, median maintenance, Crash barrier, toll plaza maintenance, 
Toll collection, other services like medical help and rescue operations etc.  
2. Periodic Maintenance – This will be done on a periodic basis, say every 5 years. 
It will consist of overlaying of wearing course and painting and marking. Some 
pavement strengthening is also anticipated in a few sections.  This operation and its 
cost are spread over three years.  
The year wise actual operation and maintenance cost is provided by management of 
asset and has been found reasonable. Same has been adopted in report for projection 
of operation and maintenance cost.

CHAPTER 7  
CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
7.1 Conclusion & Recommendations 
Project stretch of Jaipur to Deoli section of NH -12 in state of Rajasthan from km 
18.700 to km 165.000 is currently a four-lane road. The road is in sound condition 
and serves reasonably good levels of traffic volume. The project corridor falls in the 
influence zone of fast upcoming metro city Jaipur. There are many upcoming 
projects in the area which have the potential to boost economic growth of the area 
and add value to the development  of the region . All these developments have 
potential to give a positive impact to traffic flow on the project. As estimated in this 
study report, project traffic revenue is expected to grow at a rate of 6-8% per annum.   
 The following can be considered as major outcome of study. 
a) There is a good amount of tollable traffic running on the project. 
b) Project corridor has potential to witness traffic growth @ 6-8% annually in near 
future due to various development in area and overall growth of the economy. 
c) Project corridors do  not have risk of traffic leakage due to lack of competing 
roads of comparable quality. 
The project infrastructure is in good condition and its maintenance cost is also 
reasonable.  
Based on the above it can be considered a stable healthy project from the traffic and 
revenue point of view.

CHAPTER 1  
INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
The Government of India through National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) 
embarked upon a program to enhance the traffic capacity and safety for efficient 
transportation of goods as well as passenger traffic on National Hig hway Sections 
under NHDP Phase III. 
The project under consideration, Pathankot- Amritsar section of NH 15 from km 
6.082 to km 108.502 is one such road project NHAI intended to implement on a BOT 
basis in the DBFOT format. M/s IPATRL (Concessionaire) has been awarded the 
Project for a concession  period of 20 years starting from December 31, 2010 . The 
Project has been commissioned and is currently in the operation / maintenance phase. 
The Pathankot - Amritsar NH 15 Project comprises the section of NH 15 from km 
6.082 to km 108.502. IPATRL was entrusted to expand a 102.42 Km section of NH 
15 between Pathankot and Amritsar in Punjab from two lanes to four lanes on a 
DBFOT basis. The project received a completion certificate on November 27, 2014, 
and IPATRL commenced tolling fo r a project length of 102.42 Km  on th at date . 
Subsequently, the project received a final completion certificate on August 17, 2017.  
      Asset and regional context 
The Asset is 102.42 km long four lane section connecting Amritsar and 
Pathankot in the state of Punjab. The Asset was awarded on December 2010 
and received partial completion  certificated (PCOD) on 27th November 
2014 followed by Full COD on 17th August 2017. 
At a broader level, NH-54 is a 646 kilometer long National Highway in India 
and it runs from Pathankot in Punjab and ends in Bikaner district in Rajasthan, 
and the Asset is the part of this corridor itself. 
There are 2 toll plazas on the Asset and are located at:

• Toll Plaza (TP) 1 - Ladpalwan at KM 16+000 
• Toll Plaza (TP) 2 – Waryam nangal at KM 88+500 
Both Ladpalwan and Waryam Nangal toll plaza have 5x5 lane configuration. 
Both plazas have an additional lane in each direction for non tollable traffic. 
Electronic toll collection (ETC) is enabled at both the plazas. Weigh-in-motion 
(WIM) and static weighing is also available at both plazas to record overloaded 
trucks. 
The Asset has been impacted by episodes of farmers protests which took place 
at various parts of Punjab and Haryana between August 2020 and December 
2021. During this time, operations at all two toll plazas on the Asset were 
impacted, with no tolling during certain periods. This can be seen in the 
historical toll frequencies that have been summarized later in the report. 
Summarizing the trips on the Asset, Asset primarily caters to three 
different types of traffic movements: 
• Short-distance trips undertaken largely by passenger vehicles for 
work/business trips wherein the movement is predominantly local 
between the cities of Amritsar, Batala, Gurdaspur etc. 
• Medium-distance trips undertaken largely by the zones along the 
Asset, which are generated mainly between Amritsar/ South Punjab 
and states of JCK and Western Himachal Pradesh. 
• Long-distance trips mainly by 2A/3A and MAVs, catering to the 
long-distance movement with one trip-end in Gujarat/ Rajasthan 
 
1.2 Objective of the Study 
M/s IRB INVIT FUND has engaged GMD Consultants to assess the future traffic and 
toll potential of the project along with related operation & maintenance expenditure 
involved. 
This report named as “Toll Revenue and O&M Cost Projection Report” mainly 
focuses on traffic and O&M aspects of the project. Other parameters like c ompeting

road, area developments etc. have been considered from a traffic development point 
of view.  
1.2.1 Scope of Services 
The broad scope of work covered in the assignment is as follows. 
a) Analysis of Traffic Growth 
b) Toll Rate Growth 
c) Revenue Forecasting 
d) Operation and Maintenance Cost Projections 
The Concessionaire has provided basic traffic data and other project details on the 
basis of which the above analysis has been carried out.  
“Toll Revenue and O&M Cost Projection Report” was submitted in August 2017. In 
this report traffic data for the year  2016-17 was used as base traffic. The report was 
updated with traffic data of 2017 -18 and same was submitted in April 2018. The 
report was further updated with traffic Data of the period  from April 2018 to 
September 2019 and was submitted in October 2018. A revised report was submitted 
with updated traffic for the years  2018-19 in April 2019. The report  was further 
updated with yearly traffic data for 2019-20 in May 2020. Toll collection is affected 
on project stretch due to ongoing Farmer’s agitation in state. Toll collection is 
suspended at both toll plazas from early October 2020. T raffic data from April 2020 
to October 2020, April 2022 to March 2023, April-2023 to March -2024, April-2024 
to March -2025 was available, this report was updated taking this latest traffic data 
into consideration.  Hence the data from April-2025 to September-2025 can be 
considered as base traffic for future projections. Projections have been updated on the 
basis of this new data.

CHAPTER 2  
TRAFFIC SURVEYS AND ANALYSIS 
2.1 Traffic Survey 
In the course of our work, we have collected the required information for the project 
corridor to understand the general traffic and travel characteristics of the corridor.  
Toll operation on the project was suspended due to farmer’s agitation. Toll operation 
is resume d from December 2021 and only nine-month data is available for that 
period which is also affected due to Covid-19 Third wave. Classified traffic volume 
counts at the toll plaza locations on Pathankot -Amritsar section for base year 2022 -
23, 2023 -24,2024-25 and now Annual traffic data from April 20 25 to September 
2025. 
The following traffic data has been collected for the project.  
Classified traffic volume counts at the two toll plaza locations on Pathankot Amritsar 
section of NH-15for base year 2016 -17, 2017-18, 2018, 2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21, 
2021-22, 2022-23 2023-24,2024-25 and now Annual traffic data from April 202 5 to 
September 2025. 
• Local Component of traffic 
• Component of Return Journey 
• Component of Monthly Pass Journey 
The main objective of the traffic data analysis is to: 
• Determine the existing traffic movement characteristics of the project.  
• Establish base year traffic. 
• Identification of travel patterns and modal split of project traffic  
• Deriving growth factors for traffic forecasting 
• Estimation of corridor traffic including traffic diversion if any 
• Preparation of revenue model and projection of revenue as per toll policy for 
various scenarios

Count survey has been provided by concessionaire of project highway from actual 
traffic data gathered at toll plaza locations based on monthly data shared with NHAI. 
These locations are indicated in the figure and table given above. 
The vehicles can broadly be classified into fast moving / motorized and slow moving 
/ non-motorized vehicles, which can be further classified into specific categories of 
vehicles. The groupings of vehicles are further segregated to capture the toll able  
vehicle categories specifically and toll exempted vehicles are counted separately. The 
detailed vehicle classification system as per IRC: 64-1990 is given below.

However, since the project  highway is currently under toll operation, the data 
collected corresponds to the category  of toll able vehicles. The following  are the 
types of vehicles as per concession agreement.  
• Car / Jeep / van 
• Minibus /LCV

2.3 Traffic Characteristic 
Toll revenue of the project highway does not solely depend on traffic volume. There 
are certain characteristics of traffic which have significant potential to affect toll 
revenue. Components of local traffic, components of passenger and commercial 
traffic, portion of return journey traffic, portion of monthly pass traffic are some such 
characteristics of traffic. These will be discussed in subsequent sections of this report. 
2.3.1 Traffic Data 
Project concessionaire has provided Traffic data for base years 2018-19, 2019-20, April 2020 
to October-2020, 2022-23, 2023-24 2024- 25 & traffic data from April 2025 to September 
2025. 
Since the traffic data available for this update is for only Annual, from April 2025 to 
September 2025, it may not represent the whole year traffic. Hence a seasonality factor for 
balance part of year has been applied to average traffic of the current Six months to arrive at 
Annual Average Daily Traffic of base year 2025-26. Thus, corrected traffic is used for future 
projections and revenue calculations. The following table  shows historical traffic on project 
stretch and derived Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) for year 2025-26.

2.4 Data Analysis 
2.4.1 Analysis of Traffic Volume Count 
Understanding the character of existing traffic forms the basis of futuristic traffic 
forecast. The various vehicle types having different sizes and characteristics can be 
converted into a single unit called Passenger Car Unit (PCU). Passenger Car 
equivalents for various vehicles are adopted based on recommendations of Indian 
Road Congress prescribed in “IRC -64-1990: Guidelines for Capacity of Roads in 
Rural areas”. The adopted passenger car unit values (PCU) are presented in the table 
given below.

2.4.2 Components of Traffic 
As discussed previously, components of traffic volume play an important role in 
determining project revenue. A larger component of commercial traffic with higher 
axle configuration adds to project revenue positively. Similarly, a larger component 
of local traffic affects the project revenue potential negatively. 
It is observed that c ar traffic forms 67% of total traffic at to ll plaza location Km 
16.00 while multi axle vehicles are 19% of total traffic .7% of traffic is Truck /Bus 
while LCV traffic forms the balance 2%. Overall, about 33% of traffic is commercial 
in nature. 
At toll plaza location Km 88.50 car traf fic forms  77% of total traffic at toll plaza 
while multi axle and truck / bus are 12% and 4%. LCV volume is 2% of the total 
traffic. Overall, about 23% of traffic is commercial in nature  which is lower as 
compared to toll plaza location Km 16.00. 
Another important bifurcation of traffic is components of traffic with respect to 
various type of toll ticketing like 
1. Single Journey 
2. Return Journey 
3. Overweight Vehicles (Concessionaire provided special tariff for this category) 
4. Monthly Pass (Local and General)

2.5 Secondary data collection 
There are several other factors which have substantial impact on traffic patterns and 
growth on any project corridor. The following are some of such important factors. 
• Industrial development around project corridor and its catchment 
• Educational infrastructure along project corridor 
• Demographic pattern 
• Urban area development 
• Tourism potential 
• Upcoming major infrastructural or Industrial projects

CHAPTER 3  
GROWTH OF TRAFFIC ON PROJECT HIGHWAY 
3.1 Introduction 
Traffic growth is a function of the interplay of a number of contributory factors such 
as National economy, Government policy, socio -economic conditions of the people, 
and changes in land uses along the project corridor precincts etc. As these factors 
have a number of uncertainties associated with them, forecasts of traffic are 
dependent on the forecasts of factors such as population, gross domestic product 
(GDP), vehicle ownership, per capita income (PCI), agricultural output, fuel 
consumption etc. Future patterns of change in these factors can be estimated with 
only a reasonable degree of accuracy and hence the resultant traffic forecast levels 
may not be precise.  
Traffic growth forecast for project corridor Pathankot- Amritsar section of NH -15 
has been done taking the above factors into consideration. Established best practices 
and standard guidelines such as “ IRC: 108 -2015-Guidelines for Traffic Forecast 
on Highways” have been used for traffic growth forecast. 
3.2 Trend Analysis 
One of the methods of estimation of future rate of traffic growth is to assume the 
same rate of growth as experienced in the past. However, it may be noted that major 
influencing factors which reflect Economic conditions such as GDP, agricultural 
output, industrial output, national policies etc. are susceptible to change over a longer 
period of time and necessary adjustments need to be made to past trends to account 
for these changes.  
Thus, we have considered the Elasticity model of growth projection which is one of 
the most widely acceptable methods for traffic forecast and is recommended in IRC: 
108-2015-Guidelines for Traffic Forecast on Highways . Since the entire project 
alignment falls in Punjab State and has very little contribution from other states in 
terms of traffic , all developmental parameters pertaining to traffic  growth are 
considered for Punjab State only. 
In this method , past trends of any vehicular data are paired with an economic

Four - Laning of Pathankot - Amritsar Section of NH-15 from Km 6.082 to km 108.502 
indicator and a regression analysis is done to yield the economic model of growth. 
Growth of vehicle traffic varies for different types of vehicles. It is a proven fact that 
growth patterns for passenger and goods vehicles are different. Traffic growth on any 
highway typically depends on a number of economic parameters. The most 
important and direct parameters are given as under: 
• Per Capita Income  
• Net State Domestic Product (NSDP) 
• Population 
It is observed that the ownership of a car is more closely related to affordability 
hence per capita is the index which closely fits with growth of car traffic among 
other criteria. In similar fashion, the following pairs of vehicle type and independent 
variable can be established for elasticity modeling of growth. 
• Car / Jeep – Par Capita Income  
• Bus / Minibus – Population 
• Trucks / Heavy / Goods Vehicle – NSDP 
Time series data of vehicles (both passenger and goods) Registered in the state of 
Punjab is used as the base data for analysis of growth. 
3.3 Estimation of Traffic Demand Elasticity 
The elasticity of traffic demand is defined as the rate at which traffic intensity varies 
due to change in the corresponding indicator selected. Hence, in order to estimate the 
elasticity of traffic demand , it is necessary to establish the relationship between the 
growth in number of given categories of vehicle with one of the economic variables 
considered, such as NSDP, per capita income and population growth. 
As per IRC:  108-2015 the model for estimating elasticity index for the project 
corridor is of the following form and is as given below: 
Log (P) =  k x Log (EI) + A 
Where,   
P = Number of Vehicles (Mode wise) 
EI  = Economic Indicator

A = Regression constant  
k = Elasticity coefficient (Regression coefficient)  
The elasticity for cars and bus (passenger vehicles) is calculated based on the 
Population and Per Capita Domestic Product (PCDP) and the elasticity for trucks is 
calculated based on the Net State Domestic Product (NSDP).

Figure 3-3: Regression and Elasticity NSDP vs. Goods Traffic – extrapolation. 
Using the regression analysis above, we have arrived at the elasticity of traffic 
demand for each class of vehicle to a given change in relevant economic indicators. 
Average traffic growth of a vehicle class is multiplied by the corresponding elasticity 
coefficient to arrive at traffic growth.  
The results of these analyses for the good fit as reflected by R 2 values are presented 
in the Table below.

The economic  model for predicting growth is a good  tool, h owever other local, 
regional, and national  factors should also be considered before finalizing growth 
factors. Co nsidering factors such as Existing developments  and other influencing 
economic factors , moderated growth should be considered. These factors are 
discussed in subsequent sections. 
3.4 Analysis of Historic Traffic Data 
Historic t raffic data forms useful information for any highway project. It provides 
useful information for establishing past trends of growth. Project stretch of Pathankot 
to Amritsar has recently been commissioned and tolling commenced in 2014. Only a 
few years of traffic data are available, which is not sufficient to establish any credible 
trend. Moreover, due to the ban  on mining in the area  commercial traffic is 
temporarily affected. Lockdown for Corona Virus pandemic (COVID -19) disrupted 
project traffic in March 2020 . Traffic for the period from April 2020 to September 
2020 is impacted due to COVID -19 lockdown and from October -20 onwards toll 
collection was suspended on project which is recently resumed in December 2021 . 
Hence the same cannot be considered for historical growth. 
Hence traffic growth on the project  corridor has been taken from the economic  
model.   
3.5 Other Factors Influencing Growth 
There are many factors which have an impact  on traffic growth. As discussed 
previously these factors can be economic, social, educational, and industrial.  
Potentiality of such factors for project highway is discussed as under.   
ECONOMY 
After witnessing a slowdown during 201 1-12, the economy recovered in 2013 -14, 
and a high growth rate of GDP was recorded in up to 2018 -19. Pandemic of COVID-
19 impacted all economies of world including India . Following figure show trend of 
GDP growth in India.

Figure 3-4 : Growth of GDP in India 
FY 2017 -18 recorded a growth of 6.7% which had a slight  impact of GST and 
demonetization. Indian economy appears on recovery path with estimated growth of 
6.8% in FY 2018 -19.  The government  took major policy decisions including tax 
infrastructure reforming, banking sector improvement and ease of doing business.  
Major economies of world collapsed due to pandemic COVID -19 including India. 
Indian economy is also registered negative growth in financial year 2020 -21. After 
that Indian economy recovered handsomely and registered a growth of about 9% in 
Year 2021-22. This was partly due to low base of year 2020-21 as well. 
Honorable Prime Minister has announced a major relief package of Rs. 20 lakh 
crores which is about 10% of GDP. This is aimed at turning this major crisis of 
COVID-19 into an opportunity by providing major impetus to industrial production 
to the limit of becoming a self -reliant economy. With major thrust of this package 
being on Make -In- India it is expected that industry in India would grow at rapid 
pace and recover handsomely in post COVID -19 scenario. The World  Economic 
Outlook update also has predicted a growth rate of about 7.5 % in the next year 2022-

           Key economic activities 
The Asset passes through the key cities of Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Dinanagar, 
Batala and Pathankot in the state of Punjab. The Asset caters to short and long trips 
mainly generated along the Asset and states of JCK and Himachal Pradesh in the 
north and Rajasthan and Gujarat in the south. 
3.6 Recommended Growth Rates of Traffic 
Based on the above analysis and after giving due consideration to the entire listed 
factors, the following overall growth rates are recommended for each category of 
vehicle as below. Growth rates are recommended for three scenarios for sensitivity 
analysis namely Optimistic, Pessimistic and Most Likely with a positive and negative 
variation 0.5% and -1.0% from Most Likely case  respectively.  While working out 
future growth projections both historical and economic model growth are considered.  
The rate of growth is moderate in light of overall regional trends. Growth of multi-
Axle is kept slightly higher as the trend of technological advances in the logistics 
industry favors multi -axle over 2/3 axle carriage. It is also expected that as the 
economy moves from developing to developing, the rate of growth diminishes. Same 
growth rate is not sustainable for long. It is an established practice to step down  
future growth rates at intervals of 5 years.

The Delhi–Amritsar–Katra (DAK) Expressway is an ambitious infrastructure project aimed 
at enhancing connectivity between Delhi, Amritsar, and Katra. Spanning approximately 670 
kilometers, this is a four-lane access-controlled expressway. The expressway will traverse the 
states of Haryana, Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir.  
As understood from the Management, we understand the alignment of the DAK expressway 
is common with the Asset after Gurdaspur and diverts away from the Asset after crossing the 
Ladpalwan toll Plaza. We understand that the long -distance traffic destined from Delhi and 
eastern parts of the country travelling to Jammu, Katra or Pathankot will have a route choice 
to take the DAK Expressway or travel via the traditional NH -44 route. Hence, we believe it 
to be a positive impact to Ladpalwan toll plaza.  
We have considered the above impact in FY 30 & FY 31. 
Traffic and revenue have been worked out on the basis of the above growth, and some are 
presented in subsequent chapters of the report.

4.2 Modification in Concession Period 
As per Article 29 of the concession agreement, if actual traffic on the project falls 
short or exceeds Target Traffic on project highway on defined date, concession 
period shall be modified subject to calculation stipulated therein. For Pathankot - 
Amritsar project, the Target Date and Target Traffic are defined as below. 
Target Date - 1st January 2019 
Target Traffic - 34498 in PCU. 
It was observed that as per traffic projections, traffic volume falls short of target 
traffic in all scenarios. This warrants for extension of the concession  period. 
Extension of the concession  period is worked out as per the provisions  of concession 
agreement. The following  table provides details of modification in concession 
agreement.

Further, due to the suspension of toll in the year FY17 for a period of 24 days, the 
Concessionaire would be entitled to an extension of an additional 24 days. 
Traffic was severely impacted on the project highway during the COVID lockdown 
period. NHAI has declared a policy of providing extension of concession to make up 
for revenue loss during lockdown. It is expected extension would be provided to 
project concession period on this account as well. 
Concessionaire had initiated arbitration proceedings against National Highways 
Authority of India (“NHAI”) before the Hon’ble Arbitration Tribunal for extension 
of the Concession Period by 518 days and compensation for delay in completion of 
construction of the project on account of the reasons not attributable to 
Concessionaire. 
A petition filed by NHAI challenging the Arbitral Award has been dismissed by the 
Honorable Delhi High Court & the Arbitral Award has been upheld. As a result, the 
extension of the Concession period by 518 days would accrue to concession period. 
The matter is currently pending before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. 
Thus, a total of about 6 years would be added to the original  concession period. 
Projection of revenue and traffic has been done accordingly. 
Due to farmers’ protest in the state of Punjab and Haryana, toll operations were 
suspended from October 2020 to December 2021. As per the provisions  of the 
Concession agreement, the Concessionaire is eligible for extension of concession 
period by 441 days.   
Due to farmers’ protest in the state of Punjab, toll operations were temporarily 
suspended from December 16, 2022, to January 15, 2023. As per the provisions of 
the Concession agreement, the Concessionaire is eligible for extension of concession 
period by 31 days.

Factor of inflation / growth has been incorporated as per Schedule R. WPI are 
available up to 20 21-22. A moderate growth in Wholesale Price Index (WPI) has 
been assumed after that. Following graph provides projection of rate of inflation 
(WPI) in India. Data has been taken from Office of Economic Advisor web site 
(www.eaindustry.nic.in). WPI for years 2017-18 and 2018 -2019 is worked back by 
applying a correlation factor for 2004 -05 series as 2017 -18 and 2018 -2019 data is 
available in 2011 -12 series only. Ratio of WPI for year 2016 -17 for both series is 
used for conversion of WPI in 2004-05 series. 
 
Figure 5-1 : Historical Rate of WPI Inflation in India 
Except for the negative growth of WPI in the year 2015 -16 average inflation in WPI 
from the year 2005 -2025 is 4.86%. For Future year initially it takes 5% up to FY 
2028 and thereafter suitably stepped down 4.5 % for future year.

There are a number of bypasses and structures in each package. Equivalent length for 
structures is added to tollable length at each toll plaza. Bypasses cost more than Rs. 
50 Cr. are to be charged as per fee notification which provides incremental rate over 
basic rate for Rs. 15 Cr cost of bypass. The following  table provides details of  
Bypasses having cost more than Rs. 50 Cr. 
Additional rates for bypass having cost more than Rs. 50 Cr has been added as per 
schedule -R in t oll rates for both toll plazas. Lengths of bypasses are  deducted to 
arrive at effective length of road for each toll plaza for normal toll rates. Effective 
length excluding length of bypasses thus works out to Km 31.310 and Km 36.97 for 
Toll Plaza at Km 16.00 and Km 88.50 respectively. 
Toll rates are calculated as per guidelines provided in schedule R (rounded to nearest 
Rs. five) for the concession period and  are given below. Since applicable length of 
highway length is equal for both plazas, applicable toll rates are also same 
Thus, worked out rates for various categories of vehicle and discounts are given as 
under.

CHAPTER 6  
OPERATION &MAINTENANCE COST 
6.1 General 
The following are project parameters which would contribute towards the cost of 
operation and maintenance. 
The estimated cost of operation and maintenance has been provided by the 
Management. 
The following are the key components for operation and maintenance costs: 
1. Annual Regular Maintenance  – Covering pothole repair, shoulder and slope 
repair, drain cleaning, median maintenance, Crash barrier, toll plaza maintenance, 
Toll collection, other services like medical help and rescue operations etc.  
2. Periodic Maintenance – This will be done on a periodic basis, say every 5 years. 
It will consist of overlaying of wearing course and painting and marking. Some 
pavement strengthening is also anticipated in a few sections.  This operation and its 
cost are spread over three years.  
The year wise actual operation and maintenance cost is provided by management of 
asset and has been found reasonable. Same has been adopted in report for projection 
of operation and maintenance cost.

CHAPTER 7  
CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
7.1 Conclusion & Recommendations 
Project stretch of Pathankot to Amritsar section of NH -15 in state of Punjab from km 
6.082 to km 108.502 is currently a four-lane road. The road is in sound condition and 
serves reasonably good levels of traffic volume. The project corridor falls in the 
influence zone of fast upcoming metro city Amritsar. There are many upcoming 
projects in the area which have the potential to boost economic growth of the area 
and add value to the development  of the region . All these developments have 
potential to give a positive impact to traffic flow on the project. As estimated in this 
study report, project traffic is expected to grow at rate of 6 -8% per annum  in post 
COVID-19 scenario.   
 The following can be considered as major outcome of study. 
a) There is a good amount of toll able traffic running on the project. 
b) Project corridor has potential to witness good traffic growth annually in near 
future due to various development in area and overall growth of the econom y 
once tolling is resumed on project stretch. 
c) Project corridor does not have risk of traffic leakage due to lack of competing 
roads of comparable quality.  
d) Project infrastructure is in good condition and its maintenance cost is also 
reasonable. 
Based on the above it can be considered a stable healthy project from the traffic and 
revenue point of view.

CHAPTER 1  
INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
The Government of India through National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) 
embarked upon a program to enhance the traffic capacity and safety for efficient 
transportation of goods as well as passenger traffic on National Highway Sections 
under NHDP Phase V . Under Phase V NHAI has planned to convert 6,500 km of 
existing 4-lane National Highways into 6-lane National Highway. Sections envisaged 
under 6-laning comprise the Golden Quadrilateral section (5,700 km) and some other 
sections which are 800 km in length. 
The project under consideration, Talegaon - Amravati section of NH -6 from Km 
100.000 to km 166.725 is one such road project NHAI intended to implement on a 
BOT basis in the DBFOT format. M/s IRB Talegaon - Amravati Tollway Ltd . 
(Concessionaire) has been awarded the Project for concession period of 22 years 
starting from 3 rd September 2010 to 2 nd September 2032. The Project has been 
commissioned and is currently in the operation / maintenance phase. 
     Asset and regional context 
The Asset is 66.725 km, 4 -lane toll road located in Maharashtra and is part of 
NH-53, as shown in the below figure. It runs from Talegaon to Amravati and 
is part of the East-West national connection between Kolkata and Mumbai via 
Nagpur, making it a very strategic route, as it is one of the few major east-west 
highways and spans across the widest central part of the country. It is part of 
NH-53/NH-6 corridor which connects Hazira and Kolkata via Surat, Dhule, 
Amravati, Nagpur, Raipur, and Sambalpur. There is one toll plaza on the Asset 
which is closer to Talegaon - Nandgaon Peth. 
 
The section between Amravati and Nagpur has been in good, 4-lane condition for 
a long time, making it a seamless connection between various origins and 
destinations along this route. 
Currently, the traffic patterns include high proportion of passenger traffic

commuting either locally, or between Nagpur, Kondhali, Talegaon, Tiwsa, Mojhari, 
Amravati, Karanja etc. Commercial traffic also has these centres as significant 
contributors and in addition, there are trips observed between centres such as 
Dhule, Nashik, Jalna, Pune, Mumbai on western end and Bhilai, Sambalpur 
Kolkata, on the eastern end. However, the proportion of long-distance has reduced 
recently due to network developments. 
 
There are trips observed between western regions of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh 
via Morshi, crossing the toll plaza. Therefore, a share of traffic remains unique to this 
Asset beyond the East-West movement too. 
1.2 Objective of the Study 
M/s IRB INVIT FUND has engaged GMD Consultants to assess the future traffic and 
toll potential of the project along with related operation & maintenance expenditure 
involved. 
This report named as “Toll Revenue and O&M Cost Projection  Report” mainly 
focuses on traffic and O&M aspects of the project. Other parameters like competing 
road, area developments etc. have been considered from a traffic development point of 
view. 
1.2.1 Scope of Services 
The broad scope of work covered in the assignment is as follows. 
a) Analysis of Traffic Growth 
b) Toll Rate Growth 
c) Revenue Forecasting 
d) Operation and Maintenance Cost Projections 
The Concessionaire has provided basic historical traffic data and other project details 
on the basis of which the above analysis has been carried out , after applying our 
judgment on the traffic estimates. 
“Toll Revenue and O&M Cost Projection Report” was submitted in March 2017. In 
this report traffic data of year 2015-16 was used as base traffic. The report was updated 
with traffic data for the year 2016-17 and report was submitted in October 2017. The 
report was further updated with traffic data of 2017 -18 and same was submitted in 
April 2018. The report was further updated with traffic Data of the period from April 
2018 to September 201 8 and was submitted in October 2018. A revised report was

TRAFFIC SURVEYS AND ANALYSIS 
 
2.1 Traffic Surveys 
In the course of our work, we have collected the required information for the project 
corridor to understand the general traffic and travel characteristics of the corridor.  
The following traffic data has been collected for the project. 
• Classified traffic volume counts at toll plaza locations on Amravati - Talegaon 
section of NH-6 for base year 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20, 
2020-21, 2021-22 ,2022-23,2023-24,2024-25 and annual traffic data from 
April 2025 to September 2025.

2.2 Classified Traffic Volume Count 
The objective of conducting a Classified Traffic Volume Count is to understand the 
traffic flow pattern including modal split on a roadway. The Classified Traffic Volume 
Count survey has been provided by concessionaire of project highway from actual 
traffic data gathered at toll plaza locations  based on monthly data shared with NHAI . 
These locations are indicated in Figure 2-1 and listed in Table 2-1. 
The vehicles can broadly be classified into fast moving / motorized and slow moving 
/ non-motorized vehicles, which can be further classified into specific categories of 
vehicles. The groupings of vehicles are further segregated to capture the tollable 
vehicle categories specifically and toll exempted vehicles are counted separately. The 
detailed vehicle classification system as per IRC: 64-1990 is given in

collected corresponds to category of tollable vehicles. The following are the types of 
vehicles as per concession agreement.  
• Car / Jeep / van 
• Minibus /LCV 
• Truck / Bus 
• Multi Axle

revenue. Components of local traffic, components of passenger and commercial traffic, 
portion of return journey traffic, portion of monthly pass traffic are some such 
characteristics of traffic. These will be discussed in subsequent sections of this report. 
2.3.1 Traffic Data 
The Concessionaire has provided Traffic data for base year 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-
19, 2019-20, 2020-21,2021-22, 2022-23, 2023-24,2024-25 & traffic data from April 2025 to 
September 2025. 
Since the traffic data available for this update is for only Annual, from April 2025 to September 
2025, it may not represent the whole year traffic. Hence a seasonality factor for balance part 
of year has been applied to average traffic of the current Six months to arrive at Annual 
Average Daily Traffic of base year 2025 -26. Thus, corrected traffic is used for  future 
projections and revenue calculations. The following table  shows historical traffic on project 
stretch and derived Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) for year 2025-26.

It can be observed from above that project traffic has PCU index close to 2.0 which 
indicates balance mix of commercial, goods traffic and passenger traffic. It can be 
appreciated that the character of traffic is consistent on stretch. 
2.4.2 Components of Traffic 
As discussed previously, components  of traffic volume play an important role in 
determining project revenue. A larger component of commercial traffic with higher axle 
configuration adds to project revenue positively. Similarly, a larger component of local 
traffic affects the project revenue potential negatively.  
For the purpose of analysis, the recent traffic numbers for the period  April 2025 to 
September 2025 have been considered as the base numbers. 
It is observed that car traffic forms 66% of total traffic at toll plaza location 142.800 where 
multi axle commercial vehicles comprise 16% of total traffic. Overall, about 34% of traffic 
is commercial in nature. 
Another important bifurcation of traffic is components of traffic with respect to various 
type of toll ticketing like 
1. Single Journey 
2. Return Journey 
3. Monthly Pass (Local and General)

A significant part of the traffic at KM 142.800 is single journey 41% followed by return 
journey 53%, monthly passes which share 1% and Annual Pass car is 5% of the total 
traffic volume. 
2.5 Secondary Data Collection 
There are several other factors which have a substantial impact on traffic patterns and 
growth on any project corridor. The following are some of such important factors. 
• Industrial development around project corridor and its catchment 
• Educational infrastructure along project corridor 
• Demographic pattern 
• Urban area development 
• Tourism potential 
• Upcoming major infrastructural or Industrial projects 
• Special Industry in project corridor  
• Overall trends of economic growth local as well as national / regional 
Hence in addition to traffic details on the project site, secondary data was also collected 
from the various sources. Typical secondary data includes the following:

CHAPTER 3  
GROWTH OF TRAFFIC ON PROJECT HIGHWAY 
 
3.1 Introduction 
Traffic growth is a function of the interplay of a number of contributory factors such 
as National economy, Government policy, socio -economic conditions of the people, 
and changes in land uses along the project corridor precincts etc. As these factors have 
a number of uncertainties associated with them, forecasts of traffic are dependent on 
the projections of other factors such as population, gross domestic product (GDP), 
vehicle ownership, per capita income (PCI), agricultural output, fuel consumption etc. 
Future patterns of change in these factors can be estimated with only a reasonable 
degree of accuracy and hence the resultant traffic forecast levels may not be precise. 
Traffic growth forecast for project corridor Bharuch - Surat section of NH-8 has been 
done taking the above  factors into consideration. “ IRC: 108 -2015-Guidelines for 
Traffic Prediction on Rural Highways” is established best practice and has been used 
for traffic growth forecast. 
3.2 Trend Analysis 
One of the methods of estimation of future rate of traffic growth is to assume the same 
rate of growth as experienced in the past. However, it may be noted that major 
influencing factors which reflect Economic conditions such as GDP, agricultural 
output, industrial output, national policies etc. are susceptible to change over a longer 
period of time and necessary adjustments need to be made to past trends to account for 
these changes.  
Thus, we have considered the Elasticity model of growth projection which is one of 
the most widely acceptable methods for traffic forecast and is recommended in IRC: 
108-2015-Guidelines for Traffic Prediction on Rural Highways. 
In this method past trends of any vehicular data are paired with an economic indicator 
and a regression analysis is done to yield the economic model of growth. Growth of 
vehicle traffic varies for different types of vehicle. It is a proven fact that growth 
patterns for passenger and goods vehicles are different. Traffic growth on any highway 
typically depends on a number of economic parameters. The most important and direct 
parameters are given as below 
• Per Capita Income  
GMD Consultants IRB INVIT FUND

UPDATE ON TOLL REVENUE AND O&M COST PROJECTION REPORT 
 
Four - Laning of Talegaon - Amravati Section of NH-6from Km 100.000 to Km 166.725 
• Net State Domestic Product (NSDP) 
• Population 
It is observed that the ownership of a car is more closely related to affordability hence 
per capita is the index which closely fits with growth of car traffic among other criteria. 
In similar fashion, the following pairs of vehicle type and independent variable can be 
established for elasticity modeling of growth. 
• Car / Jeep – Par Capita Income  
• Bus / Minibus – Population 
• Trucks / Heavy / Goods Vehicle – NSDP 
Time series data of vehicles (both passenger and goods) Registered in state of 
Maharashtra is used as the base data for analysis of growth. 
3.3 Estimation of Traffic Demand Elasticity 
The elasticity of traffic demand is defined as the rate at which traffic intensity varies 
due to change in the corresponding indicator selected. Hence, in order to estimate the 
elasticity of traffic demand, it is necessary to establish the relationship between the 
growth in number of given categories of vehicle with one of the economic variables 
considered, such as NSDP, per capita income and population growth. Latest available 
data for vehicle registration, per capita income, NSDP and population is used in 
analysis. 
As per IRC: 108-2015 the model for estimating elasticity index for the project corridor 
is of the following form and is as given below: 
Log (P)= k x Log (EI) + A 
Where,   
P =Number of Vehicles (Mode wise) 
EI  = Economic Indicator 
A = Regression constant  
k = Elasticity coefficient (Regression coefficient)  
The elasticity for cars and bus (passenger vehicles) is calculated based on the 
Population and Per Capita Domestic Product (PCDP) and the elasticity for trucks is 
calculated based on the Net State Domestic Product (NSDP).  
The following tables and graphs depict regression and elasticity of growth model.

Using the regression analysis above, we have arrived at the elasticity of traffic demand 
for each class of vehicle to a given change in relevant economic indicators. Average 
traffic growth of a vehicle class is multiplied by the corresponding elasticity coefficient 
to arrive at traffic growth. R 2 is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the 
fitted regression line. It varies from 0 to 1. The higher  the value of R 2 more 
representative is the regression model of data.  
The results of these analyses for the good fit as reflected by R2 values are presented in 
the Table below.

While the economic model for predicting growth is a good tool, other local, regional, 
national factors such as proposed developments etc. should also be considered before 
finalizing growth factors. These factors are discussed in subsequent sections.

3.4 Analysis of Historic Traffic Data 
Historic traffic data forms useful information for any highway project. It provides 
useful information for establishing past trends of growth. Project stretch of Talegaon 
to Amravati has recently been commissioned and tolling commenced in 2013. Stable 
traffic data from the year 2015-16 is only available for stretching, which is not enough 
to establish any growth pattern for future. The following  table presents details of 
historic traffic on project road. 
3.5 Other Factors Influencing Growth 
There are many factors which have an impact  on traffic growth. As discussed 
previously these factors can be economic, social, educational, and industrial.  
Potentiality of such factors for project highway is discussed as under.   
ECONOMY 
After witnessing a slowdown during 2011-12, the economy recovered in 2013-14, and 
a high growth rate of GDP was recorded up to 2018 -19. Pandemic of COVID -19 
impacted all economies of world including India. Following figure show trend of GDP 
growth in India.

6.8% in FY 2018 -19.  The government  took major policy decisions including tax 
infrastructure reforming, banking sector improvement and ease of doing business.  
Major economies of world collapsed due to pandemic COVID -19 including India. 
Indian economy is also registered negative growth in financial year 2020-21. After that 
Indian economy recovered handsomely and registered a growth of about 9% in Year 
2021-22. This was partly due to the low base for the year 2020-21 as well. 
           Key economic activities 
Amravati is one of the fastest growing cities of Maharashtra which has the 
foundation for manufacturing and handicraft industries as well as religious 
tourism because of the famous Ambadevi temple. The city is known for its 
production of jewellery, carpets and metal ware products. Therefore, there is also 
movement between steel clusters in Chhattisgarh and Amravati observed on the 
Asset. 
3.6 Recommended Growth Rates of Traffic 
Based on the above analysis and after giving due consideration to the entire listed 
factors, the following overall growth rates are recommended for each category of 
vehicle as below. The rate of growth is moderate in light of overall regional trends. 
Growth of multi-Axle is kept slightly higher as trend of technological advances in 
logistic industry favors multi-axle over 2/3 axle carriage. It is also expected that as the 
economy moves from developing to developing, the rate of growth diminishes. The 
same growth rate is not sustainable for long. It is an established practice to step down 
future growth rates at suitable interval of years.  
Temporary disruptions caused by implementation of Goods and Service Tax (GST) 
and demonetization have dissipated, and growth of economy has significantly 
improved since then. Hence the corridor can expect to have expected growth. 
Growth rates are recommended for three scenarios for sensitivity analysis namely 
Optimistic, Pessimistic and Most Likely with a positive and negative variation 0.5% 
from Most Likely case.

4.2 Modification in Concession Period 
As per Article 29 of the concession agreement, if actual traffic on the project falls short 
or exceeds Target Traffic on project highway on defined date, concession period shall 
be modified subject to calculation stipulated therein. For Talegaon - Amravati project, 
the Target Date and Target Traffic are defined as under: 
Target Date - 1st April 2020 
Target Traffic - 41052 in PCU 
It was observed that as per traffic projections, traffic volume falls short of target traffic 
in all scenarios. This warrants an extension of the envisaged concession period. Based 
on the above traffic estimate probable extension of concession period is worked out as 
per article 29 of concession agreement which is summarized as under – 
Scenario 
Projected Traffic in PCUs 
(average of traffic on target 
date, one year before target 
date and one year after target 
date) 
Expected extension in 
Concession Period 
All 24187 4.4 years 
Due to the suspension in toll in the year FY17 because of demonetization for a period 
of 24 days, the Concessionaire would be entitled to an extension of an additional 24 
days. Traffic was severely impacted on the project highway during the covid lockdown

period. NHAI has declared a policy of providing extension of concessions to make up 
for revenue loss during lockdown. It is expected that a n extension would be provided 
to the project concession period on this account also. 
Hence, traffic and toll revenue projections have been worked out for additional 5 years 
beyond original concession period.

CHAPTER 5  
FORECAST OF TOLL REVENUE 
 
5.1 General 
This chapter presents the tolling rate calculations , categories and toll revenue of the 
project. 
5.2 Discount Categories 
As per the Toll Notification (Schedule R) the following discounts have been 
considered: 
1. Monthly Pass: For frequent users, monthly pass is issued for 50 trips per month. 
The discount factor works out to 33.33% for 50 journeys. 
2. Daily Pass (for Return Trip): A 75% discount will be offered on the return trip. 
3. Single Journey: Full single journey toll would be charged to this category of 
vehicles who are infrequent travelers or whose frequency does not yield any 
discount from the above categories. 
4. Local Car / Jeep / Van to be charged at Rs 150 per month (2007) 
5. Additionally, Concessionaire has introduced monthly rates for local 
commercial vehicles also. 
Building of inflation and escalation of rate on the basis of WPI are done as per toll 
notification (Schedule R) as given under 
 
Factor of inflation / growth has been incorporated as per Schedule R. WPI are available 
up to 2021-22. A moderate growth in Wholesale Price Index (WPI) has been assumed 
after that. Following graph provides projection of rate of inflation (WPI) in India. Data 
has been taken from Office of Economic Advisor web site (www.eaindustry.nic.in). 
WPI for years 2017-18 and 2018-2019 is worked back by applying a correlation factor

for 2004-05 series as 2017-18 and 2018-2019 data is available in 2011-12 series only. 
Ratio of WPI for year 2016-17 for both series is used for conversion of WPI in 2004 -
05 series. 
 
Figure 5-1 : Historical Rate of WPI Inflation in India 
Except for the negative growth of WPI in the year 2015-16 average inflation in WPI from 
the year 2005 -2025 is 4.86%. For Future year initially it takes 5% up to FY 2028 and 
thereafter suitably stepped down 4.5 % for future year. 
5.3 Estimation of Toll Rates 
As per the applicable MORTH notification and Schedule R of contract agreement, the 
following Base rate of fee for the categories mentioned in the table stands true in the 
National Highways Fee Rules, 2008.

OPERATION & MAINTENANCE 
6.1 Operation & Maintenance 
The following are project parameters which would contribute towards the cost of operation 
and maintenance. 
The estimated cost of operation and maintenance has been provided by the Management. 
The following are the key components for operation and maintenance costs: 
1. Annual Regular Maintenance  – Covering pothole repair, shoulder and slope repair, 
drain cleaning, median maintenance, Crash barrier, toll plaza maintenance, Toll collection, 
other services like medical help and rescue operations etc.  
2. Periodic Maintenance – This will be done on a periodic basis, say every 5 years. It will 
consist of overlaying of wearing course and painting and marking. Some pavement 
strengthening is also anticipated in a few sections.  This operation and its cost are spread 
over three years.  
The year wise actual operation and maintenance cost is provided by management of asset 
and has been found reasonable. Same has been adopted in report for projection of operation 
and maintenance cost.

CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
7.1 Conclusion & Recommendations 
Project stretch of Talegaon to Amravati section of NH-6 in state of Maharashtra from 
km 100.000 to km 166.725 is currently a four-lane road. The road is in sound condition 
and serves to stable traffic volumes. Project corridor is part of major east west 
connectivity National highway NH-6. There are many upcoming projects in the area 
which will boost economic growth of the area and add value to the development of the 
region. All these developments have potential to give a positive impact to traffic flow 
on the project. The following can be considered as major outcome of study. 
a) There is a good amount of tollable traffic running on the project. 
b) Project corridor has potential to witness traffic growth @ 6 -8% annually post 
COVID-19 impact in the near future, further moderated by 1-2% in the longer term 
due to various development in area and overall development of economy. 
The project infrastructure is in good condition and its maintenance cost is also 
reasonable.  
Based on the above it can be considered a stable healthy project from the traffic and 
revenue point of view.

CHAPTER 1  
INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
The Government of India through National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) 
embarked upon a program to enhance the traffic capacity and safety for efficient 
transportation of goods as well as passenger traffic on National Highway Sections 
under NHDP Phase V. Under Phase V NHAI has planned to convert 6,500 km of 
existing 4-lane National Highways into 6-lane National Highway. Sections envisaged 
under 6-laning comprise the Golden Quadrilateral section (5,700 km) and some other 
sections which are 800 km in length. 
The project under consideration, Tumkur - Chitradurga Section of NH -4 is one such 
road project NHAI intended to implement on a BOT basis in the DBFOT format. M/s 
IRB Tumkur  Chitradurga Tollway Ltd . (Concessionaire) has been awarded the 
Project for concession period of 26 years starting from June 4 th, 2011, to June 3 rd, 
2037. The Project has been commissioned and is currently in the operation / 
maintenance phase.  
           Asset and regional context 
The Tumkur -Chitradurga Asset is a 114 Kms 6 -lane road, part of NH -48 connecting   
Delhi to Chennai (Tamil Nadu) which is one of the oldest trunk routes in India. The 
Asset has two toll plazas including Guilalu and Karjeevanhalli. 
The Asset is part of the NH 48 that connects Delhi to Chennai and lies on the 
strategic Delhi – Mumbai – Bengaluru - Chennai corridor. 
1.2 Objective of the Study 
M/s IRB INVIT FUND has engaged GMD Consultants to assess the future traffic and 
toll potential of the project along with related operation & maintenance expenditure 
involved. 
This report named as “Toll Revenue and O&M Cost Projection  Report” mainly 
focuses on traffic and O&M aspects of the project. Other parameters like competing 
road, area developments etc. have been considered from a traffic development point 
of view.  
1.2.1 Scope of Services 
The broad scope of work covered in the assignment is as follows.

CHAPTER 2  
TRAFFIC SURVEYS AND ANALYSIS 
 
2.1 Traffic Surveys 
In the course of our work, we have collected the required  information for  project 
corridor to understand the general traffic and travel characteristics of the corridor.  
The following traffic data has been collected for the project. 
• Classified traffic volume counts at the two toll plaza locations on Tumkur-
Chitradurga section of NH-4 for base year 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-
19, 2019-20, 2020-21, 2021-22,2022-23, 2023-24,2024-25 and annual traffic 
data from April 2025 to September 2025. 
• Local Component of traffic 
• Component of Return Journey 
• Component of Monthly Pass Journey 
 
The main objective of the traffic data analysis is to: 
• Determine the existing traffic movement characteristics of project.  
• Establish base year traffic. 
• Identification of travel patterns and modal split of project traffic 
• Deriving growth factors for traffic forecasting 
• Estimation of corridor traffic including traffic diversion if any 
• Preparation of revenue model and projection of revenue as per toll policy for 
various scenarios 
The p roject can be divided into two homogenous sections from a traffic  point of 
view.  
These sections can be.  
1. Chitradurga to Sira 
2. Sira to Tumkur 
Traffic of both sections is represented by toll plaza in each section.

2.2 Classified Traffic Volume Count 
The objective of conducting a Classified Traffic Volume Count is to understand the 
traffic flow pattern including modal split on a roadway. The Classified Traffic Volume 
Count survey has been provided by concessionaire of project highway from actual 
traffic data gathered at toll plaza locations  based on monthly data shared with NHAI . 
These locations were indicated in Figure 2-1 and listed in Table 2-1.

The vehicles can broadly be classified into fast moving / motorized and slow moving 
/ non-motorized vehicles, which can be further classified into specific categories of 
vehicles. The groupings of vehicles are further segregated to capture the tollable 
vehicle categories specifically and toll exempted vehicles are counted separately. The 
detailed vehicle classification system as per IRC: 64-1990 is given in Table 2-2.

However, since the project highway is currently under toll operation, the data 
collected corresponds to the category of tollable vehicles. The following are the types 
of vehicles as per the Concession Agreement.  
• Car / Jeep / Van 
• LCV 
• Truck / Bus 
• HCM/ EME/ MAV 
2.3 Traffic Characteristic 
Toll revenue of the project highway does not solely depend on traffic volume. There 
are certain characteristics of traffic which have significant potential to affect toll 
revenue. Components of local traffic, components of passenger and commercial 
traffic, portion of return journey traffic, portion of monthly pass traffic are some such 
characteristics of traffic. These will be discussed in subsequent sections of this 
report.

2.3.1 Traffic Data 
The C oncessionaire has provided Traffic data for base year 2015 -16, 2016-17, 2017 -18, 
2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21, 2021-22, 2022-23, 2023-2024-25 & traffic data from April 2025 
to September 2025. 
Since the traffic data available for this update is for only Annual, from April 2025 to 
September 2025, it may not represent the whole year traffic. Hence a seasonality factor for 
balance part of year has been applied to average traffic of the current Six months to arrive at 
Annual Average Daily Traffic of base year 2025-26. Thus, corrected traffic is used for future 
projections and revenue calculations. The following table  shows historical traffic on project 
stretch and derived Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) for year 2025-26.

2.4 Data Analysis 
2.4.1 Analysis of Traffic Volume Count 
Understanding the character of existing traffic forms the basis of traffic forecast . The 
various vehicle types having different sizes and characteristics can be converted into 
a single unit called Passenger Car Unit (PCU). Passenger Car equivalents for various 
vehicles are adopted based on recommendations of Indian Road Congress prescribed 
in “IRC -64-1990: Guidelines for Capacity of Roads in Rural areas”. The adopted 
passenger car unit values (PCU) are presented in Table 2-5.

It can be observed from the above that project traffic has a PCU index near 2.5 which 
indicates a good mix of commercial and passenger traffic. 
2.4.2 Components of Traffic 
As discussed previously, components of traffic volume play an important role in 
determining project revenue. A Larger component of commercial traffic with higher 
axle configuration adds to project revenue positively. Similarly, a larger component 
of local traffic affects the project revenue potential negatively.

For the purpose of analysis, the recent traffic numbers for the period April 2024 to 
September 2024 have been considered as the base numbers. 
It is observed that at Toll KM 172.770 Car traffic forms 56% of total traffic while 
HCM / EME / MAV comprises 19% of total traffic. Overall, about 44% of traffic is 
commercial in nature, and at Toll KM 104.530 Car traffic forms 51% of total traffic 
while HCM / EME / MAV comprises 2 2% of total traffic. Overall, about 49% of 
traffic is commercial in nature. 
Another important bifurcation of traffic is components of traffic with respect to 
various types of toll ticketing.

2.5 Secondary Data Collection 
There are several other factors which have a substantial impact on traffic patterns and 
growth on any project corridor. The following are some of such important factors. 
• Industrial development around project corridor and its catchment 
• Educational infrastructure along project corridor 
• Demographic pattern 
• Urban area development 
• Tourism potential 
• Upcoming major infrastructural or Industrial projects 
• Special Industry in project corridor 
• Overall trends of economic growth local as well as national / regional 
Hence in addition to traffic details on the project  site, secondary data was also 
collected from the various sources. Typical secondary data includes the following: 
1. Vehicle registration data of regional and national level. 
2. Economic Data

CHAPTER 3  
GROWTH OF TRAFFIC ON PROJECT HIGHWAY 
3.1 Introduction 
Traffic growth is a function of the interplay of a number of  contributory factors such 
as National economy, Government policy, socio -economic conditions of the people, 
and changes in land uses along the project corridor precincts etc. As these factors 
have a number of uncertainties associated with them, forecasts of traffic are 
dependent on the forecasts of factors such as population, gross domestic product 
(GDP), vehicle ownership, per capita income (PCI), agricultural output, fuel 
consumption etc. Future patterns of change in these factors can be estimated with 
only a reasonable degree of accuracy and hence the resultant traffic forecast levels 
may not be precise. 
Traffic growth forecast for project corridor viz. Tumkur – Chitradurga section of NH-
4 has been done after taking the above factors into consideration. “IRC: 108-2015-
Guidelines for Traffic Prediction on Rural Highways ” is established best practice 
and has been used for traffic growth forecast. 
3.2 Trend Analysis 
One of the methods of estimation of future rate of traffic growth is to assume the 
same rate of growth as experienced in the past. However, it may be noted that major 
influencing factors which reflect Economic conditions such as GDP, agricultural 
output, industrial output, national policies etc. are susceptible to change over a longer 
period of time and necessary adjustments need to be made to past trends to account 
for these changes.  
Elasticity model of growth projection is one of the most widely acceptable methods 
for traffic forecast. The same is recommended in IRC: 108 -2015-Guidelines for 
Traffic Prediction on Rural Highways. 
In this method past trends of any vehicular data are paired with an economic 
indicator and a regression analysis is done to yield the economic model of growth. 
Growth of vehicle traffic varies for different types of vehicles. It is a proven fact that 
growth patterns for passenger and goods vehicles are different. Traffic growth on any 
highway typically depends on a number of economic parameters. The most important 
and direct parameters are given as under 
• Per Capita Income

UPDATE ON TOLL REVENUE AND O&M COST PROJECTION REPORT 
 
Six - Laning of Tumkur - Chitradurga Section of NH-4from Km 75.000 to Km 189.000 
• Net State Domestic Product (NSDP) 
• Population 
It is observed that the ownership of a car is more closely related to affordability 
hence per capita is the index which closely fits with growth of car traffic among 
other criteria. In similar fashion, the following pairs of vehicle type and independent 
variable can be established for elasticity modeling of growth. 
• Car / Jeep – Par Capita Income  
• Bus / Minibus – Population 
• Trucks / Heavy / Goods Vehicle – NSDP 
Time series data of vehicles (both passenger and goods) Registered in state of 
Karnataka is used as the base data for analysis of growth. 
3.3 Estimation of Traffic Demand Elasticity 
The elasticity of traffic demand is defined as the rate at which traffic intensity varies 
due to change in the corresponding indicator selected. Hence, in order to estimate the 
elasticity of traffic demand, it is necessary to establish the relationship between the 
growth in number of given categories of vehicle with one of the economic variables 
considered, such as NSDP, per capita income and population growth. Latest available 
data for vehicle registration, per capita income, NSDP and population is used in 
analysis. 
As per IRC: 108 -2015 the model for estimating elasticity index for the project 
corridor is of the following form and is as given below: 
Log (P) = k x Log (EI) + A 
Where,   
P = Number of Vehicles (Mode wise) 
EI  =  Economic Indicator 
A =  Regression constant  
k =  Elasticity coefficient (Regression coefficient)  
The elasticity for cars and buses (passenger vehicles) is calculated based on the 
Population and Per Capita Domestic Product (PCDP) respectively and the elasticity 
for trucks is calculated based on the Net State Domestic Product (NSDP).

Figure 3-3: Regression and Elasticity NSDP vs. Goods Traffic – extrapolation. 
Using the regression analysis above, we have arrived at the elasticity of traffic 
demand for each class of vehicle to a given change in relevant economic indicators. 
Average traffic growth of a vehicle class is multiplied by the corresponding elasticity 
coefficient to arrive at traffic growth. R 2is statistical measure of how close the data 
are to the fitted regression line. It varies from 0 to 1. The higher the value of R2 more 
representative is the regression model of data. 
The results of these analyses for the good fit as reflected by R 2 values are presented

3.4 Analysis of Historic Traffic Data 
Traffic growth on a particular section of the highway depends on a number of factors. 
Some of these are local and some have regional or national context. Regional or 
national economic development has a marked impact on traffic growth. Still, 
historical traffic volume data at the project highway provides a meaningful insight 
into traffic development on the corridor.  
Recently there has been tremendous up -gradation in the logistics industry in terms of 
processes, technology and mode of transportation. Improvement in road networks has 
opened the way for larger freight vehicles to be used for transportation of goods. This 
has added substantial value to logistical operations all across the country. It has been 
observed that the volume  of the typical 2 Axle truck has reduced and multi axle 
trucks or larger size have come in their place. This phenomenon is observed at 
project highway under study as well.  
The following historical traffic data have been used for our analysis. 
a) Traffic Numbers provided in Contract document pertaining to year 2008.  
b) Traffic Numbers provided in Report of Lea Associates pertaining to year 2010.  
c) Traffic Numbers provided in by conces sionaire pertaining to year 2016  to year 
upto March 2024 
Traffic numbers pertaining to tollable category of contract have been compared. 
The following tables provide historical traffic numbers at both toll plaza locations

3.5 Other Factors Influencing Growth 
There are many factors which have an impact  on traffic growth. As discussed 
previously these factors can be economic, social, educational, and industrial.  
Potentiality of such factors for project highway is discussed as under.   
Economy 
After witnessing a slowdown during 201 1-12, the economy recovered in 2013 -14, 
and a high growth rate of GDP was recorded in up to 2018 -19. Pandemic of COVID-
19 impacted all economies of world including India . Following figure show trend of 
GDP growth in India.

Six - Laning of Tumkur - Chitradurga Section of NH-4from Km 75.000 to Km 189.000 
FY 2017 -18 recorded a growth of 6.7% which had a slight  impact of GST and 
demonetization. Indian economy appears on recovery path with estimated growth of 
6.8% in FY 2018 -19.  The government  took major policy decisions including tax 
infrastructure reforming, banking sector improvement and ease of doing business.  
Major economies of world collapsed due to pandemic COVID -19 including India. 
Indian economy is also registered negative growth in financial year 2020 -21. After 
that Indian economy recovered handsomely and registered a growth of about 9% in 
Year 2021-22.  
          Key economic activities 
 
The Asset is situated in the state of Karnataka. It is situated to the north of 
Karnataka’s capital city – Bangalore – between Tumkur and Chitradurga. The Asset 
acts as a feeder for traffic between western Maharashtra, Gujarat and north -west 
India to Bangalore and south. 
The city of Chitradurga which is situated in a hilly region and experiences wind 
currents throughout the year makes it a suitable place to set up windmills and wind 
farms. There are several Wind-Power based power plants located around Chitradurga 
with the installed capacity of 49.7 MW. 
3.6 Recommended Growth Rates of Traffic 
The rate of growth is moderate in light of overall regional trends. Growth of multi-
Axle is kept slightly higher as trend of technological advances in logistic industry 
favors multi -axle over 2/3 axle carriage. It is also expected that as the economy 
moves from developing to developed, the rate of growth diminishes. Same growth 
rate is not sustainable for long. It is an established  practice to step down  future 
growth rates at suitable intervals of the year.  
Temporary disruptions caused by implementation of Goods and Service Tax (GST) 
and demonetization have dissipated, and growth of economy has significantly 
improved since then. Hence corridor can expect to have expected growth. 
Growth rates are recommended for three scenarios for sensitivity analysis namely 
Optimistic, Pessimistic  and Most Likely  with a positive and negative variation 
0.5% from Most Likely case.  
Based on the above analysis and after giving due consideration to the entire listed 
factors, the following overall growth rates are recommended for each category of 
vehicle as below.

4.2 Modification of Concession Period 
As per Article 29 of the concession agreement, if actual traffic on the project falls 
short or exceeds Target Traffic on project highway on defined date, concession 
period shall be modified subject to calculation stipulated therein. For Tumkur -
Chitradurga project, the Target Date and Target Traffic are defined as below: 
Target Date - 1st April 2020 
Target Traffic - 54558 in PCU 
It was observed that as per traffic projections, traffic volume falls short of Target 
Traffic in all scenarios. This warrants for extension of the concession period  as per 
provisions of concession agreement which is summarized as under - 
Scenario Projected Traffic in PCUs (average 
of traffic on target date, one year 
before target date and one year 
after target date)

Six - Laning of Tumkur - Chitradurga Section of NH-4from Km 75.000 to Km 189.000 
As per above , traffic and toll revenue have been considered assuming extension of 
5.2 years in the concession period . The said extension is subject to approval from 
NHAI. 
Due to the suspension of toll in the year FY -17 because of demonetization for a 
period of 24 days, the Concessionaire would be entitled to an extension  of an 
additional 24 days. 
Traffic was severely impacted on the project  highway during the initial  lockdown 
period. NHAI has declared a policy of providing extension of concessions to make up 
for revenue loss during lockdown. It is expected that extension will be provided to 
the project concession period on this account also.

(WPI) in India. Data has been taken from the Office of Economic Advisor web site 
(www.eaindustry.nic.in). WPI for years 2017-18 and 2018 -2019 is worked back by 
applying a correlation factor for 2004 -05 series as 2017 -18 and 2018 -2019 data is 
available in 2011-12 series only. Ratio of WPI for the year 2016-17 for both series is 
used for conversion of WPI in 2004-05 series.

CHAPTER 6  
OPERATION & MAINTENANCE 
6.1 Operation & Maintenance 
The following are project parameters which would contribute towards the cost of 
operation and maintenance. 
The estimated cost of operation and maintenance has been provided by the Management. 
The following are the key components for operation and maintenance costs: 
1. Annual Regular Maintenance  – Covering pothole repair, shoulder and slope repair, 
drain cleaning, median maintenance, Crash barrier, toll plaza maintenance, Toll 
collection, other services like medical help and rescue operations etc.  
2. Periodic Maintenance – This will be done on a periodic basis, say every 5 years. It 
will consist of overlaying of wearing course and painting and marking. Some pavement 
strengthening is also anticipated in a few sections.  This operation and its cost are spread 
over three years.  
The year wise actual operation and maintenance cost is provided by management of asset 
and has been found reasonable. Same has been adopted in report for projection of 
operation and maintenance cost.

CHAPTER 7  
CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATIONS 
7.1 Conclusion & Recommendations 
Project stretch of Tumkur to Chitradurga section of NH -4 in state of Karnataka from 
km 75.000 to km 189.000 is currently Six lane road. The road is in sound condition 
and serves to good traffic volume. As Indian economy is poised to grow at 7%+ post 
COVID-19, project corridor is expected to pick up same trend in terms of traffic 
flow.  All these developments have potential to give a positive impact to traffic flow 
on the project. Following can considered as major outcome of study: 
a) There is a good amount of tollable traffic running on the project. 
b) Project corridor has potential to witness  good traffic growth annually in near 
future in post COVID-19 scenario due to various development in area and overall 
development of economy. 
c) Project corridor has committed traffic as long route traffic and does not have risk 
of traffic leakage due lack of competing road of comparable quality. 
The project infrastructure is in good condition  and its maintenance cost is also 
reasonable.  
Based on the above it can be considered a stable healthy project from the traffic and 
revenue point of view.

CHAPTER 1  
INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
The Government of India through National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) 
embarked upon a program to enhance the traffic capacity and safety for efficient 
transportation of goods as well as passenger traffic on National Highway Sections under 
NHDP Phase V. Under Phase V NHAI has planned to convert 6,500 km of existing 4 -
lane National Highways into 6 -lane National Highway. Sections envisaged under 6 -
laning comprise the Golden Quadrilateral section (5,700 km) and some other sections 
which are 800 km in length. 
The project under consideration, Omalur - Namakkal section of NH -7 from Km 
180.000 to km 248.625 is one such road project NHAI intended to implement on a BOT 
basis in the DBFOT format. Project has concession period of 20 years. Project achieved 
COD on 6 th August-2009. The Project has been commissioned and is currently in the 
operation / maintenance phase . Project under consideration is a combination of 
construction and maintenance packages as given under 
Maintenance package – From Km 180.000 to Km 207.500 
Construction & Maintenance Package – From Km 207.500 to Km 248.625 
Asset and regional context 
The Asset is a 68.625 km, 4 -lane stretch on NH-44 in the state of Tami Nadu. It serves 
as a key connector between key cities along the North-South corridor such as Bangalore 
(to the north of Omallur) and Salem/Namakkal (to the south of Omallur). The project 
stretch connects Hyderabad, Bangalore in the North to Salem, Namakkal, Karur, 
Chennai and Kanyakumari in the South. There is one toll plaza on the Asset – TP 
Omallur. It is located about 15 km to the north of Salem city. The Asset lies to the south 
of Omallur town and therefore witnesses traffic between the two urban areas.  
This Asset primarily serves long-distance traffic from Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, 
Bangalore in  the North to Salem, Chennai and Kanyakumari in the South, with 
commercial vehicles 3A and MAV dominating the movement. Local commercial traffic 
movement is reported from Salem mining area. 
The highest contributor for revenue is MAVs followed by CJVs. The primary growth 
drivers of commercial traffic on the Asset are: 
• Industrial activity in Salem city and other areas such as Namakkal;

2.2 Classified Traffic Volume Count 
The objective of conducting a Classified Traffic Volume Count is to understand the 
traffic flow pattern including modal split on a roadway. The Classified Traffic Volume 
Count survey has been provided by concessionaire of project highway from actual 
traffic data gathered at toll plaza locations based on monthly data shared with NHAI. 
These locations are indicated in Figure 2-1 and listed in Table 2-1. 
The vehicles can broadly be classified into fast moving / motorized and slow moving / 
non-motorized vehicles, which can be further classified into specific categories of 
vehicles. The groupings of vehicles are further segregated to capture the tollable vehicle 
categories specifically and toll exempted vehicles are counted separately. The detailed 
vehicle classification system as per IRC: 64-1990 is given in Table 2-2.  
Table 2-2 : Vehicle Classification System

However, since the project highway is currently under toll operation, the data collected 
corresponds to the category of tollable vehicles. The following are the types of vehicles 
as per concession agreement.  
• Car / Jeep / Van 
• LCV 
• Truck / Bus 
• Multi Axle

2.3 Traffic Characteristic 
Toll revenue of project highway does not solely depend on traffic volume. There are 
certain characteristics of traffic which have substantial potential to affect toll collection. 
Component of local traffic, component of passenger and commercial traffic, portion of 
return journey traffic, % of monthly pass traffic are some of such characteristics of 
traffic. These will be discussed in subsequent sections of the report. 
2.3.1 Traffic Data 
Project concessionaire has provided Traffic data for base year 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-
18, 2018 -19, 2019-20, 2020 -21, 2021-22, 2022-23, 2023 -24 2024-25 & traffic data 
from April 2025 to September 2025. 
Since the traffic data available for this update is for only Annual, from April 2025 to 
September 2025, it may not represent the whole year traffic. Hence a seasonality factor 
for balance part of year has been applied to average traffic of the current Six months to 
arrive at Annual Average Daily Traffic of base year 2025 -26. Thus, corrected traffic is 
used for future projections and revenue calculations. The following table  shows 
historical traffic on project stretch and derived Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) 
for year 2025-26.

It can be observed from above that proj ect traffic has PCU index near 2 which is a fair 
indicator of good mix being split between commercial and urban traffic. 
2.4.2 Components of Traffic 
As discussed previously, components of traffic volume play an important role in 
determining project revenue. A larger component of commercial traffic with higher axle 
configuration adds to project revenue positively. Similarly, a larger component of local 
traffic affects the project revenue potential negatively. 
For the purpose of analysis, the recent traffic numbers of for period from April 2023 to 
September 2023 have been considered as the base numbers. 
It is observed that c ar traffic forms 70% of total traffic at toll plaza location Km 
191.800 LCV and bus / truck share 7% and 12% respectively. Multi axle consists of 
11% of total traffic.  Overall, about 30% of traf fic is commercial in nature.  A higher  
percentage of urban traffic is due to the p roject corridor passing through the city of 
Salem which is a fast-upcoming urban C category town. 
Another important bifurcation of traffic is components of traffic with respect to various 
type of toll ticketing like 
1. Single Journey

The s ingle journey component in total traffic numbers is a s high as 59% while the 
return journey component is 27%. The monthly pass share is as low as 2% and Annual 
Pass car is 12% . As the p roject corridor serves as primary link for traffic between 
Madurai and Bangalore  the component of single journey ticket is much higher . 
Moreover, the toll  structure of the project  is based on old toll policy and there are 
special rates for local single journey traffic . This makes the option of a monthly pass 
less attractive. 
2.5 Secondary Data Collection 
There are several other factors which have a substantial impact on traffic patterns and 
growth on any project corridor. The following are some of such important factors. 
• Industrial development around project corridor and its catchment 
• Educational infrastructure along project corridor 
• Demographic pattern 
• Urban area development 
• Tourism potential 
• Upcoming major infrastructural or industrial projects 
• Special industry in project corridor  
• Overall trends of economic growth local as well as national / regional

Hence in addition to traffic details on the project site, secondary data was also collected 
from the various sources. Typical secondary data includes the following: 
1. Vehicle registration data of regional and national level. 
2. Economic Data 
a) GDP 
b) NSDP 
c) Population Growth 
d) Per Capita Income growth 
e) Industrial Growth 
f) Special Industry Potential 
g) Regional and National development vision / plan  
h) Any other relevant data  
3. Competing road network. 
We have collected and utilized such underlying data in the study to estimate the growth 
and risk factors for traffic along the project corridor.

CHAPTER 3  
GROWTH OF TRAFFIC ON PROJECT HIGHWAY 
3.1 Introduction 
Traffic growth is a function of the interplay of a number of contributory factors such as 
National economy, Government policy, socio -economic conditions of the people, and 
changes in land uses along the project corridor precincts etc. As these factors have a 
number of uncertainties associated with them, forecasts of traffic are dependent on the 
forecasts of factors such as population, gross domestic product (GDP), vehicle 
ownership, per capita income (PCI), agricultural output, fuel consumption etc. Future 
patterns of change in these factors can be estimated with only a reasonable degree of 
accuracy and hence the resultant traffic forecast levels may not be precise.  
Traffic growth forecast for project corridor Omalur - Namakkal section of NH -7 has 
been carried out  taking the above  factors into consideration. “IRC: 108 -2015-
Guidelines for Traffic Prediction on Rural Highways ” is established best practice 
and has been used for traffic growth forecast. 
3.2 Trend Analysis 
One of the methods of estimation of future rate of traffic growth is to assume the same 
rate of growth as experienced in the past. However, it may be noted that major 
influencing factors which reflect Economic conditions such as GDP, agricultural output, 
industrial output, national policies etc. are susceptible to change over a longer period of 
time and necessary adjustments need to be made to past trends to account for these 
changes.  
Thus, we have considered the Elasticity model of growth projection which is one of the 
most widely acceptable methods for traffic forecast and is recommended in IRC: 108-
2015-Guidelines for Traffic Prediction on Rural Highways. 
In this method past trends of any vehicular data are paired with an economic indicator 
and a regression analysis is done to yield the economic mo del of growth. Growth of 
vehicular traffic varies for different types of vehicles. It is a proven fact that growth 
patterns for passenger and goods vehicles are different. Traffic growth on any highway 
typically depends on a number of economic parameters. The most important and direct 
parameters are given as below

• Per Capita Income  
• Net State Domestic Product (NSDP) 
• Population 
It is observed that the ownership of a car is more closely related to affordability hence 
per capita is the index which closely fits with growth of car traffic among other criteria. 
In similar fashion, the following pairs of vehicle type and independent variable can be 
established for elasticity modeling of growth. 
• Car / Jeep – Par Capita Income  
• Bus / Minibus – Population 
• Trucks / Heavy / Goods Vehicle – NSDP 
• Time series data of vehicle (both passenger and goods) Registered in the state 
of Tamil Nadu is used as the base data for analysis of growth. 
3.3 Estimation of Traffic Demand Elasticity 
The elasticity of traffic demand is defined as the rate at which traffic intensity varies 
due to change in the correspond ing indicator selected. Hence, i n order to estimate the 
elasticity of traffic demand, it is necessary to establish the relationship between the 
growth in number of given categories of vehicle with one of the economic variables 
considered, such as NSDP, per capita income and population growth. Latest available 
data for vehicle registration, per capita income, NSDP and population is used in 
analysis. 
As per IRC: 108 -2015 the model for estimating elasticity index for the project corridor 
is of the following form and is as given below: 
Log (P) = k x Log (EI) + A 
Where,   
P  =Number of Vehicles (Mode wise) 
EI  =Economic Indicator 
A  =Regression constant  
k  = Elasticity coefficient (Regression coefficient)  
The elasticity for cars and buses (passenger vehicles) is calculated based on Population 
and Per Capita Domestic Product (PCDP) and the elasticity for trucks is calculated 
based on the Net State Domestic Product (NSDP).  
The following tables and graphs depict regression and elasticity of growth model.

Using the regression analysis above, we have arrived at the elasticity of traffic demand 
for each class of vehicle to a given change in relevant economic indicators. Average 
traffic growth of a vehicle class is multiplied by the corresponding elasticity coefficient 
to arrive at traffic growth. R 2 is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the 
fitted regression line. It varies from 0 to 1. The higher  the value of R 2 more 
representative is the regression model of data.  
The results of these analyses for the good fit as reflected by R 2 values are presented in 
the Table below.

While the economic model for predicting growth is a good tool, other local, regional, 
national factors such as proposed developments etc. should also be considered before 
finalizing growth factors. These factors are discussed in subsequent sections. 
3.4 Analysis of Historic Traffic Data 
Historic traffic data forms useful information for any highway project. It provides 
useful information for establishing past trends of growth. Project stretch of Omalur to 
Namakkal has been commissioned and it has been under tolled operation since 2009.

3.5 Other Factors Influencing Growth 
There are many factors which have an impact on traffic growth. As discussed 
previously these factors can be economic, social, educational, and industrial.  
Potentiality of such factors for project highway is discussed as under.   
ECONOMY 
After witnessing a slowdown during 2011-12, the economy recovered in 2013-14, and a 
high growth rate of GDP was recorded up to 2018 -19. Pandemic of COVID -19 
impacted all economies of world including India . Following figure show trend of GDP 
growth in India. 
 
Figure 3-4 : Growth of GDP in India 
FY 2017 -18 recorded a growth of 6.7% which had a slight  impact of GST and 
demonetization. Indian economy appears on recovery path with estimated growth of 
6.8% in FY 2018 -19.  The government  took major policy decisions including tax 
infrastructure reforming, banking sector improvement and ease of doing business.  
Major economies of world collapsed due to pandemic COVID -19 including India. 
Indian economy is also registered negative growth in financial year 2020 -21. After that 
Indian economy recovered handsomely and registered a growth of about 9% in Year 
2021-22.

             Key economic activities 
Salem also known as the ‘Manchester of South India’, is a key economic centre of Tamil 
Nadu. The following sectors are key economic drivers in the region: 
 
• Mining: Salem is situated between Dharmapuri in north and Trichy and 
Namakkal in South.  It is key mineral ore zone for minerals extraction of 
Magnesite, Bauxite, Granite, Limestone, Quartz and Iron ore. 
• Steel: iron ore from Kanchamalai feeds the Salem Steel Plant located in the area. 
Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) has one of its largest steel plants in 
Salem. 
• Agricultural produce: Mango fruits, Tapioca, Coffee, Sandalwood from 
Salem are world popular. Sago, sabudana, and other starch production units are 
located around Salem city and are transported to various parts of North India. 
• Cottage Industries: The Salem handloom industry is one of the ancient, 
producing quality sarees and dhotis out of silk yarn and cotton yarn. Its Sun-
bleached sugar- vellam - Nattu Sarkarai is a major cottage industry with export-
oriented units' setup. 
• Automobile parts: Namakkal is home to one of the largest lorry body 
manufacturing workshops in the country. In addition, automobile parts and 
commercial vehicle tires are manufactured here. 
3.6 Recommended Growth Rates of Traffic 
Based on the above analysis and after giving due consideration to the entire listed 
factors, the following overall growth rates are recommended for each category of 
vehicle as below. The rate  of growth is moderate in light of overall regional trends. 
Growth of multi-Axle is kept slightly higher as trend of technological advances in 
logistic industry favors multi -axle over 2/3 axle carriage. It is also expected that as the 
economy moves from developing to developing, the rate  of growth diminishes. The 
same growth rate is not sustainable for long. It is established practice to step down 
future growth rates at suitable intervals of years. 
Temporary disruptions caused by implementation of Goods and Service Tax (GST) and 
demonetization have dissipated, and growth of economy has significantly improved 
since then. Hence the corridor can have the expected growth.

4.2 Extension of Concession Period 
15 days of extension in concession period has been approved by NHAI due to floods in 
Chennai in December 2015. Due to the suspension in toll in the year FY17 because of 
demonetization for a period of 24 days, the Concessionaire would be entitled to an 
extension of an additional 24 days. Traffic was severely impacted on the project highway 
during the covid lockdown period. NHAI has declared a policy of providing extension of 
concession to make up for revenue loss during lockdown. It is expected that a n extension 
would be provided to project concession period on this account as well.

CHAPTER 7  
CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATIONS 
7.1 Conclusion & Recommendations 
Project stretch of Omalur to Namakkal section of NH -7 in state of Tamil  Nadu from 
km 180.000 to km 248.625 is presently a four-lane road. The road is in sound 
condition and serves healthy traffic volumes. The project corridor is a part of critical 
North – South connectivity via national highway NH -7. Bangalore has already 
emerged as the IT  capital of country and the project stretch falls in its catchment. 
There are many upcoming projects in the area which are proposed to boost economic 
growth of the area  and add value to the development  of the region. All the 
developments considered in the Report have the potential to have a positive impact on 
the traffic flow on the project. The following can be considered as major outcome of 
study. 
a) There is a healthy volume of tollable traffic running on the project. 
b) Project corridor has the potential to witness good traffic growth annually in the 
post COVID-19 scenario  due to various developments in area and overall 
development of economy. 
c) Project corridor does not have risk of traffic leakage due to lack of competing 
roads of comparable quality.  
The project infrastructure is in good condition and its maintenance cost is also 
reasonable.  
Based on the above it can be considered a stable healthy project from the traffic and 
revenue point of view.

of IRBPA. Subsequently, NHAI filed appeal under section 37 of Arbitration and Conciliation 
Act, 1996 before Delhi High Court challenging the order dated March 8, 2022. The Delhi High 
Court pursuant to its order dated July 3, 2023 set aside the Award. IRBPA redeposit the arbitral

by NHAI which led to invocation of arbitration. MVR filed a claim to the tune of ₹ 51.44 
million towards positive change of scope for construction of additional arm of flyover and 
2.46 million towards negative change of scope on account of deletion of 19 hume pipe culverts. 
Pursuant to an award dated February 17, 2022, NHAI was directed to pay ₹ 48.97 million. 
NHAI challenged the arbitral award under Section 34 which was dismissed by the Delhi High 
Court. Thereafter, NHAI further appealed aga inst the Section 34 judgment under Section 37 
in the Delhi High Court which was also dismissed pursuant to order dated August 9, 2023 but 
a liberty was granted to NHAI to file a review petition against the judgment. The review 
petition filed by NHAI is currently pending. NHAI filed an application on February 28, 2020 
seeking permission to submit an additional counter Claim in the arbitration under above 
matter. The Arbitral Tribunal directed that the amendment to NHAI's counterclaim will be 
addressed in a s eparate proceeding, to run concurrently with the above matter. Separately,

before the Tribunal. 
 
II. Certain educational institutions have filed writ petitions before the Madras High Court 
challenging the toll fees levied by MVR in respect of their college buses. The Madras High 
Court has dismissed the writ petitions filed by 23 such institutions, holding  that the buses

for the concessional toll fee applicable to school buses. The remaining writ petitions on the 
same issue are currently pending before the Madras High Court.

Letter") seeking compensation of losses/ additional costs incurred as per the provisions of 
clause 29.2, clause 4.2 and clause 35. l of the concession agreement. However, as VKEL did

resolution mechanism under Article 38 of the concession agreement and issued a notice dated 
March 6,2023 invoking the conciliation procedure under Article 38.2 of the concession 
agreement. Thereafter, since no response was received from NHAI even after more than 30 days

the district collector, Ahmedabad, the State Public Works Department, Gandhinagar and 
others, seeking a permanent stay order on closing the Petitioner's access to the main 
carriage way. The matter is currently pending. 
 
II. IRBAV invoked arbitration against NHAI in relation to a competing road (the "Competing 
Road"). NHAI suggested that the matter be brought before the Conciliation Committee of 
Industrial Experts (the "CCIE"). IRBAV filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Co urt, 
which directed the parties to immediately refer the matter to arbitration. The Bombay High 
Court passed an order providing interim relief to IRBAV, granting a waiver with respect to 
the payment of premium for three months subject to the submission of an undertaking. The 
CCIE, pursuant to order dated May 29, 2019 concluded that the conciliation had failed. 
IRBAV subsequently invoked arbitration concerning the competing road as well as the 
issue of premium deferment and appointed an arbitrator. Thereafte r, IRBAV approached 
the Delhi High Court, pursuant to which the presiding arbitrator was appointed and the 
arbitral tribunal was constituted. Meanwhile, the interim relief earlier granted by the 
Bombay High Court in favour of IRBAV was extended. NHAI chall enged the Bombay 
High Court's order by filing a special leave petition before the Supreme Court of India, 
which was dismissed. IRBAV has further filed an application for interim relief and a 
statement of claims on March 1, 2021 requesting the arbitral tribunal ("Tribunal") to, inter­ 
alia, (a) declare that the NHAI is in breach of its obligations and representations under the 
concession agreement; and (b) direct the NHAI to pay compensation of ₹ 12.64 billion for 
the period between December 4, 2015 until De cember 31, 2020 with interest, NHAI has 
filed a counterclaim for an amount of (i) ₹ 562.2 million (until June 30, 2021) towards 
premium deferment; (ii) ₹ 5,026.1 million (until May 2021) and unpaid premium during 
the pendency proceedings as well as future premium; and (iii) ₹ 312.1 million towards 
interest (as on June 30, 2021). The arbitral tribunal passed an interim award dated October 
14, 2021, in favour of the IRBA V. IRBA V further updated the previously claimed amount 
to ₹ 21,232.70 million. The Tribu nal, vide its award dated April 7, 2024 ("Award"), 
declared that the Competing Road came into existence in January 2019 and not in the year 
2015-16, but due to technical reasons, no compensation was awarded to IRBA Von account 
of the Competing Road. IRBAV has challenged the Award under Section 34 of the 
Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996, specifically, to the extent of not deciding the claim 
under Clause 35.4 for compensation as claimed, despite having accepted the existence of 
Competing Road. The Delhi High Court, by its judgment dated February 11, 2025 
("Judgement") set aside the Award to that limited extent, fortifying the authority default, 
by permitting the IRBAV to  reinitiate arbitral proceedings with respect to their claim. 
Further, NHAI has challenged Judgement in its entirety. Both these appeals are 
pending. The Award further directed IRBA V to make payment of premium to NHAI 
as per the premium deferment scheme (counter claim no.2). The balance premium, if any, 
along with accrued interest at the b ank rate + 2% shall be paid once the debt servicing is 
completed and essentially one year before the completion of the concession period 
55 
 
 
including extension thereof. Whereas the counter claim no. l of NHAI for advancement of 
premium amounting to ₹ 297.30 million has been rejected by the Tribunal. Additionally, 
an amount on ₹ 190.00 million plus interest has been awarded to IRBA Von account of 
losses due to unwarranted retention of bank guarantee by NHAI and NHAI has been 
directed to return the said bank guarantee. Subsequently, NHAI challenged the Award 
dated April 7, 2024, under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, before 
the Delhi High Court, to the extent of the non -award of interest at the contractual rate on 
counter claim No. 2, as well as the rejection of counter claim No. 1. The matter is currently 
pending adjudication before the Delhi High Court. For the enforceme nt of the Award, 
NHAI filed a petition under Section 36 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 
("Section 36 Petition"), before the Delhi High Court, along with an application under Order 
XXI Rule 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Both matters  are currently pending 
adjudication before the Delhi High Court. As no interim relief was granted to NHAI under 
the Section 36 Petition, NHAI filed a special leave petition before the Supreme Court of 
lndia which was dismissed. 
 
IRBAV filed an application under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, 
with the Delhi High Court, which was disposed, granting liberty to IRBA V to treat the 
Section 9 application as Section 17 application before the existing arbitral tr ibunal 
constituted for the new claims. NHAI filed an application under Section 9 of the Arbitration 
and Conciliation Act, 1996, before the Delhi High Court seeking interim relief to secure 
the amount awarded under the Award, which was dismissed vide order dated October 18, 
2024, concluding that there is no direction in the Award to make forthwith/ upfront 
payment to NHAI and that the Award entitles IRBAV to pay differential revised annual 
premium later, only subject to payment of interest for the interregnu m. The Delhi High 
Court further directed that as per Rule 7 of the National Highway Fee Rules, read with the 
concession agreement permits withdrawal, towards payment of premium as per the 
waterfall mechanism envisaged therein. Therefore, any direction from  NHAI to IRBA V 
to pay the claimed amount upfront to NHAI would be violative of the concession 
agreement. NHAI filed a special leave petition before the Supreme Court of India to set 
aside the order of the Delhi High Court dated October 18, 2024, which was  dismissed. 
IRBA V has also initiated arbitration proceedings on certain other new claims including 
but not limited to execution of supplementary agreements to the concession agreement for 
extension of concession period, seeking adjustment of premium obligations and entitlement 
for revenue shortfall loan in accordance with the concession agreement. The matters are 
currently pending.

aggregating to ₹ 13,179.8 million towards, inter alia, compensation for delay in completion 
of construction due to the reasons attributable to NHAI, proportionate reduction in payment

RISK FACTORS 
 
(In this section “We”, “Our”, “InvIT” means “the Trust and/or Project SPVs owned by the Trust”) 
 
Risks Related to our Organization and the Structure of the Trust 
 
1. The debt financing provided by the Trust to each of the Project SPVs comprises of certain 
unsecured, interest free and interest-bearing loans as well as loans that is secured by a subordinate 
charge on (i) the cash flows deposited in the escrow account and  (ii) the escrow account of such 
Project SPV. The payment obligations of the respective Project SPVs in relation to such debt 
financing will be subordinated to all existing and future obligations of the Project SPVs towards 
any secured senior lenders.  
 
2. Any payment by the Project SPVs, including in an event of termination of the relevant concession 
agreement, is subject to a mandatory escrow arrangement which restricts their flexibility to utilize 
the available funds. 
 
3. We must maintain certain investment ratios, which may present additional risks to us. 
 
4. Traffic Consultant reports may not have fully factored the impact on account of newly proposed 
and upcoming highways, acting as competing facilities and consequently their negative impact on 
our project stretches might not have been correctly estimated. 
 
5. The Valuation Report, and any underlying reports, are not opinions on the commercial merits of 
the Trust or the Project SPVs, nor are they opinions, expressed or implied, as to the future trading 
price of the Units or the financial condition of the Trust u pon listing, and the valuation contained 
therein may not be indicative of the true value of the Project SPVs’ assets.

distributions to the Unitholders and the trading price of our Units. 
 
7. We may not be able to make distributions to Unitholders or the level of distributions may fall.  
 
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 
 
1. Our failure to extend applicable concession agreements or our inability to identify and acquire new

may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and 
our ability to make distributions. 
 
2. The Project SPVs’ toll-road concessions may be terminated prematurely under certain circumstances.

4. IRB Tumkur Chitradurga Tollway Limited (IRBTC) and M.V.R. Infrastructure and Tollways Limited 
(MVR) are required to pay annual premiums / negative grants in consideration for being granted the 
right to build and operate their respective projects. Failure to make such payments could result in the 
termination of the relevant concession agreement by the NHAI.

Trust Group with the Government or State Governments could materially and adversely affect our

11. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully undertake future acquisitions of road 
assets or efficiently manage the infrastructure road assets we have acquired or may acquire in the 
future.

Trust, which may present additional risks to us.

achieved more favourable terms if such transactions had been entered into with third parties.

movements of inflation indices in a relevant period and income from interest on the balance completion 
cost is linked with RBI Bank Rate. However, there are no specif ic provisions in our concession 
agreements protecting us against increases in interest rates or cost of raw materials except to the limited
