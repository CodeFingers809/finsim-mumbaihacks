SECTION II - RISK FACTORS 
 
An investment in equity shares involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider all the information  
disclosed in this Letter of Offer, including the risks and uncertainties described below and the " Financial 
Statements" on page 112 of this Letter of Offer, before making an investment in the Equity Shares. The risks  
described below are not the only risks relevant to us or the Equity Shares or the industries in which we currently 
operate. Additional risks and uncertainties, not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may 
also impair our business, cash flows, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. In order to obtain 
a complete understanding about us, investors should read this section in conjunction with " Our Business ", 
"Industry Overview " and " Management’s Discussion and Analysis of  Financial Condition and Results of  
Operations" beginning on pages 94, 80, and 170, respectively, as well as the other financial information included 
in this Letter of Offer. If any of the risks described below, or other risks that are not currently known or are  
currently deemed immaterial actually occur, our business, cash flows, prospects, results of operations and  
financial condition could be adversely affected, the trading price of the  Equity Shares could decline, and 
investors may lose all or part of the value of their investment. The financial and other related implications of the 
risk factors, wherever quantifiable, have been disclosed in the risk factors mentioned below. 
 
However, there are certain risk factors where the financial impact is not quantifiable and, therefore, cannot be  
disclosed in such risk factors. You should consult your tax, financial and legal advisors about the particular  
consequences to you of an investment in this Issue. The following factors have been considered for determining  
the materiality: (1) some events may not be material individually but may be found material collectively; (2) some 
events may have material impact qualitatively instead of quantitatively; and (3) some events may not be material 
at present but may have material impact in future. 
 
This Letter of Offer also contains forward -looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual  
results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward -looking statements as a result of certain  
factors, including the considerations described below and elsewhere in this Letter of Offer. Any potential investor  
in, and purchaser of, the Equity Shares should pay particular attention to the fact that our Company is an Indian 
company and is subject to a legal and regulatory environment which, in some respects, may be different from that 
which prevails in other countries. For further information, please refer to " Forward Looking Statements " 
beginning on page 16 of this Letter of Offer. 
 
Unless otherwise indicated or the context requires otherwise, the financial information included herein is based 
on our Restated Consolidated Financial Statements  for year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025  and 
limited review unaudited consolidated financial statements  for quarter ended June 30, 2025  included in this  
Letter of Offer. For further information, please refer to " Financial Statements" beginning on page 112 of this 
Letter of Offer. In this section, unless the context requires otherwise, any reference to "we", "us" or "our" refers 
to Indowind Energy  Limited. 
 
INTERNAL RISK FACTORS 
 
1. A significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among a limited number of utilities and power 
purchasers to whom we supply electricity. During the  Quarter June 30, 2025, FY 2024-25 and FY 
2023-24, our top five offtakers accounted for ₹256.20, ₹ 1378.80 lakhs and ₹ 1,920.37 lakhs of our 
total revenue, representing 22.20%, 41.14 %, and 49.36%, respectively. The loss of any of these key 
offtakers, or any deterioration in their financial health, could have an adverse impact on our business, 
financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
Since the transmission and distribution of electricity are controlled in most Indian jurisdictions by central 
and state government-utility companies, there is a concentrated pool of power purchasers for utility scale 
electricity generated by our wind plants and projects.  
 
The following is the revenue breakup on limited review unaudited consolidated financial statements basis 
for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, and restated audited financial statements for years ended, March 31, 
2025, and March 31, 2024, from our top five (5) and top ten (10) offtakers:

2.  % of total revenue from 
top ten (10) offtakers 
29.27% 48.77% 57.57% 
 
Although we have many new projects under construction, we expect that we will continue to be reliant 
on our top 10 offtakers for a large portion of our revenue. Accordingly, our business, results of operations 
and financial conditions could be adversely affected if our relationship with these top 10 offtakers is 
adversely affected. If any of these become unable or unwilling to fulfil their contractual obligations under 
the relevant PPA or refuse to accept power delivered under the PPAs or otherwise terminat e such 
agreements prior to the expiration thereof, our assets, liabilities, business, financial condition, results of 
operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.  
 
Although the central and state governments in India have taken steps to improve the liquidity, financial 
condition and viability of state electricity distribution utility companies, there can be no assurance that 
the utility companies that are currently ou r offtakers will have the resources to pay on time or at all. 
Furthermore, if the financial condition of these offtakers deteriorates or other government policies to 
which they are currently subject to change, demand for electricity produced by our utility-scale projects 
could be adversely impacted. 
 
2. Our business performance and profitability are closely tied to the availability and pricing of wind 
turbine generators, components, equipment, and other essential materials /services used in our wind 
projects. We rely on third -party suppliers to fulfil these requirements, with our top five suppliers 
contributing ₹ 321.85 lakhs and ₹ 134.08 lakhs to our total direct costs, accounting for 23.46 % and 
9.05 %, during the  Fiscal 202 5, and Fiscal 202 4, respectively. Any delays, disruptions, or price 
fluctuations in the supply of these items could materially affect our business operations, financial 
condition, and overall performance.

Based on Limited Review Unaudited Consolidated Financials for quarter ended June 30, 2025 and Restated Consolidated Financial 
Information for Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024. See “Financial Information” on page 112. 
Supplies also include installation, transportation and Operation & Maintenance services as per service agreements. 
Suppliers include engineering, procurement, and construction (“EPC”) contractors. 
 
 
3. We rely on third-party suppliers and our in-house team to maintain our key equipment. Any failure 
of our operations and maintenance contractors or personnel to provide adequate operations and 
maintenance services, or our inability to hire or retain qualified operations and maintenance 
personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance. 
 
Our WEG suppliers are contractually obligated to provide operational and maintenance services for a set 
time period after each WEG enters into operation, pursuant to which they undertake to conduct (i) 
scheduled and unscheduled maintenance in accordance with day -to-day ope rational guidelines and 
maintenance routines and (ii) component repair or replacement. After the expiration of supplier 
maintenance, we may sub-contract operations and maintenance to third parties or use our in-house team.  
 
The expenses incurred by us towards WEG maintenance and replacements parts during the quarter ended 
June 30, 2025, financial year 2025 and 2024 are provided below:

If the third -party suppliers or our in -house operations and maintenance team were to fail to provide inspection, 
maintenance or repair works for our key equipment and systems in a timely manner or at all, our power generation 
and business operation could be interrupted or delayed, possibly without warning. In addition, we may be unable 
to hire or retain qualified operations and maintenance personnel. The occurrence of any of these events could have 
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
4. Our Power Purchase Agreements (“PPA’s”) may expose us to certain risks that may adversely affect 
our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, our revenue from operations 
is exposed to fixed tariffs, changes in tariff regulation and structuring 
 
Under our long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs), we typically supply electricity generated from 
our power plants to  state distribution companies, and certain corporate customers. If we fail to 
commence power supply by the scheduled commissioning date (including any permitted extensions) as 
stipulated in the PPAs, such failure could lead to termination of the un -commissioned capacity by the 
offtaker.  
 
Additionally, in cases where we seek an extension of the PPA term, we may not have the opportunity 
to renegotiate or secure a higher tariff under the revised terms. 
 
Our profitability largely depends on our ability to efficiently manage costs over the term of our power 
purchase agreements (PPAs) and operate our power projects at optimal performance levels. Any 
inability to control costs or ensure efficient operations c ould adversely impact our business, financial 
condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Additionally, our PPAs typically grant the offtakers 
the right to terminate the agreement or impose penalties, fines, or other charges upon the occurrence of 
specified events. These may include, among others, failure to maintain controlling shareholding, 
complete project construction or grid connectivity within stipulated timelines, meet minimum power 
supply obligations, adhere to operation and maintenance standa rds, obtain required regulatory 
approvals and licenses, comply with technical grid parameters, or fulfil other material obligations under 
the respective PPAs. 
 
In instances of PPA termination where we are entitled to receive termination payments from a 
counterparty or distribution company due to such counterparty’s or distribution company’s material 
breach, there can be no certainty that such counterparty or distribution company will make such 
23 
payments on time or at all. Further, it is unlikely that termination payments will be adequate to pay 
all the outstanding third-party debt that we have borrowed for the project. 
 
Our PPAs are currently linked to the tariff rates of T amil Nadu Electricity Board (“TNEB”), and 
accordingly, any revision in TNEB tariffs may result in a corresponding revision in our selling rates. 
However, in the event of an industry -wide increase in tariffs or when seeking an extension of the PPA 
term, we may not have the ability to renegotiate the terms of our PPAs to benefit from higher prevailing 
market tariffs. Additionally, increased operational costs may not necessarily translate into a 
corresponding increase in tariffs unless such revisions fall within the scope of a “change in law” 
provision under the PPA. Any such increase would require regulatory approvals, which may be time -
consuming and subject to procedural delays. While there are currently no restrictions on seeking such 
revisions, the process involves approvals from the relevant  regulatory commission. Further, we may 
face challenges in recovering increased costs (whether through tariff revisions or legal recourse) from 
central or state government -owned intermediaries, distribution companies, or authorities in a timely 
manner. Although we have not encountered such issues in the past, delays or resistance from regulators 
could lead to disputes and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, 
and cash flows 
 
All the above factors limit our business flexibility, expose us to an increased risk of unforeseen business 
and industry changes and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition 
and cash flows. 
 
5. Our Promoters and our Company has no prior experience in developing and operating solar energy 
projects. In the event that our Promoters or our Company are  unable to understand the market 
operations and the risks related to the same, our business, financial performance and cash flows may 
be affected. 
 
Since inception, our Company has been carrying on the business of developing, owning and operating 
wind energy power plants. Accordingly, our Promoters mainly hold experience in the aforementioned 
offerings and have no prior experience in developing and operating solar energy projects. 
 
Our Company depends on the management skills and guidance of our Directors and Promoters for 
development of business strategies, monitoring its successful implementation and meeting future 
challenges. Accordingly, we are highly dependent upon our Directors  and Promoters for our business 
operations and strategic expansion. 
 
Our Company proposes to set up 4 MW solar power plant in Karnataka State, India of an estimated total 
project cost of ₹ 2,150.00 lakhs, which is proposed to be funded entirely from the Net Proceeds of this 
Issue. For details in respect of the solar project, please refer to “ Objects of the Issue - To set up 4 MW 
solar power plant in Karnataka State.” on page 66. 
 
We are presently and are likely to be for a s short period of time, dependent on the technical knowledge 
and expertise of contractors, operations and maintenance (O&M) service providers, panel & other 
suppliers and other consultants, who have substantially more experience in developing and building solar 
energy projects. Owing to the lack of experience of our Company and our Promoters in developing and 
operating solar energy projects, we may be exposed to risks such as, difficulty in understanding the 
demand and supply patterns and marketing segments which may pose a risk in the smooth operation, and 
working of our project.  
 
Further, we may face challenges related to unforeseen expenses, difficulties, the location of project, 
availability of panels and other components, complications and delays encountered while commissioning 
the project and the commencement of operations of a  new business. We cannot assure, that we can 
manage such challenges in developing and operating our projects effectively. Any failure to manage such 
challenges could delay our ability to meet our customers’ requirements and delay our ability to generate 
revenue from such projects, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial 
condition and results of operations.  
 
24 
Furthermore, t he successful implementation of this project is contingent upon securing  regulatory 
approvals, amanaging technology-related uncertainties, and controlling costs and timelines. There is no 
guarantee that this new venture will be executed as planned or that it will yield positive contributions to 
the Company’s overall business or financial performance. 
 
 
 
6. Certain of our wind energy generators have been operational for over 25 years and may be impacted 
by regulatory actions from TANGEDCO regarding older WEGs. 
 
A portion of our installed wind energy capacity comprises WEGs that have been in operation for over 25 
years. The Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (“TANGEDCO”) has recently 
issued a circular proposing the discontinuation of WEGs that have been in operation for more than 20 
years. This circular has been challenged by various WEG associations and is currently under dispute.  
 
If implemented, this directive could require us to shut down or replace some of our older WEGs 
prematurely, even if they remain technically viable and operationally efficient. Such a development could 
adversely impact our generation capacity, revenue from affected projects, and require unplanned capital 
expenditure to upgrade or replace decommissioned assets. Additionally, uncertainty regarding the 
regulatory framework for older WEGs in Tamil Nadu may impact our ability to plan future investments 
and operations in the region, potentially affecting our long-term business strategy and profitability. 
 
7. We face significant competition from both traditional and renewable energy companies and any failure 
to respond to market changes in the renewable energy industry could adversely affect our business, 
financial conditions and results of operations. 
 
We face intense competition in the renewable energy sector, primarily from Indian and global developers 
and operators of solar, wind, and other renewable energy projects. The deregulation of the Indian power 
sector, particularly through reforms introduced under the Electricity Act, 2003, has increased competition 
by removing certain licensing requirements for power generation, enabling open access to transmission 
and distribution networks, and facilitating capacity additions through captive power projects. These 
regulatory developments, along with potential future reforms, continue to encourage greater private 
sector participation, thereby intensifying market competition. 
 
Our competitors may have access to superior operational, financial, technical, and managerial resources, 
enabling them to achieve greater economies of scale and a lower cost of capital. This often allows them 
to bid more competitively in auctions, sometime s at margins that we may be unable or unwilling to 
match. Additionally, some of our competitors may have a stronger local presence, more established 
relationships, or a greater risk appetite, enabling them to sustain operations with minimal or even negative 
margins over extended periods. 
 
The competitive landscape may also be altered through strategic alliances, joint ventures, or mergers 
involving our competitors and key suppliers or contractors. Such consolidations could limit our options 
and reduce flexibility in project execution. As th e industry continues to evolve, we may also encounter 
new entrants, including players from adjacent sectors or emerging technologies, which could further 
challenge our market position. 
 
Moreover, we compete not only within the renewable energy segment but also with conventional power 
producers using fossil fuels. As of December 2024 , grid-connected renewable energy —including large 
hydro—accounted for approximately 47% of India's total installed generation capacity, while traditional 
fossil fuel-based sources comprised about 52.6%. (Source: Power Sector at a glance, Ministry of Power, 
February 2025) A decline in the cost of coal, oil, natural gas, or other fossil fuels could reduce the demand 
for renewable energy, impacting tariffs, project viability, and overall competitiveness. Any increase in 
competition or reduction in our ability to compete effec tively may adversely affect our market share, 
project profitability, and overall business performance. 
 
8. We have not yet placed orders/made payment in relation to ₹ 2,150.00 Lakhs to be incurred to set up 
of the 4 MW (AC) Solar power project. In the event of any delay in placing the orders, or in the event 
25 
the vendors are not able to provide the equipment in a timely manner, or at all, the same may result in 
time and cost over-runs. 
 
We intend to utilize part of the Net Proceeds to set up 4 MW solar power plant in Karnataka State.. While 
we have obtained quotations from the vendor in relation to the 4 MW (AC) Solar power Project, we have 
not placed firm orders for them.  
 
We are yet to make order / payment for the capital expenditure ₹ 2,150.00 Lakhs to be incurred for the 
project. We will also continue placing the orders as and when deemed appropriate by the management. 
Such quotations are valid for a certain period of time and may be subject to revisions, and other 
commercial and technical factors. We cannot assure that we will b e able to undertake such capital 
expenditure at the costs indicated by such quotations or that there will not be cost escalations over and 
above the contingencies proposed to be funded out of the Net Proceeds. 
 
Further, the actual amount and timing of our future capital  requirements may differ from our estimates 
as a result of, among other things, unforeseen delays or cost overruns, unanticipated expenses, regulatory 
changes, engineering design changes and technological changes, inadequate performance of the 
machineries installed, delays in completion, defects in design or construction, taxes and duties, interest 
and finance charges, working capital margin and other external factors which may not be within the 
control of our management. 
 
In the event of any delay in placing the orders, or an escalation in the cost of acquisition of the equipment, 
or in the event the vendor  is not able to provide the equipment in a timely manner, or at all, we may 
encounter time and cost overruns. Further, if we are unable to procure equipment or avail services from 
the vendor from whom we have obtained quotations, we cannot assure you that we may be able to identify 
alternative vendors to provide us with the similar kind of equipment and services, which sat isfy our 
requirements at acceptable prices. 
 
For further details, please see “Objects of the Issue” on page 64. 
 
9. Our Company will apply for the approvals, clearances and permissions as may be required from the 
relevant authorities for the proposed solar project. In the event our Company is unable to obtain such 
approvals and permits, our business, results of operatio ns, cash flows and financial condition could 
be adversely affected. 
 
Our Company proposes to set up 4 MW solar power plant in Karnataka State. We intend to use a major 
part of the Issue proceeds to set up this 4 MW (AC) Solar power plant. The estimated total project cost 
of developing the project is ₹  2,150.00 lakhs. We have received a proposal from Soleos Solar Energy 
Private Limited, an EPC contractor, to set up the 4 MW (AC)  Solar power plant . For further details, 
please see "Objects of the Issue" on page 64. 
 
Our Company has made an application to Karnataka Renewable Energy Development Limited 
(“KREDL”) for allotment for solar project in Karnataka state along with project documents and payment 
of applicable fees. 
 
We are required to obtain certain approvals for setting up the Power Project. For further details, please 
refer to the section titled “Government and Other Statutory Approvals” on page 187. 
 
In case, if we are unable to obtain the requisite approval s for the proposed location, we will identify an 
alternate location, in consultation with Electricity Department, Karnataka,  for grid to be set up on our 
owned land or land leased from third parties or any nearest place and use the proceeds for the same. This 
may cause the actual cost of set up to exceed the estimated costs due to a variety of factors such as 
acquisition of land , construction delays, cost escalation of raw material, interest rates, l abour costs, 
regulatory and environmental factors, and weather conditions. 
 
Further, the quotation from the EPC contractor for execution of the Solar Power Project may expire and 
we may be compelled to obtain a fresh quotation. Our financial condition, results of operations and 
liquidity may be materially and adversely affected if  our project or construction costs materially exceed 
26 
such budgeted amounts. For further details, please refer to chapters titled ― " Objects of the Issue" and 
"Government and other Approvals" on pages 64 and 187, respectively of this Letter of Offer. 
 
10. Due to seasonal nature of the industry we operate in, we may not be able to achieve complete utilisation 
of the windmills owned and operated by us, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our 
business, prospects, financial condition and results of operation.  
 
As regards the existing wind business, due to the inherent nature of this business and uncertainty of 
factors such as machine availability, wind availability, grid availability, climatic conditions  and air 
density factor, etc., we may not be able to achieve complete capacity utilisation of the windmills owned 
and operated by us and of the proposed wind power project. Therefore, the installed capacity is not 
expected to provide the same generation throughout the year for our Company . The various factors that 
affect the generation of power are machine availability, wind availability, climatic conditions, grid 
availability and air density factor. Wind availability, intensity of the sunlight, and air density factors are 
climate driven and suc h factors could impact the power generation. The generation during the peak 
season will be high and will reduce significantly during the lean season. Our windmills located in Tamil 
Nadu and Karnataka usually reach peak electricity output in the months of May to September, and lowest 
electricity output in the months of October to April. 
 
The viability of wind power projects is dependent on the wind patterns, which vary based on location 
and time. Wind power business generates revenue primarily from the sale of electricity generated by 
windmills. The amount of electricity generated by, and the profitability of, our windmills depend on 
climatic conditions, particularly wind conditions, which can vary dramatically across the seasons. 
Presently, WEGs will only begin to operate when wind speeds reach a certain minimum speed and must 
be disconnec ted when wind speeds exceed a certain maximum speed. Therefore, if wind speeds are 
outside these limits, the electricity output from our windmills will decrease or cease.  
 
If the seasonal variations and fluctuations in wind conditions of these areas do not conform to our 
historical observations or do not correspond to our assumptions, it may result in unexpected fluctuations 
in the electricity output of such windmills and co nsequently, our results of operations. These seasonal 
variations in consumer demand subject our sector to a considerable degree of volatility.  Similarly, 
extreme wind or weather conditions, particularly those affecting multiple windmills, could reduce our 
operational efficiency and electricity production, which could have a material adverse effect on our 
business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
11. We have not entered into any definitive arrangements for the sale of electricity to be generated through 
our proposed solar power project, which may affect our revenue generation and project viability.  
 
We are in the process of setting up a solar power plant, which is expected to form a part of our future 
business operations and revenue streams.  Our Company proposes to set up 4 MW solar power plant in 
Karnataka State., India. However, as on the date of this  Letter of Offer , we have not entered into any 
power purchase agreements ("PPAs") or other definitive arrangements for the sale of electricity to be 
generated from the solar power project.  
 
Further, the commercial viability of the project is substantially dependent on our ability to secure such 
offtake arrangements on competitive terms. Any delay or inability in entering into such agreements may 
result in underutilization of the project’s capacity, delay in achieving break-even, or impact on the return 
on investment. This could, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of 
operations. 
 
12. We cannot assure you that the proposed solar project which is proposed to be funded from the Net 
Proceeds will become operational as scheduled, or at all, or operate as efficiently as planned. If we 
are unable to commission our new project in a timely mann er or without cost overruns, it may 
adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition . 
 
Our Company proposes to set up 4 MW solar power plant in Karnataka State,, India of an estimated total 
project cost of ₹ 2,150.00 lakhs, which is proposed to be funded entirely from the Net Proceeds of this 
Issue.  
27 
 
Our Company plans site development along with creating requisite civil structure at an estimated cost of 
₹ 200.00 Lakh. The major work involves Land Levelling, Development & Conversion work, including 
liasoning for Project related work. 
 
For details in respect of the solar project, please refer to “Objects of the Issue - To set up 4 MW solar 
power plant in Karnataka State.” on page 66. 
 
In the event of any delay in the schedule of implementation or if we are unable to complete the project 
as per the scheduled time, it could lead to revenue loss for us. If the proposed project is not commissioned 
at the scheduled time, our Company may face cash crunch. Furthermore, in the event of shortfall of funds 
or delay in commissioning of the proposed project, we may have to reduce the capacity of the proposed 
project in order to reduce costs and expediate timely completion of the project. While we ma y seek to 
minimize the risks from any unanticipated events, it cannot be assured that all potential delays could be 
mitigated and that we will be able to prevent any cost over -runs and any loss of profits resulting from 
such delays, shortfalls and disruptions. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations 
and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. 
 
13. Our in -house procurement operations for wind projects expose us to certain risks. We may incur 
unexpected expenses if the suppliers of components in our power projects default on their warranty 
obligations. 
 
In wind projects, we generally use the turnkey EPC model entering into contracts with OEMs for 
manufacturing, installing, and commissioning wind turbines and the balance of plant. Entering third-
party EPC contracts on the basis of fixed price contracts insulate us from adverse price fluctuations for 
the equipment and materials we use for constructing solar and wind projects.  
 
However, we are exposed to construction cost risks that could be caused by various factors, including: 
● increases in the price and availability of land, labour, equipment and materials; 
● inaccuracies of drawings and technical information; 
● delays in the delivery of equipment and materials to project sites; 
● unanticipated increases in equipment, material and land costs; 
● delays caused by local and seasonal weather conditions; and 
● any other unforeseen design and engineering issues, or physical, site and geological 
conditions that result in delays. 
 
If our procurement operations are insufficient, we may experience significant delays or disruption of our 
operations. The construction projects are capital intensive, requires significant time and are subject to 
delays or cost overruns, which could require us to expend additional capital and adversely affect our 
business and operating results. Such potential events include shortages and late delivery of building 
materials and facility equipment, installation, commissioning and qualification of equipment, labour 
disputes, delays or failure in securing the necessary governmental approvals, building sites or land use 
rights, and other changes to plans necessitated by changes in market conditions. Such delays could 
adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 
14. Our Company requires significant amounts of working capital and significant portion of our working 
capital is consumed in trade receivables. Our inability to meet our working capital requirements 
including failure to realize receivables may have an effect on our results of operations and overall 
business.  
 
Our business requires a significant amount of working capital which is based on certain assumptions, 
and therefore, any change of such assumptions would result in changes to our working capital 
requirement. A significant portion of our working capital is consumed in trade receivables . 
 
The trade receivables as at Financial Years ended March 31, 2025, and March 31, 2024, were, ₹ 542.17 
lakhs and ₹ 840.32 lakhs respectively, which constitutes 16.18 % and 21.59 % of our revenue from sale 
of power for such periods respectively, on restated consolidated basis. These include amount receivable 
from State Electricity Boards inclusive of Interest - Tamil Nadu State Electricity Board of ₹ 276.98 lakhs 
28 
and BESCOM ₹ 92.22 lakhs as on March 31, 2025, which had been brought forward from earlier years 
and continuing. Otherwise, the company is receiving dues for bills raised in a particular month by its due 
date which falls in next month.  The actual amount of our future capital requirements may differ from 
estimates as a result of, among other factors, cost overruns, unanticipated. 
  
Expenses, regulatory changes, economic conditions, additional market developments and new 
opportunities in the building materials industry. 
 
In addition, our working capital position is therefore also dependent on the financial position of our 
clients. All of these factors may result in  an increase in the amount of our receivables and short-term 
borrowings. Continued increases in working capital requirements may have an adverse effect on our 
financial condition and results of operations. 
 
15. Majority of the Net Proceeds is proposed to be utilised for setting up 4 MW solar power plant in 
Karnataka State and repayment of loans availed from Corporate Promoters. 
 
The estimated cost for setting up the 4 MW (AC) solar power project is ₹  2,150.00 lakhs, which is 
proposed to be entirely funded from the Net Proceeds of the Issue. 
 
Additionally, the Company proposes to utilise a portion of the Net Proceeds for repayment, in full or in 
part, of certain borrowings availed from the following corporate promoters:  
(i) Loyal Credit & Investments Limited – ₹ 855.00 lakhs; and 
(ii) Indus Finance Limited – ₹ 245.00 lakhs. 
 
The Rights issue committee appointed by the Board of Directors in their meeting held on July 15, 2025 
have reviewed the proposal and approved the acceptance of quotation dated June 09, 2025 received from 
Soleos Solar Energy Private Limited  for 4 MW(AC) equivalent to 5.2 MW (DC) [2.6 MW + 2.6 MW] 
Ground Mount Solar Power Plant within the State of Karnataka. The EPC contractor’s scope includes 
Liasoning for statutory clearances, government liasoning, EPC, comprising of design and engineering, 
supply of all materials, installation, testing, commissioning.  
 
Although, we have finalised the EPC Contractor for the proposed project, however we are yet to complete 
the formalities for engaging the EPC Contractor for execution of the proposed solar project. Further, the 
cost of developing and execution of the propos ed project is based on the quotations received from the 
EPC Contractor and such quotations are subject to change due to various factors such as, variation in 
cost of equipment, change in the government regulation and policies, change in management’s view o f 
desirability of the current plans, possible cost overruns, etc. 
 
For further details, please refer to the chapter titled “Objects of the Issue” on page 64 of this Letter of 
Offer. 
 
16. The extent and reliability of the Indian electricity grid could adversely affect our results of operations 
and financial condition. 
 
The transmission and dispatch of the full output of our wind energy may be curtailed as a result of grid 
constraints, such as grid congestion, restrictions on transmission capacity of the grid and restrictions on 
electricity during certain periods. As the electricity generated by us is not stored and must be transmitted 
or use once generated, we may have to stop producing electricity during the period when electricity is 
unable to be transmitted due to grid congestion or other grid constraints. Such events could reduce the 
net power generation. The curtailment of our windmills output levels will reduce our electricity output 
and limit operational efficiencies, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
and financial condition. 
 
17. There is a time gap between making significant upfront investments in our renewable energy projects 
and receiving revenue which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and 
financial condition. 
 
There is typically a significant time gap —often spanning several months —between when we first 
29 
submit bids in renewable energy auctions for wind or other projects and  when we begin generating 
revenue from the sale of electricity produced by those projects.  Our initial investments include costs 
associated with project analysis and feasibility study, payments for land rights, payments for 
interconnection and grid connectivity arrangements, government permits, engineering , legal, 
accounting, other third -party fees , procurement of solar panels, balance of system costs and other 
payments, which may be non -refundable. Our projects may not be fully monetized given the average 
length of our PPAs but we bear the costs of our initial investment upfront.  
 
Historically, we have funded our project development costs primarily through a combination of our own 
equity contributions and bank financing. However, renewable energy projects typically begin generating 
revenue only once they are fully developed, commercially operational, and connected to the power grid 
under executed power purchase agreements (PPAs). There is often a considerable time lag between 
winning a bid and reaching commercial operations, which can be caused by delays in executing PPAs, 
securing land and interconnection approvals, arranging project financing, completing construction, and 
obtaining required regulatory and grid connectivity clearances. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that a 
successful bid will result in the timely , or eventual  execution of a PPA. Any delays or failures in 
progressing from bid award to operational stage could adversely impact our revenue generation and 
overall financial performance. 
 
There is often a significant period between our initial investment in the development of renewable 
energy projects and their eventual connection to the transmission grid. During this time, projects may 
be affected by unforeseen and adverse events such as u nfavourable environmental or geological 
conditions, labour disruptions, pandemics, shortages in key components like solar panels or wind 
turbines, or extreme weather conditions such as prolonged monsoons. 
 
Additionally, there can be uncertainties related to regulatory approvals , some permits may not be 
secured within expected timelines, while others may lapse, become ineffective, or require re -issuance 
due to regulatory changes or project modifications. These issues can lead to delays in construction or 
defer the scheduled date of commercial operations. 
 
Moreover, any inability to secure project -level financing in line with our expectations could lead to 
postponement or suspension of construction activities. Such delays, whether due to external disruptions, 
regulatory hurdles, or funding challenges could materially and adversely affect our business operations, 
financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 
 
18. Our Company is a party to certain litigation and/or claims. Any adverse decision may make our 
Company liable to liabilities/penalties and may adversely affect our reputation, business, and financial 
status. A classification of these legal and other proceedings is given below.  
 
Our Company including our Subsidiaries are currently involved in legal proceedings in India which are 
pending at different levels of adjudication before the concerned authority. While we do not expect them 
to have any material impact on our business and financial condition, we cannot assure yo u that these 
proceedings will be decided in favour of our Company. Any adverse decision in such proceedings may 
render us liable to penalties and may have a material adverse effect on the financials and reputation of 
our Company, which may in turn have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, during the course 
of our business, we are subject to risk of litigation in relation to contractual obligations, employment and 
labour law related, personal injury, damage to property, etc. 
 
A classification of these outstanding proceedings is given in the following table:

Additionally, we  may be required to devote management and financial resources in the defense or 
prosecution of such legal proceedings. Should any new developments arise, including a change in Indian 
laws or rulings against us by the appellate courts or tribunals, we may face losses and we may have to 
make further  provisions in our financial statements, which could increase our expenses and our 
liabilities. Decisions in such proceedings, adverse to our interests, may have a material adverse effect on 
our business, cash  flows, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to successfully defend 
these or other claims, or if our current provisions prove to be inadequate, our business and results of 
operations could be  adversely affected. Even if we are successful in defending such cases, we will be 
subject to legal and other costs relating to defending such litigation, and such costs could be substantial. 
In addition, we cannot assure you that similar proceedings will not be initiated in the future. Any adverse 
order or direction in these cases by the concerned authorities, even though not quantifiable, may have an 
adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, results of operations and financial condition. For further 
details, please refer to the section " Outstanding Litigation and Material Developments" beginning on 
page 182 of this Letter of Offer. 
 
19. Our windmills business also generates additional profits through the sale of Certified Emission 
Reductions (“CERs”) and participation in renewable energy trading schemes.  
 
A portion of the profitability of our wind energy business is dependent on our ability to monetize Certified 
Emission Reductions (“CERs”) issued under the Clean Development Mechanism (“CDM”) framework, 
as well as to participate in domestic renewable energy trading schemes such as the Renewable Energy 
Certificate (“ REC”) mechanism in India. CERs are tradable credits issued for emission reductions 
achieved by CDM-registered projects, and these credits can be purchased by public or private entities to 
meet their emission reduction obligations under international agreement s or to trade them in carbon 
markets. 
 
However, the ability to generate revenue from CERs depends on multiple factors, including successful 
project registration under the CDM, evolving international climate policies, and demand trends in the 
31 
global carbon credit market. The CDM registration process involves detailed documentation, third-party 
validations, and regulatory approvals, all of which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. 
 
In parallel, our participation in the domestic REC market is subject to regulatory approvals administered 
by agencies such as the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (“ CERC”) and relevant state-level 
authorities. The process for registering a project under the REC mechanism can be complex and time -
intensive, often involving prolonged timelines for application reviews, eligibility verifications, and 
issuance of certificates. Furthermore, there is no assurance that our projects will be successfully registered 
under these schemes or that the RECs generated will be sold at favorable prices, or at all. 
 
Any inability to successfully monetize CERs or RECs due to regulatory delays, market saturation, policy 
changes, or weakening demand could adversely affect our ability to generate supplementary revenue from 
our wind energy portfolio and may, in turn, impact our overall business, financial condition, and results 
of operations. 
 
20. Changes to or withdrawal of government policies, incentives, or support mechanisms for wind energy 
could adversely affect demand for wind-based power and impact our business and financial condition. 
 
The growth of the wind energy sector in India has been significantly supported by government policies 
and incentives, such as tax benefits, generation -based incentives, and preferential tariffs for power 
generated by wind turbine generators (WTGs). However , if such incentives are reduced, withdrawn, or 
shifted in favour of other renewable sources like solar, the competitiveness and financial viability of 
wind energy projects may be impacted. This could lead to reduced investor interest and demand, which 
may adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.  
 
Recently, Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (“TANGEDCO”) issued an 
order proposing to phase out Wind Energy Generators (“ WEGs”) older than 20 years, or alternatively, 
require them to sell power only to TANGEDCO at tariffs determined by the Tamil Nadu Electricity 
Regulatory Commission (“ TNERC”). If implemented, this directive could impact nearly 60% of the 
installed wind capacity in Tamil Nadu. 
 
TANGEDCO has also proposed to discontinue the carryover of banked energy units beyond one month, 
which could significantly affect revenue generation for Independent Power Producers (“ IPPs”), given 
the seasonal nature of wind power. These measures are currently being challenged by the Indian Wind 
Power Association (“ IWPA”) to safeguard the interests of IPPs. However, if these regulatory changes 
are enforced, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, 
and results of operations. 
 
21. Our financial statements for financial year 2025 contain certain audit qualifications. 
 
The audited financial statements for the year ending March 31, 2025, as mentioned in the LOF have 
following audit qualifications: 
 
As of March 31, 2025  
 
Sr. 
No. 
Auditor Qualification Management response  
1. The Holding Company has not recognized 
expected credit loss allowance on interest 
receivables of ₹  248.13 lakhs from TNEB 
Tirunelveli and BESCOM, which are credit 
impaired. This is not in compliance with Ind AS 
109 on Financial Instruments, and results in an 
overstatement of trade receivables and profit for 
the year lower by ₹ 248.13 lakhs 
The Company had provided interest receipts 
from TANGEDCO at the rate of 12% as per 
the power purchase agreement. However, 
TANGEDCO offered 6% simple interest 
which the company agreed to avail on the 
condition that in case interest rate at a higher 
rate paid at a later date by TANGEDCO to 
any claimant, Indowind would become 
entitled to claim differential interest. In the 
case of BESCOM  also the company is 
hopeful of collecting the interest dues in the 
32 
Sr. 
No. 
Auditor Qualification Management response  
due course.  
2. The Company has filed an arbitration claim 
amounting to ₹ 9,083.39 lakhs against Suzlon 
Group. Out of this, ₹ 1,066.24 lakhs paid to 
Suzlon Global Services Limited is accounted as 
advance without adequate audit evidence and not 
expensed. Further, ₹ 845.59 lakhs has been 
recognized as compensation receivable from 
Suzlon Energy Limited without counterparty 
confirmation or fair valuation under Ind AS 109. 
The remaining balance of the claim has not been 
recognized. Had the advance been expensed and 
the receivable a ppropriately fair valued, profit 
before tax would have been lower by ₹ 327.24 
lakhs and ₹ 845.59 lakhs respectively. The 
accounting statement thus departs from the 
relevant Ind AS requirements and materially 
impacts the financial statements.  
In continuation to the MoU dated January 
21, 2022, the company envisaged that the 
12.6 MW expansion project as agreed by 
Suzlon would commence immediately. 
Since there is a delay in the same, the 
Company has initiated arbitration 
proceedings to arrive at a  comprehensive 
solution for the observations made  
3. The Company has recognized ₹ 102 lakhs as 
recoverable from Bank of Baroda based on a 
legal claim pending since 2007 without 
confirmation or sufficient audit evidence, which 
is not in compliance with Ind AS 37 and Ind AS 
109. Had appropriate provision been made, the 
net before tax wou ld have been lower to that 
extent. 
Consequent to the failure of Dena Bank 
(merged with Bank of Baroda), Bhopal to 
honour the Bank Guaranteee (BG) for Rs. 
100 lakhs due on June 20th, 2004, the 
company had filed a petition against the 
bank before the Hon’ble High Court of 
Bombay for enforcing  the BG with interest 
till the date of payment. Since the 
recoverable amount is much higher than the 
BG amount and since the case is under 
progress the company has preferred to retain 
the BG amount in the Non -Current asset as 
it is and consider the interes t amount 
accrued until 31 st March, 2025 under the 
Contingent Asset. The appropriate 
adjustments will be carried out based on the 
outcome of the case  
 
Any such concerns may affect investor perception, lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, or require future 
restatements or adjustments to our financial statements, any of which could adversely affect our 
reputation, business operations, or valuation. 
 
22. Limited access to transmission infrastructure may impact our ability to supply power and adversely 
affect our business. 
 
Like other companies in the industry, we rely on transmission lines owned and operated by government 
or public sector entities to deliver the electricity we generate. Some of our projects currently face limited 
access to transmission and distribution networks, and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain 
access to such infrastructure at reasonable costs, or at all. 
 
In the event of transmission failures or constraints, we may be forced to curtail power generation, leading 
to loss of revenue and underutilization of our project capacity. Such limitations could adversely impact 
our operations, financial condition, and overall business performance. 
 
23. Our funding requirements and the proposed deployment of Net Proceeds have not been appraised by  
any public financial institution or a scheduled commercial bank and our management will have broad 
discretion over utilization of the Net Proceeds, subject to compliance with applicable laws. 
33 
 
Our Company proposes to utilize the Net Proceeds for the following objects:  
 
To setting up of 4 MW solar power plant in Karnataka State. 
 
Additionally, the Company proposes to utilise a portion of the Net Proceeds for repayment, in full or in 
part, of certain borrowings availed from the following corporate promoters:  (i) Loyal Credit & 
Investments Limited and (ii) Indus Finance Limited and General Corporate Purposes  
 
For further details, please refer to chapter titled "Object of the Issue" beginning on page 64 of the Letter

required to operate our businesses on time or at all. Any failure to renew the approvals that have 
expired or apply for and obtain the required approvals, li censes, registrations or permits, or any 
suspension or revocation of any of the approvals, licenses, registrations and permits that have been or 
may be issued to us, may adversely affect our operations.  
 
Our plants in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka are subject to regulatory approvals from both state and central 
governments. Some of these plants are located in areas that require substantial infrastructure support, 
such as roads, electrical power, telecommunicatio ns, water, and waste treatment. We may rely on third 
parties, including local authorities, to secure these approvals and provide the necessary services. Any 
delays or failures by these third parties to deliver the required services, or our inability to obt ain the 
necessary approvals on favorable terms or within the required timelines, could impact our ability to 
operate our plants effectively.  
 
Even after securing the necessary licenses, permits, and approvals, our operations remain subject to 
ongoing regulatory oversight, and such regulations may change without prior notice. Additionally, 
certain contractors and counterparties involved in provid ing services to us are required to obtain and 
maintain their own approvals, licenses, registrations, and permits. We cannot guarantee that these 
contractors or counterparties have obtained or will continue to hold valid approvals, licenses, and permits. 
There is no assurance that we, or any other involved party, will be able to obtain or comply with all 
required licenses, permits, and approvals in a timely manner, which could potentially disrupt the 
construction or operation of our power plants. 
 
Our government approvals and licenses are subject to various conditions, some of which may be onerous. 
We cannot guarantee that these approvals, licenses, registrations, or permits will not be suspended or 
revoked. Failure to comply with applicable regulations, or facing penalties or disruptions in operations, 
could have a material adverse impact on our b usiness and financial results. Additionally, any failure to 
renew expired approvals, or to apply for and obtain required approvals, licenses, registrations, or permits, 
or any suspension or revocation of such approvals, could negatively affect our operations  
 
27. Our Company has not registered the logo and has registered the tradename “Green Power” that we 
use. Our ability to use the logo may be impaired if the same is not registered under our name.  
 
We believe that the use of our name and logo is vital to our competitiveness and success and for us to 
attract and retain our clients and business partners. Any improper use or infringement by any third-party 
could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
Our corporate logo is not registered. Our Company is in the process of enriching its logo and will register 
the logo once it has decided on a new logo. As a result, we may face significant legal and commercial 
risks, including the inability to enforce our rights against third parties who may use identical or 
deceptively similar marks. Without registration, the Company’s legal remedies in the event of 
infringement are limited and may require substantial time and cost to prove common law rights. 
Additionally, a third party may register a similar or identical trademark, which could lead to brand 
dilution, reputational harm, and even loss of exclusive usage rights. This could materially affect the 
Company’s brand value, customer goodwill, and competitive position in the market.  We cannot assure 
35 
you that we will register the current logo or the new logo in future or that, third parties will not infringe 
our intellectual property, causing damage to our business prospects, reputation and goodwill.  
 
Furthermore, we cannot assure you that any application for registration of our corporate logo filed by our 
Company in the future will be granted by the relevant authorities in a timely manner or at all. Our efforts 
to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate and may lead to erosion of our business value 
and our operations could be adversely affected. We may need to litigate in order to determine the validity 
of such claims and the scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation c ould be time 
consuming and costly and the outcome cannot be guaranteed. We may not be able to detect any 
unauthorized use or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce or protect our intellectual property.  
 
28. We do not own our Registered Office.  If we fail to renew lease agreements on favourable terms or in 
a timely manner, or if such agreements are terminated, it could negatively impact our operations and 
business performance. 
 
As on the date of this  Letter of Offer, our Registered Office has been taken on lease by our Company 
from Bekae Properties Private Limited, details of the same have been provided below:

There is no assurance that our Company will be able to renew the lease deed entered into with third 
parties in a timely manner or at all. The lease agreements for these premises are subject to termination, 
and such events could force us to relocate or close some of our branches. Although we have not faced 
significant issues with lease renewals in the past, and no leases have been terminated outside of normal 
business procedures, failure to renew these agreements, or obtaining unfavourable renewal terms, could 
disrupt our operations and increase costs, thereby impacting our business performance.  
 
29. Our operating windmills are only located in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka and we are heavily dependent 
upon the environmental changes, economical conditions and government policies of these two states.  
 
Our operations have been geographically concentrated in the states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka due to 
the potential for wind power availability, favourable incentives for renewable energy companies, 
attractive tariff structures and a shortage of electricity supply.

This concentration of business subjects us to various risks, including but not limited to:  
• weather condition in these states; 
• seasonal variations in the demand of electricity in the states; 
• vulnerability to change in laws, policies and regulations of the political and economic 
environment; 
• perception by our potential customers that we are a regional power generation company 
which hampers us from competing for large and complex projects at the national level; and  
• limitation on our ability to implement the strategy to our operations in the states where we 
intend to conduct business. 
 
Our business is heavily reliant on the overall economic conditions and activity in the states where we 
operate, as well as on government policies at the central, state, and local levels regarding renewable 
energy. While investment in renewable energy has been promoted in these regions, there is no guarantee 
that this trend will persist. 
 
30. We are under contractual obligation to transfer certain of our freely held land parcels to certain  
Promoter Group entities of our Company. 
 
Our windmills are located on freehold land across Tamil Nadu and Karnataka admeasuring to  643.59 
acres. We are under contractual obligation to transfer 189.84 acres of the land out of the 643.59 acres  
aforementioned land to certain Promoter Group entities of our Company. The transfer is yet to be  
completed. 
 
When our Company decides to transfer the aforementioned land or when the Promoter Group entities 
enforce our Company to transfer the aforementioned land, we may incur substantial stamp duty,  
registration and other charges which may be incidental to the transfer, and it may have impact on the  
financial performance of the Company.  
 
31. Risks inherent to power sector could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition 
and results of operations. 
 
Power sector have certain risks which are generally beyond our control and include; (i) political,  
regulatory, fiscal, monetary and legal actions and policies that may adversely affect the viability of power 
projects, and have an adverse effect on our future projects; (ii) adverse changes in demand for, or the  
price of, power generated or distributed; (iii) failure of third parties such as contractors, O&M 
contractors, sub-contractors and others to perform on their contractual obligations in respect of projects  
we are engaged on; (iv)  economic, political  and social instability  (such as creation of  new state 
boundaries in India) or occurrences such as natural disasters, armed conflict and terrorist attacks,  
particularly where projects are located or in the markets they are intended to serve; and (v) delay in  
obtaining/renewing regulatory or environmental clearances and suspension or cancellation due to non - 
conformity with conditions stipulated under the clearance. In addition, any significant change in plans of 
our clients or change in our relationship with these existing clients may affect our business prospects.   
 
Furthermore, we are dependent on our client’s financial condition, as any adverse change in their  
financial condition may affect the financing and consequently the implementation of the projects. In the 
event our clients are adversely affected, our results of operations and financial condition could be  
materially and adversely affected. 
 
32. We are subject to credit and performance risk from our suppliers and contractors. If our suppliers and 
contractors fail to perform as required under our agreements with them our business, results of 
operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. 
 
We enter into contracts with third-party suppliers for equipment, materials, and other goods and services 
required for the development, construction, and operation of our projects, as well as for other business 
operations. While we maintain a diverse range of vendors, there remains a risk that some may fail to meet 
their obligations. Although we have not experienced instances of vendor non-performance during Fiscal 
2025 and 2024 any future failure by our vendors to meet their obligations, or the delivery of defective 
37 
components or non-compliant goods, could result in a material breach of the relevant supply agreements. 
 
Contractors and suppliers involved in our projects are generally subject to liquidated damages for delays 
or performance issues. Our operation and maintenance ("O&M") contractors may fail to plan for the entire 
lifecycle of a project, potentially leading to issues such as an inability to service wind turbines or solar 
modules, failure to maintain site infrastructure, or insufficient resources at project sites. There exists a 
dispute with Suzlon Global Services Limited in connection with O&M maintenance for our 18 MW wind 
turbines located in Chitradurga district, Karnataka, which is currently under arbitration. Any future failure 
by our O&M contractors to meet their obligations could result in decreased project performance, a shorter 
operational lifespan, or shutdowns, all of which could negatively impact our operations, financial 
performance, and results. Liquidated damages under third-party EPC and O&M contracts are typically 
capped at a specific amount or a percentage of the contract price or annual fees. As such, the liquidated 
damages recovered from defaulting vendors may not fully compensate for the losses we incur. 
 
While we may be able to make a claim under applicable warranties to recover some or all of the expenses 
or losses arising from defective products, such claims may not fully cover the costs incurred. Additionally, 
if our suppliers cease operations or fail to honour their warranties, we will be responsible for covering the 
expenses and losses related to the defects. If our third -party service providers are unable to fulfill their 
obligations—whether due to bankruptcy, liquidation, or legal restrictions—we may face additional costs 
and delays in finding replacement providers, which could significantly impact our ability to meet our 
obligations. 
 
33. Our Promoter Group Entities are engaged in the same line of business that may lead to real or  
potential conflicts of interest with our business which in turn may materially adversely impact our  
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
Our Promoter Group Entities in which our Promoters have significant influence are engaged in the same 
line of business and thus may potentially compete with us. Interests of such persons may conflict with  
the interests of our Company, and they may, for business considerations or otherwise, cause us to take  
actions, or refrain from taking actions, in order to benefit themselves, which may conflict with the best  
interests of our Company or that of our other Shareholders, which in turn may materially adversely  
impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
34. We cannot assure you that our proposed Issue will be fully subscribed.  
 
While our Company expects that the proposed Issue will be fully subscribed, there can be no assurance 
that this will occur. However, our Issue is Underwritten to the extent of ₹2000.10 Lakhs. In the Fiscal 
2023, our Company undertook a rights issue of ₹  4,300.00 lakhs for the repayment of dues to EXIM 
Bank. However, the said rights issue was only partially subscribed, with ₹ 2,111 lakhs being subscribed. 
 
In the present Issue, the current utilisation plan involves the set -up of the Solar Power project, which is 
expected to start contributing to revenue generation from the current financial year itself. 
 
However, in the event that this Issue is not fully subscribed despite these mitigating factors, our Company 
may be required to revise or reallocate the utilisation of proceeds, which could result in delays in the set-
up of the Solar Power  Project. This may, in turn, adversely impact our expected revenues, business 
operations, and financial condition. 
 
35. We have relied upon the certificate from the Internal Auditor made available to us with respect to the 
land title documents i.e., which are predominantly in Tamil and due to the impracticality of translating 
them as they are voluminous in nature. 
 
The land title documents pertaining to the land owned by our Company is predominantly available in 
Tamil language and are voluminous in nature and due to this it is impractical to translate each of those 
documents. Accordingly, reliance has been placed by us upon the Internal Auditor Certificate dated July 
02, 2025 made available with respect to the land title documents to verify land  related details, such as 
area, location, ownership, etc. which are mentioned in this Letter of Offer. 
 
38 
36. Our operations are subject to various operational risks that could expose us to material liabilities, loss 
in revenues and increase in expenses. We may also be subject to liability claims arising from defects  
in the services provided by us. 
 
Our operations involve inherent risks associated with the use of large -scale equipment and construction 
activities, including equipment failure, workplace accidents, injury or loss of life, damage to property, 
and potential environmental harm. Many of our project sites involve close interaction between personnel 
and heavy machinery, vehicles, elevated platforms, and regulated materials. Our Company is responsible 
for enforcing safety measures across these sites; however, any failure to implement effective procedures 
may result in injury, increased employee turnover, project delays, higher costs, and reputational harm.  
 
While our Company maintains insurance coverage, it is currently limited to a 20 MW windmill farm. 
There is no assurance that this coverage will be adequate to cover all potential  liabilities arising from 
accidents, equipment breakdown, or other operational risks across all our sites. Any uninsured or 
underinsured losses could have a significant adverse effect on our business operations, financial 
condition, and results of operations. 
 
37. We operate in highly competitive markets and our business,  results of operation and financial  
condition will depend on how effectively we compete. 
 
The power sector is rapidly evolving and is highly competitive. Some of our competitors may have  
significantly greater financial resources and market reach as compared to us. While we have historically 
been able to conduct our business at competitive margins and on a cost -effective basis, there can be no  
assurance that we will be able to do so in the future. We believe that our ability to compete also depends 
on a number of factors beyond our control, including the ability of our competitors to attract, train,  
motivate and retain highly skilled technical employees, the price at which our competitors offer 
comparable services. 
 
38. Any failure by us to adapt to industry trends and evolving technologies in the renewable energy sector 
to meet our customers’ demands may materially adversely affect our business and results of 
operations. 
 
The renewable energy sector is dynamic and rapidly evolving, driven by technological innovation, 
changing regulatory landscapes, and shifting consumer and investor expectations. Failure to adapt to 
emerging trends and evolving technologies may render our existing offerings less competitive or obsolete. 
For instance, the global push towards decarbonisation is accelerating demand for next -generation clean 
energy solutions such as green hydrogen, energy storage systems, and carbon capture technologies. 
 
Any perception —whether arising from scientific studies, policy shifts, or market sentiment —that a 
particular renewable energy source we depend on is less effective in meeting climate goals may reduce its 
attractiveness, leading to diminished demand and adv ersely affecting our market position. Additionally, 
ongoing advancements in adjacent sectors —such as electric vehicle (EV) battery technologies —could 
reduce reliance on other energy carriers like hydrogen, thereby altering long -term demand projections. 
Regulatory changes, including modifications to subsidies, tax benefits, or renewable energy obligations, 
may also redirect incentives toward alternate energy technologies. 
 
Our ability to maintain relevance will depend on timely investments in research and development, 
continuous innovation, and responsiveness to customer needs and industry benchmarks. Any delays or 
shortcomings in identifying and implementing such changes may result in loss of business opportunities, 
reputational harm, and adverse impacts on our operational and financial performance. 
 
39. We have certain contingent liabilities and assets, which, if materialize, may adversely affect our results 
of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 
The table below set forth our Contingent Liabilities as on Quarter ended June 30, 2025, March 31, 2025

Notes: These terms shall carry the meaning as per Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013 (as amended)  
 
There can be no assurance  that we will not incur similar or increased levels of contingent liabilities in 
the current Financial Year or in the future and that our existing contingent liabilities will not have material 
adverse effect on our  business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of these contingent 
liabilities materialize, our profitability may be adversely affected. For further details in relation to our 
contingent liabilities,  please refer to the  section entitled " Financial Statements" on page  112 of the 
Letter of Offer. 
 
40. Changes in technology may render our current technologies obsolete or require us to make substantial 
capital investments. Failure to respond to current and future technological changes in an effective and 
timely manner may adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 
As part of our business, we leverage technology to improve efficiency, plant availability and output. 
However, the technology required for renewable energy power projects are subject to continuous change 
and development. Some of our existing technologies and processes in the renewable energy business may 
become obsolete or perform less efficiently compared to newer and better technologies and processes. The 
cost of upgrading or implementing new technologies, upgrading our existing equipment or expanding 
capacity could be significant and may adversely affect our results of operations if we are unable to pass 
on such costs to our customers or recover such costs from revenue. Failure to respond to current and future 
technological changes in an effective and tim ely manner may adversely affect our business, results of 
operations and financial condition. 
 
41. The success of our business relies on the expertise of our employees including key managerial 
personnel, and senior management, as well as our ability to attract, train, and retain skilled employees. 
 
We operate in an industry where the quality of our people is a critical asset. We benefit significantly 
from the vision, strategic guidance, experience and skills of several key members of our management 
40 
team, which includes our Promoters, supported by the skills, efforts, expertise, continued performance 
and motivation of our Key Management Personnel, and other personnel. If any of our Promoters, Key  
Management Personnel cease  to be associated with our Company and we fail to  recruit suitable 
replacements in a timely manner, our ability to manage our growth and our business, results of operations 
and prospects may be adversely affected.  
 
The success of our business operations is largely driven by the expertise of our employees. We believe 
their experience has been key to our consistent growth, profitability, and strong liquidity and capital 
position. Our ability to sustain this growth depe nds on attracting and retaining top talent, developing 
managerial skills to address emerging business challenges, and maintaining high customer service 
standards.  
 
If we fail to attract or retain skilled employees, our ability to expand could be hindered, and revenue may 
decline. We would need to recruit and train new hires while also ensuring existing employees adhere to 
internal controls and risk management procedures. Failure to properly train and motivate our workforce 
could lead to higher attrition, reduced customer service quality, and increased hiring costs, potentially 
diverting management resources and increasing exposure to high-risk credit.  
 
The loss of key management or failure to retain talented personnel could have a negative impact on our 
business and future financial performance. Any strike, agitation, or labour unrest involving our 
employees could disrupt our operations and negatively af fect our business. Such actions may lead to 
decreased productivity, delays in services, and increased costs related to resolving labo ur disputes. If 
prolonged, they could also harm our reputation, employee morale, and relationships with customers. 
Additionally, labour disruptions could affect our ability to meet operational targets, attract and retain 
key talent, and impact our financial performance. While we strive to maintain a positive work 
environment and address employee concerns proactively, there can be no assurance that we will be able 
to prevent or quickly resolve any such disputes. 
 
42. The construction and operation of wind energy projects has faced opposition from local communities 
and other parties in the past and there can be no assurance that the Company will not encounter  
similar opposition in the future. 
 
Our Company has previously encountered resistance and protests from local communities in areas where 
our windmills are installed. Such opposition may arise due to concerns relating to land acquisition, 
environmental impact, disruption to local livelihoods, or other socio-economic factors. 
 
While we strive to engage with stakeholders and address their concerns through appropriate measures, 
we cannot assure you that similar challenges will not occur in the future. Any opposition, protest, or 
litigation by local communities, environmental groups, or other affected parties could result in delays in 
project execution, additional compliance costs, or even cancellation of certain projects.  
 
Such developments may adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, cash flows, and 
overall results of operations. 
 
43. We have in the past entered into related party transactions and may continue to do so in the future. 
 
We enter into various transactions with related parties in the ordinary course of business. These 
transactions principally include key management personnel compensation, power share income and 
investments in subsidiaries.  
 
While all such transactions have been conducted on an arm’s length basis, and in accordance with 
applicable laws, we cannot assure you that we could not have achieved more favorable terms had such 
transactions been entered into with unrelated parties. Further, it is likely that we may enter into additional 
related party transactions in the future subject to compliance with the applicable law. Such related party 
transactions in the future or any other future transactions may potentially involve conflicts of interest 
which may be detrimental to the interest of our Company and we cannot assure you that such transactions, 
individually or in the aggregate, will always be in the best interests of our minority shareholders and will 
not have an adverse effect on our  business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and 
41 
prospects. 
 
 
Although all material related party transactions that we may enter into, will be subject to Audit 
Committee and Board or shareholder approval, as necessary under the Companies Act 2013 and the SEBI 
Listing Regulations, there can be no assurance that such t ransactions, individually or in aggregate, will 
not have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. For further details, see the 
section “Financial Information”, beginning on page 112 of the Letter of Offer. 
 
44. Our inability to procure and/or maintain adequate insurance cover in connection with our business  
may adversely affect our operations and profitability.  
 
Our operations may be subject to risks such as fire, accidents, and natural disasters , which may not be 
fully compensated by insurance. If any or all of our equipment is damaged in whole or in part, or if there 
is a loss of life of our employees, our operations may get interrupted, totally or partially, for a temporary 
period. 
 
There can be no assurance that the terms of our insurance policies will be adequate to cover any damage 
or loss suffered by our Company or that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms 
or will be available in sufficient amounts to co ver one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not 
disclaim coverage as to any future claim 
 
45. Our ability to pay dividends in the future will depend upon future earnings, financial condition, cash 
flows, working capital requirements and capital expenditures and financial condition.  
 
The amount of our future dividend payments, if any, will depend on various factors such as our future earnings, 
cash flows, financial condition, working capital requirements, capital expenditures and in accordance with 
applicable laws. We may decide to retain all of our earnings to finance the development and expansion of our 
businesses and, therefore, may not declare dividends on the Equity Shares.  
 
Additionally, in the future, we may be restricted by the terms of our financing agreements in making dividend 
payments unless otherwise agreed with our lenders. The amounts paid as dividends in the past are not 
necessarily indicative of our company’s dividend decisions in future or the dividend amounts, if any, in the 
future. There is no guarantee that any dividends will be declared or paid or that the amount thereof will not be 
decreased in the future.  
 
46. Maintenance and expansion of our power generation facilities are provided by third -parties and 
involve significant risks that could result in reduced power generation and financial results . 
 
Our power generation facilities require regular maintenance for which we may engage third -party 
operations and maintenance contractors. Although we have services contracts with third-parties, we are 
exposed to risks regarding the quality and timeliness of their services. Any unexpected operational or 
mechanical failure, including failure associated with breakdowns and any decreased operational or 
management performance, could reduce our facilities generating capacity below expected levels and 
reduce our revenues as a result of generating and selling less power. Degradation of the performance of 
our projects beyond levels provided for in the related PPAs may also reduce our revenues. Our plants 
may be adversely affected by storms, high winds or flooding resulting in damage and loss of revenue. 
Unanticipated capital expenditures associated with maintaining or repairing our facilities may also 
reduce profitability, especially because our tariff is fixed in the PPAs, and we may not be able to pass 
through any unexpected costs in relation to the projects to our customers. Furthermore, we are not able 
to mitigate such project risks through appropriate insurance for natural calamities and through 
performance guarantees by our operations and maintenance contractors. Any uncovered risk may result 
in reduced power generation and will have adverse impact on financial results. This impact we may not 
be able to recover through insurance. If the situation worsens, there could be a further adverse impact 
on our revenues. 
 
47. Failure or disruption of our IT systems may adversely affect our business, results of operations 
and financial condition. 
42 
 
We rely on IT systems in connection with financial controls, risk management and transaction 
processing as well as to manage our power projects. We may be subject to disruptions of our IT systems, 
arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our  control (for example, damage or 
incapacitation by human error, natural disasters, electrical or telecommunication outages, sabotage, 
computer viruses, or loss of support services from third parties such as internet backbone providers). 
Although we have no t experienced material incidents in the past, we may in the future experience 
incidents of system failures, cyber -attacks and frauds, hacking, phishing, trojans and theft of data or 
other types of cyber security attacks or incidents that have a material ad verse effect on our business, 
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In the event we experience systems 
interruptions, errors, downtime, incidents of hacking, phishing, or breaches of our data security systems, 
this may give rise to det erioration in customer service and loss or liability to us and it may materially 
and adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
Such cyber security events could expose us to a risk of loss or misus e of our information, litigation, 
reputational damage, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, fines, penalties or losses that are 
either not insured against or not fully covered by insurance maintained. We may be required to expend 
significant ad ditional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate 
vulnerabilities. 
 
48. Our employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance 
with regulatory standards and requirements. 
 
We are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could 
include losses of components, equipment and materials and intentional failures to comply with any 
regulations applicable to us, to provide accurate information to regulatory authorities, to comply with 
manufacturing standards we have established, or to report financial information or data accurately or 
disclose unauthorized activities to us. We have had no material incidents of employee misconduct during 
Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024. 
 
There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and deter such misconduct, and the precautions 
we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged 
risk. If our employees engage in any such future misconduct, we could face criminal penalties, fines, 
revocation of regulatory approvals and harm to our reputation, any of which could form a material 
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
49. If we are unable to establish and maintain an effective internal controls and compliance system, our 
business and reputation could be adversely affected. 
 
We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal measures commensurate with the 
size and complexity of operations. Our internal audit functions make an evaluation of the adequacy and 
effectiveness of internal systems on an ongoing basi s so that our operations adhere to our policies, 
compliance requirements and internal guidelines. We periodically test and update our internal processes 
and systems and there have been no past material instances of failure to maintain effective internal 
controls and compliance system. However, we could be exposed to operational risks arising from any 
potential inadequacy or failure of internal processes or systems, and our actions may not be sufficient to 
ensure effective internal checks and balances in all circumstances. 
 
We take reasonable steps to maintain appropriate procedures for compliance and disclosure and to 
maintain effective internal controls over our financial reporting so that we produce reliable financial 
reports and prevent financial fraud. As risks evolve an d develop, internal controls must be reviewed on 
an ongoing basis. Maintaining such internal controls requires human diligence and compliance and is 
therefore subject to lapses in judgment and failures that result from human error.  
 
Further, our operations are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations. These laws generally prohibit 
us and our employees and intermediaries from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments 
to government officials or other persons to ob tain or retain business or gain some other business 
advantage. We participate in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose actions could 
potentially subject us to liability under these laws or other local anti -corruption laws. While our code of 
43 
conduct requires our employees and intermediaries to comply with all applicable laws, and we continue 
to enhance our policies and procedures in an effort to ensure compliance with applicable anti-corruption 
laws and regulations, these measures may not prev ent the breach of such anti -corruption laws, as there 
are risks of such breaches in emerging markets, such as India. If we are not in compliance with applicable 
anti-corruption laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions 
and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results 
of operations and financial condition. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of anti -
corruption laws by the relevant authori ties could also have an adverse impact on our business and 
reputation. 
 
ISSUE SPECIFIC RISKS 
 
50. There is no public market for the Rights Equity Shares or Equity Shares outside India. 
 
After this Issue, there will continue to be no public market for our Equity Shares in the United States or 
any country other than India. In addition, the holders of the partly paid-up Rights Equity Shares will not 
be able to trade in these shares until the y are credited to the holders’ account as fully paid -up, and 
thereafter there will also be no public market for the Rights Equity Shares outside of India. We cannot 
assure you that the face value of the Rights Equity Shares will correspond to the price at which the Rights 
Equity Shares will trade subsequent to this Issue. This may also affect the liquidity of our Rights Equity 
Shares and Equity Shares and restrict your ability to sell them. 
 
51. Investors will be subject to market risks until the Equity Shares credited to the investors demat account 
are listed and permitted to trade. 
 
Investors can start trading the Equity Shares allotted to them only after they have been credited to an 
investor’s demat account, are listed and permitted to trade. Since the Equity Shares are currently traded 
on the Stock Exchanges, investors will be subj ect to market risk from the date they pay for the Equity 
Shares to the date when trading approval is granted for the same. Further, there can be no assurance that 
the Equity Shares allocated to an investor will be credited to the investor’s demat account or that trading 
in the Equity Shares will commence in a timely manner. 
 
52. No market for the Right E ntitlements may develop and the price of the Right Entitlements may be 
volatile. 
 
No assurance can be given that an active trading market for the Rights Entitlements will develop on the 
Stock Exchanges during the Renunciation Period or that there will be sufficient liquidity in Rights 
Entitlements trading during this period. The trading  price of the Rights Entitlements will not only 
depend on supply and demand for the Rights Entitlements, which may be affected by factors unrelated 
to the trading in the Equity Shares, but also on the quoted price of the Equity Shares, amongst others. 
Factors affecting the volatility of the price of the Equity Shares, as described herein, may magnify the 
volatility of the trading price of the Rights Entitlements, and a decline in the price of the Equity Shares 
will have an adverse impact on the trading pric e of the Rights Entitlements. Since the trading of the 
Rights Equity Shares will be on a separate segment compared to the Equity Shares on the floor of the 
Stock Exchanges, the trading of Rights Equity Shares may not track the trading of Equity Shares. The  
trading price of the Rights Entitlements may be subject to greater price fluctuations than that of the 
Equity Shares. 
 
53. The Rights Entitlement of Eligible Equity Shareholders holding Equity Shares in physical form may 
lapse in case they fail to furnish the details of their demat account to the Registrar  
 
In accordance with Regulation 77A of the SEBI ICDR Regulations read with the SEBI ICDR Master 
Circular, the credit of Rights Entitlements and Allotment of Rights Equity Shares shall be made in 
dematerialized form only. Prior to the Issue Opening Date, our Company shall credit the Rights 
Entitlements to the demat accounts of the Eligible Equity Shareholders holding the Equity Shares in 
dematerialised form 
 
Our Company has opened a separate demat escrow account (namely, “INDOWIND ENERGY LIMITED 
44 
- Right Issue Escrow Entitlement Demat Account”) (“ Demat Escrow Account”) and would credit 
Rights Entitlements on the basis of the Equity Shares: (a) held by Eligible Equity Shareholders which 
are held in physical form as on Record Date; or (b) which are held in the account of the Investor 
Education and Protection Fund (“ IEPF”) authority; or (c) of the Eligible Equity Shareholder whose 
demat accounts are frozen or where the Equity Shares are lying in the unclaimed/suspense escrow 
account/demat suspense acco unt (including those pursuant to Regulation 39 of the SEBI LODR 
Regulations) or details of which are unavailable with our Company or with the Registrar on the Record 
Date or where Equity Shares have been kept in abeyance or where entitlement certificate has been issued 
or where instruction has been issued for stopping issue or transfer or where letter of confirmation lying 
in escrow account; or (d) where credit of the Rights Entitlements have returned/reversed/failed for any 
reason; or (e) where ownership is currently under dispute, including any court or regulatory proceedings 
or where legal notices have been issued, if any or (f) such other cases where our Company is unable to 
credit Rights Entitlements for any other reasons. 
 
Our Company shall credit the Rights Entitlements to the Demat  Escrow Account on the basis of 
information available with our Company and to serve the interest of relevant Eligible Equity 
Shareholders to provide them with a reasonable opportunity to participate in the Issue. The credit of the 
Rights Entitlements to the Demat Escrow Account by our Company does not create any right in favour 
of the relevant Eligible Equity Shareholders for transfer of Rights Entitlement to their demat account or 
to receive any Equity Shares in the Issue. 
 
54. Overseas shareholders may not be able to participate in the Company’s future rights offerings or 
certain other equity issues. 
 
If our Company offers or causes to be offered to holders of its Equity Shares rights to subscribe for 
additional Equity Shares or any right of any other nature, our Company will have discretion as to the 
procedure to be followed in making such rights avail able to overseas holders of the Equity Shares or in 
disposing of such rights for the benefit of such holders. For instance, our Company may not offer such 
rights to the holders of Equity Shares who have a registered address in the United States unless: (i)  a 
registration statement is in effect, if a registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act is required in 
order for the Company to offer such rights to holders and sell the securities represented by such rights; 
or (ii) the offering and sale of such  rights or the underlying securities to such holders are exempt from  
registration under the provisions of the U.S. Securities Act. Our Company has no obligation to prepare 
or file any registration statement. Accordingly, shareholders who have a registered address in the United 
States may be unable to participate in future rights offerings and may experience a dilution in their 
holdings as a result. 
 
55. Applicants to this Issue are not allowed to withdraw their Applications after the Issue Closing Date.  
 
In terms of the SEBI ICDR Regulations, Applicants in this Issue are not allowed to withdraw their 
Applications after the Issue Closing Date. The Allotment in this Issue and the credit of such Equity 
Shares to the Applicant’s demat account with its deposito ry participant shall be completed within such 
period as prescribed under the applicable laws. There is no assurance, however, that material adverse 
changes in the international or national monetary, financial, political or economic conditions or other 
events in the nature of force majeure, material adverse changes in our business, results of operation, cash 
flows or financial condition, or other events affecting the Applicant’s decision to invest in the Equity 
Shares, would not arise between the Issue Closi ng Date and the date of Allotment in this Issue. 
Occurrence of any such events after the Issue Closing Date could also impact the market price of our 
Equity Shares. The Applicants shall not have the right to withdraw their applications in the event of any 
such occurrence. We cannot assure you that the market price of the Equity Shares will not decline below 
the Issue Price. To the extent the market price for the Equity Shares declines below the Issue Price after 
the Issue Closing Date, the shareholder will be required to purchase Equity Shares at a price that will be 
higher than the actual market price for the Equity Shares at that time. Should that occur, the shareholder 
will suffer an immediate unrealized loss as a result. We may complete the Allotment even if such events 
may limit the Applicants’ ability to sell our Equity Shares after this Issue or cause the trading price of 
our Equity Shares to decline. 
 
 
45 
 
 
 
56. Failure to exercise or sell the Rights Entitlements will  cause the Rights Entitlements to lapse without  
compensation and result in a dilution of shareholding. 
 
Rights Entitlements that are not exercised prior to the end of the Issue Closing Date will expire and 
become null and void, and Eligible Equity Shareholders will not receive any consideration for them. The 
proportionate ownership and voting interest in our  Company of Eligible Equity Shareholders who fail 
(or are not able) to exercise their Rights Entitlements will be diluted. Even if you elect to sell your 
unexercised Rights Entitlements, the consideration you receive for them may not be sufficient to fully  
compensate you for the dilution of your percentage ownership of the equity share capital of our Company 
that may be caused as a result of the Issue. Renouncees may not be able to apply in case of failure in 
completion of renunciation through off-market transfer in such a manner that the Rights Entitlements are 
credited to the demat account of the Renouncees prior to the Issue Closing Date. Further, in case, the 
Rights Entitlements do not get credited in time, in case of On Market Renunciation, such Renouncee will 
not be able to apply in this Issue with respect to such Rights Entitlements. For details, please refer to 
"Terms of the Issue" beginning on page 196 of this Letter of Offer. 
 
57. Any future issuance of Equity Shares, or convertible securities or other equity-linked securities by our 
Company may dilute your shareholding and any sale of Equity Shares by our Promoter or members 
of our Promoter Group may adversely affect the trading price of the Equity Shares.  
 
Any future issuance of the Equity Shares, convertible securities or securities linked to the Equity Shares 
by our Company through an issue of our securities. In addition, any perception by investors that such 
issuances or sales might occur could also affect the trading price of the Equity Shares. We cannot assure 
you that we will not issue additional Equity Shares. The disposal of Equity Shares by any of our Promoter 
and Promoter Group, or the perception that such sales may occur may significantly affect th e trading 
price of the Equity Shares. We cannot assure you that our Promoter and Promoter Group will not dispose 
of, pledge or encumber their Equity Shares in the future. 
 
58. You may not receive the Equity Shares that you subscribe in the Issue until fifteen days after the date 
on which this Issue closes, which will subject you to market risk. 
 
The Equity Shares that you subscribe in the Issue may not be credited to your demat account with the 
depository participants until approximately 15 days from the Issue Closing Date. You can start trading 
such Equity Shares only after receipt of the listing  and trading approval in respect thereof. There can be 
no assurance that the Equity Shares allocated to you will be credited to your demat account, or that 
trading in the Equity Shares will commence within the specified time period, subjecting you to marke t 
risk for such period. 
 
59. There is no guarantee that our  Equity Shares will be listed in a timely manner or at all which may  
adversely affect the trading price of our Equity Shares. 
 
In accordance with Indian law and practice, final approval for listing and trading of the Equity Shares 
will not be granted by the Stock Exchanges until after those Equity Shares have been issued and allotted. 
Approval will require all relevant documents a uthorizing the issuing of Equity Shares to be submitted. 
There could be a failure or delay in listing the Equity Shares on Stock Exchanges. Any failure or delay 
in obtaining the approval would restrict your ability to dispose of your Equity Shares. Further, historical 
trading prices, therefore, may not be indicative of the prices at which the Equity Shares will trade in the 
future which may adversely impact the ability of our shareholders to sell the Equity Shares or the price 
at which shareholders may be able to sell their Equity Shares at that point of time. 
 
60. Holders of Equity Shares in foreign jurisdictions could be restricted in their ability to exercise their 
entitlement to shares of an Indian company and could thereby suffer future dilution of their ownership 
position. 
 
Under the Companies Act, a company incorporated in India must first offer its shares to the holders of 
46 
its equity shares to subscribe and pay for a proportionate number of shares to maintain their existing 
ownership percentages, unless this entitlement has been waived by the holders of equity shares by 
adoption of a special resolution. If the law of the foreign jurisdiction that you are in does not permit the 
exercise of such entitlement, without us filing an offering document or registration statement with the 
applicable authority in such jurisdiction, you will be unable to subscribe to the shares of our Company, 
unless we make such a filing. We may elect not to file a registration statement in relation to such shares. 
To the extent that you are unable to exercise the entitlement granted in respect of the Equity Shares, 
your proportional interests in us would be reduced. 
 
61. Fluctuation in the exchange rate between the Indian Rupee and foreign currencies may adversely 
affect the value of our Equity Shares, independent of our operating results.  
 
On listing, our Equity Shares will be quoted in Indian Rupees on the Stock Exchanges. Any dividends in 
respect of our Equity Shares will also be paid in Indian Rupees and subsequently converted into the 
relevant foreign currency for repatriation, if required. Any adverse movement in currency exchange rates 
during the time that it takes to undertake such conversion may reduce the net dividend to foreign investors 
In addition, any adverse movement in currency exchange rates during a delay in repatriating outside India 
the proceeds from a sale of Equity Shares, for example, because of a delay in regulatory approvals that 
may be required for the sale of Equity Shares may reduce the proceeds received by equity shareholders 
For example, the exchange rate between t he Rupee and the U.S. dollar has fluctuated substantially in 
recent years and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future, which may adversely affect the 
trading price of our Equity Shares and returns on our Equity Shares, independent of our operating results. 
 
62. Our Company will not distribute this  Letter of Offer, Letter of Offer, the Rights Entitlement Letter, 
the Application Form and other Issue related materials to certain categories of overseas Equity 
Shareholders. 
 
We will not distribute th e Draft Letter of Offer,  this Letter of Offer, the Abridged Letter of Offer, the 
Application Form and the Rights Entitlement  Letter (together, the “ Issue Materials ”) to overseas 
Shareholders who have not provided an address in India for service of documents. The Issue Materials 
will be sent/ dispatched only to the Eligible Equity Shareholders who have provided an Indian address. 
In case such Eligible Equity Shareholders have provided their valid e-mail address, the Application Form, 
the Rights Entitlement Letter and other Issue Materials will be sent only to their valid e -mail address. 
Further, this Letter of Offer will be sent/ dispatched only to overseas Shareholders who qualify as the 
Eligible Equity Shareholders who have provided an Indian address and who have made a request in this 
regard. In the event that e-mail addresses of the Eligible Equity Shareholders are not available with us or 
the Eligible Shareholders have not provided valid e-mail addresses to us, we will dispatch the Application 
Form and other applicable Issue materials by way of physical delivery as per the applicable laws to those 
Eligible Equity Shareholders who have provided their Indian address. The Issue Materials will not be 
distributed to addresses outside India on account of restrictions that apply to circulation of such materials 
in overseas jurisdictions. Investors can also access th e Draft Letter of Offer, this Letter of Offer and the 
Application Form from the websites of the Registrar, our Company, the Le ad Manager and the Stock 
Exchanges. 
 
However, the Companies Act requires companies to serve documents at any address, which may be 
provided by the members as well as through e -mail. Presently, there is lack of clarity under the 
Companies Act and the rules made thereunder with respect to distr ibution of the Issue materials in 
overseas jurisdictions where such distribution may be prohibited under the applicable laws of such 
jurisdictions. However, we cannot assure you that the regulator or authorities would not adopt a different 
view with respect to compliance with the Companies Act and may subject us to fines or penalties. 
 
63. Sale of Equity Shares by our Promoter or other  significant shareholder(s) may adversely affect the  
trading price of the Equity Shares. 
 
Any instance of disinvestments of equity shares by our Promoter or by other significant shareholder(s)  
may significantly affect the trading price of our Equity Shares. Further, our market price may also be  
adversely affected even if there is a perception or belief that such sales of Equity Shares might occur. 
 
47 
 
 
64. Rights of shareholders under Indian laws may be more limited than under the laws of other 
jurisdictions. 
 
Indian legal principles related to corporate procedures, directors’ fiduciary duties and liabilities, and 
shareholders’ rights may differ from those that would apply to a company in another jurisdiction. 
Shareholders’ rights including in relation to class actions, under Indian law may not be as extensive as 
shareholders’ rights under the laws of other countries or jurisdictions. Investors may have more difficulty 
in asserting their rights as shareholder in an Indian company than as shareholder of a corporat ion in 
another jurisdiction. 
 
EXTERNAL RISK FACTOR 
 
65. There are significant differences between Indian GAAP, Ind AS, and other accounting standards such 
as IFRS and U.S. GAAP, which may affect investors’ assessment of our financial position.  
 
We have not quantified the impact of U.S. GAAP or IFRS on our financial data, nor have we provided 
a reconciliation of our financial statements to these standards. As U.S. GAAP and IFRS differ 
significantly from Ind AS and Indian GAAP, the relevance of our financial statements in this document 
largely depends on the reader’s familiarity with Indian accounting practices. Therefore, those not 
familiar with Indian accounting standards should limit their reliance on the financial information 
presented. 
 
66. A slowdown in economic growth in India could cause our business to suffer. 
 
We are incorporated in India, and all of our assets and employees are located in India. As a result, we are 
highly dependent on prevailing economic conditions in India and our results of operations are 
significantly affected by factors influencing the Indian economy. A slowdown in the Indian economy  
could adversely affect our business, including our ability to grow our assets, the quality of our assets,  
and our ability to implement our strategy. 
 
Factors that may adversely affect the Indian economy, and hence our results of operations, may include: 
• any increase in Indian interest rates or inflation; 
• any scarcity of credit or other financing in India; 
• prevailing income conditions among Indian consumers and Indian corporations; 
• changes in India’s tax, trade, fiscal or monetary policies; 
• political instability, terrorism or military conflict in India or in countries in the region 
or globally, including in India’s various neighboring countries; 
• prevailing regional or global economic conditions; and 
• other significant regulatory or economic developments in or affecting India 
 
Any slowdown in the Indian economy or in the growth of the sectors we participate in or future volatility 
in global commodity prices could adversely affect our borrowers and contractual counterparties. This in 
turn could adversely affect our business and financial performance and the price of our Equity Shares. 
 
67. Changing laws, rules and regulations and legal uncertainties, including adverse application of 
corporate and tax laws, may adversely affect our business, prospects and results of operations. 
 
The regulatory and policy environment in which we operate is evolving and subject to change. Such 
changes, including the instances mentioned below, may adversely affect our business, results of 
operations and prospects, to the extent that we are unable to suitably respond to and comply with any 
such changes in applicable law and policy. 
 
The Government of India has issued a notification dated September 29, 2016, notifying Income 
Computation and Disclosure Standards ("ICDS"), thereby creating a new framework for the computation 
of taxable income. The ICDS became applicable from the assessment year for Fiscal 2018 and subsequent 
48 
years. The adoption of ICDS is expected to significantly alter the way companies compute their taxable 
income, as ICDS deviates from several concepts that are followed under general accounting standards, 
including Indian GAAP and Ind AS. In addition, ICDS shall be applicable for the computation of income 
for tax purposes but shall not be applicable for the computation of income for minimum alternate tax. 
There can be no assurance that the adoption of ICDS will not adversely affect our business, results of 
operations and financial condition: 
 
• the General Anti Avoidance Rules ("GAAR") have been made effective from April 1, 2017. The 
tax consequences of the GAAR provisions being applied to an arrangement could result in 
denial of tax benefit amongst other consequences. In the absence of any prece dents on the 
subject, the application of these provisions is uncertain. If the GAAR provisions are made 
applicable to our Company, it may have an adverse tax impact on us. 
 
• a comprehensive national GST regime that combines taxes and levies by the Central and State 
Governments into a unified rate structure, which came into effect from July 1, 2017. We cannot 
provide any assurance as to any aspect of the tax regime following implementation of the GST. 
Any future increases or amendments may affect the overall tax efficiency of companies 
operating in India and may result in significant additional taxes becoming payable. If, as a result 
of a particular tax risk materializing, the tax costs associated with certain transactions are greater 
than anticipated, it could affect the profitability of such transactions. 
 
In addition, unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing, or the promulgation of new laws, rules 
and regulations including foreign investment laws governing our business, operations and group structure 
could result in us being deemed to be in con travention of such laws or may require us to apply for 
additional approvals. We may incur increased costs and other burdens relating to compliance with such 
new requirements, which may also require significant management time and other resources, and any 
failure to comply may adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects. Uncertainty in 
the applicability, interpretation or implementation of any amendment to, or change in, governing law, 
regulation or policy, including by reason of an ab sence, or a limited body, of administrative or judicial 
precedent may be time consuming as well as costly for us to resolve and may affect the viability of our 
current business or restrict our ability to grow our business in the future.  
 
Any increase in taxes and levies, or the imposition of new taxes and levies in the future, could increase 
the cost of production and operating expenses. Taxes and other levies imposed by the central or state 
governments in India that affect our industry include customs duties, excise duties, sales tax, income tax 
and other taxes, duties or surcharges introduced on a permanent or temporary basis from time to time. 
The central and state tax scheme in India is extensive and subject to change from time to time.  Any 
adverse changes in any of the taxes levied by the central or state governments may adversely affect our 
competitive position and profitability. 
 
68. Financial instability in both Indian and international  financial markets could adversely affect our 
results of operations and financial condition. 
 
The Indian financial market and the Indian economy are influenced by economic and market conditions 
in other countries, particularly in emerging market in Asian countries. Financial turmoil in Asia, Europe, 
the United States and elsewhere in the world in r ecent years has affected the Indian economy. Although 
economic conditions are different in each country, investors’ reactions to developments in one country 
can have an adverse effect on the securities of companies in other countries. A loss in investor confidence 
in the financial systems of other emerging markets may cause increased volatility in in the Indian 
economy in general. Any global financial instability, including further deterioration of credit conditions 
in the U.S. market, could also have a negative impact on the Indian economy. Financial disruptions may 
occur again and could harm our results of operations and financial condition. 
The Indian economy is also influenced by economic and market conditions in other countries. This 
includes, but is not limited to, the conditions in the United States, Europe, and certain economies in Asia. 
Financial turmoil in Asia and elsewhere in the wor ld in recent years has affected the Indian economy. 
Any worldwide financial instability may cause increased volatility in the Indian financial markets and 
directly or indirectly, adversely affect the Indian economy and financial sector and its business.  
 
49 
Although economic conditions vary across markets, loss of investor confidence in one emerging 
economy may cause increased volatility across other economies, including India. Financial instability in 
other parts of the world could have a global influence and thereby impact the Indian economy. Financial 
disruptions in the future could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of 
operations. The global credit and equity markets have experienced substantial dislocations, liquidit y 
disruptions and market corrections. 
 
There are concerns that a tightening of monetary policy in emerging markets and some developed 
markets will lead to a moderation in global growth. In response to such developments, legislators and 
financial regulators in the United States and other jurisdi ctions, including India, have implemented a 
number of policy measures designed to add stability to the financial markets. However, the overall long- 
term impact of these and other legislative and regulatory efforts on the global financial markets is 
uncertain, and they may not have had the intended stabilizing effects. Any significant financial disruption 
in the future could have an adverse effect on our cost of funding, loan portfolio, business, future financial 
performance and the trading price of the Equity Shares. 
 
69. Inflation in India could have an adverse effect on our profitability and if significant, on our financial 
condition. 
 
Inflation rates in India have been volatile in recent years, and such volatility may continue in the future. 
India has experienced high inflation in the recent past. Increased inflation can contribute to an increase 
in interest rates and increased costs to  our business, including increased costs of salaries, and other 
expenses relevant to our business. 
 
High fluctuations in inflation rates may make it more difficult for us to accurately estimate or control our 
costs. Any increase in inflation in India can increase our expenses, which we may not be able to pass on 
to our customers, whether entirely or in part, and the same may adversely affect our business and financial 
condition. In particular, we might not be able to reduce our costs or increase our rates to pass the increase 
in costs on to our customers. In such case, our business, results of operations,  cash flows and financial 
condition may be adversely affected. 
 
Further, the GOI has previously initiated economic measures to combat high inflation rates and it is 
unclear whether these measures will remain in effect. There can be no assurance that Indian inflation 
levels will not worsen in the future. 
 
70. Foreign investors are subject to foreign investment restrictions under Indian law that limits our ability 
to attract foreign investors, which may adversely impact the market price of the Equity Shares.  
 
As an Indian Company, we are subject to exchange controls that regulate borrowing in foreign currencies, 
including those specified under FEMA. Such regulatory restrictions limit our financing sources and 
hence could constrain our ability to obtain financin g on competitive terms and refinance existing 
indebtedness. In addition, we cannot assure you that the required approvals will be granted to us without 
onerous conditions, or at all. Limitations on foreign debt may adversely affect our business growth, 
results of operations and financial condition. 
 
Further, under the foreign exchange regulations currently in force in India, transfers of shares between 
non- residents and residents are freely permitted (subject to certain exceptions) if they comply with the 
pricing guidelines and reporting requirements  specified by the RBI. If the transfer of shares, which are 
sought to be transferred, is not in compliance with such pricing guidelines or reporting requirements or 
fall under any of the exceptions referred to above, then the prior approval of the RBI will  be required. 
Additionally, shareholders who seek to convert the Rupee proceeds from a sale of shares in India into 
foreign currency and repatriate that foreign currency from India will require a no objection/ tax clearance 
certificate from the income tax authority. There can be no assurance that any approval required from the 
RBI or any other government agency can be obtained on any particular terms or at all.  
 
71. Any downgrading of India’s debt  rating by an independent agency may harm our ability to raise  
financing. 
 
50 
Any adverse revisions to India’s credit ratings international debt by international rating agencies may  
adversely affect our ability to raise additional overseas financing and the interest rates and other  
commercial terms at which such additional financing is available. This could have an adverse effect on  
our ability to fund our growth on favourable terms or at all, and consequently adversely affect our  
business and financial performance and the price of our Equity Shares. 
 
72. Natural calamities, climate change  and health epidemics and pandemics in India could adversely 
affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, hostilities, terrorist 
attacks, civil unrest and other acts of violence could adversely affect our business, results of operations 
and financial condition. 
 
India has experienced natural calamities, such as earthquakes and floods in recent years. Natural 
calamities could have an adverse impact on the Indian economy which, in turn, could adversely affect 
our business, and  may damage or destroy our solar, wind and other renewable power assets or other 
assets which are concentrated in one location. Any of these natural calamities could adversely affect our 
business, results of operations and financial condition. Our operations including our solar, wind and other 
renewable power in India may be damaged or disrupted as a result of natural calamities. Such events also 
may lead to the  disruption of information systems, electrical transmission distribution systems and 
telecommunication services for sustained periods. They also may make it difficult or impossible for 
employees to reach our  business locations. Damage or destruction that interrupts our solar, wind and 
other renewable power assets could adversely affect our reputation, our relationships with our customers, 
our senior management team ’s ability to administer and supervise our business or it may cause us to 
incur substantial additional expenditure  to repair or replace damaged equipment or rebuild parts of our 
renewable projects. Though some of the losses are covered under appropriate insurance, the above factors 
may still adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
India has from time -to-time experienced instances of social, religious and civil unrest and hostilities 
between neighbouring countries. Military activity or terrorist attacks in the future could influence the 
Indian economy by disrupting communications and making travel more difficult. Such political tensions 
also could create a  greater perception that investments in Indian companies involve higher degrees of 
risk. Events of this nature in the future, as well as social and civil unrest within other countrie s in Asia 
and Europe, could influence the Indian economy and could have a material adverse effect on the market 
for securities of Indian companies. 
 
73. We may be affected by competition law  in India and any adverse application or interpretation of the  
Competition Act may in turn adversely affect our business. 
 
The Competition Act, 2002, of India, as amended (“ Competition Act”), regulates practices having an  
appreciable adverse effect on competition in the relevant market in India (“ AAEC”). Under the 
Competition Act, any formal or informal arrangement, understanding, or action in concert, which causes 
or is likely to cause an AAEC, is considered void and may result in the imposition of substantial penalties. 
Further, any agreement among competitors which directly or indirectly involves the determination of 
purchase or sale  prices, limits or controls production, supply, markets, technical development, 
investment, or the provision of  services, or shares the market or source of production or provision of 
services in any manner, including by  way of allocation of geographical area or number of customers in 
the relevant market or directly or indirectly  results in bid -rigging or collusive bidding is presumed to 
have an AAEC and is considered void. The Competition Act also prohibits abuse of a dominant position 
by any enterprise. On April 11, 2023, the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2023 received the assent of the 
President of India to become the Competition (Amendment) Act, 2023 (“Competition Amendment Act”), 
amending the Competition Act and giving the  CCI additional powers to prevent practices that harm 
competition and the interests of consumers. It has been enacted to increase the ease of doing business in 
India and enhance transparency. The Competition  Amendment Act, inter alia, modifies the scope of 
certain factors used to determine AAEC, reduces the overall  time limit for the assessment of 
combinations by the CCI and empowers the CCI to impose penalties based  on the global turnover of 
entities, for anti-competitive agreements and abuse of dominant position. The  Competition Act aims to, 
among others, prohibit all agreements and transactions which may have an  AAEC in India. 
Consequently, all agreements entered by us could be within the purview of the Competition Act.  
 
51 
Further, the CCI has extraterritorial powers and can investigate any agreements, abusive conduct, or  
combination occurring outside India if such agreement, conduct, or combination has an AAEC in India.  
However, the impact of the provisions of the Competition Act on the agreements entered by us cannot 
be predicted with certainty at this stage. We may be affected, directly or indirectly, by the application or 
interpretation of any provision of the Competition Act, or any enforcement proceedings initiated by t he 
CCI, or any adverse publicity that may be generated due to scrutiny or prosecution by the CCI or if any 
prohibition or substantial penalties are levied under the Competition Act, it would adversely affect our 
business, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects. 
 
74. Investors may not be able to enforce a judgment of a foreign court against us. 
 
Our Company is a company incorporated under the laws of India. Our Board of Directors comprises 
members all of whom are Indian citizens. All of our Key Managerial Personnel and Senior Management 
are residents of India and majority of the assets of our Company and such persons are located in India. 
As a result, it may  not be possible for investors outside India to effect service of process upon our 
Company or such persons in India, or to enforce against them judgments obtained in courts outside India. 
India has reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters with only 
a limited number of jurisdictions, which includes, among others, the United Kingdom, Singapore, United 
Arab Emirates and Hong Kong. In  order to be enforceable, a judgment from a jurisdiction with 
reciprocity must meet certain requirements of  the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Judgments or decrees 
from jurisdictions, which do not have reciprocal  recognition with India, cannot be executed in India. 
Therefore, a f inal judgment for the payment of money  rendered by any court in a non -reciprocating 
territory for civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the general laws of the non-reciprocating 
territory, would not be enforceable in India. Even if an investor obtained a judgment in such a jurisdiction 
against us or our officers or directors, it may be required to institute a new proceeding in India and obtain 
a decree from an Indian court. However, the party in whose favour such  final judgment is rendered may 
bring a new suit in a competent court in India based on a final judgment that has been obtained in a non-
reciprocating territory within three years of obtaining such final judgment in the  same manner as any 
other suit filed to enforce a civil liability in India. If, and to the extent that, an Indian  court were of the 
opinion that fairness and good faith so required, it w ould, under current practice, give  binding effect to 
the final judgment that had been rendered in the non -reciprocating territory, unless such a  judgment 
contravenes principles of public policy in India. It is unlikely that an Indian court would award damages 
on the same basis or to the same extent as was awarded in a final judgment rendered by a court in another 
jurisdiction if the Indian court believed that the amount of damages awarded was excessive or  
inconsistent with Indian practice. In addition, any person seeking to enforce a foreign judgment in India 
is required to obtain prior approval of the RBI to repatriate any amount recovered pursuant to the 
execution of such a judgment. 
 
75. We are subject to regulatory, economic, social  and political uncertainties and other factors beyond 
our control. 
 
We are incorporated in India, and we conduct our corporate affairs and our business in India. 
Consequently, our business, operations, financial performance will be affected by interest rates, 
government policies, taxation, social and ethnic instability and  other political and economic 
developments affecting India. 
 
Factors that may adversely affect the Indian economy, and hence our results of operations may include:  
a) any exchange rate fluctuations, the imposition of currency controls and restrictions on the right to convert 
or repatriate currency or export assets; 
b) any scarcity of credit or other financing in India, resulting in an adverse effect on economic conditions in 
India and scarcity of financing for our expansions; 
c) prevailing income conditions among Indian customers and Indian corporations; 
d) epidemic or any other public health in India or in countries in the region or globally, including in India’s 
various neighbouring countries; 
e) hostile or war like situations with the neighbouring countries; 
f) macroeconomic factors and central bank regulation, including in relation to interest rates movements 
which may in turn adversely impact our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs; 
g) decline in India’s foreign exchange reserves which may affect liquidity in the Indian economy; 
h) downgrading of India’s sovereign debt rating by rating agencies; 
52 
i) difficulty in developing any necessary partnerships with local businesses on commercially acceptable 
terms and/or a timely basis; and 
 
Any slowdown or perceived slowdown in the Indian economy, or in specific sectors of the Indian 
economy or certain regions in India, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and 
financial condition and the price of the Equity Shares. 
 
76. Our business is affected by global economic  conditions, which may have an adverse effect on our 
business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
The Indian economy and its securities markets are influenced by global economic developments and 
volatility in securities markets in other countries. Investors ’ reactions to developments in one country 
may have adverse  effects on the market price of securities of companies located in other countries, 
including India. Negative economic developments, such as rising fiscal or trade deficits, or a default on 
national debt, in other emerging  market countries may also affect investor confidence and cause 
increased volatility in Indian securities markets and indirectly affect the Indian economy in general. Any 
worldwide financial instability could also have a negative impact on the Indian economy, including the 
movement of exchange rates and interest rates  in India and could then adversely affect our business, 
financial performance and the price of our Equity Shares. China is one of India’s major trading partners 
and there are rising concerns of a strained relationship with  India, which could have an adverse impact 
on the trade relations between the two countries.  Developments in the ongoing conflict between Russia 
and Ukraine, Israel and Hamas, Iran and the Houthi  rebels and certain western countries, have resulted 
in and may continue to result in a period o f sustained instability across global financial markets, induce 
volatility in commodity prices, adversely impact availability  of natural gas, increase in supply chain, 
logistics times and costs, increase borrowing costs, cause outflow of capital from emerging markets and 
may lead to overall slowdown in economic activity in India.  If we are unable to successfully anticipate 
and respond to changing economic and market conditions, our  business, results of operations and 
financial condition may be adversely affected. 
 
77. Changing regulations in India could lead to new compliance requirements that are uncertain. 
 
The regulatory and policy environment in which we operate is evolving and is subject to change. The 
GoI or State governments in India may implement new laws or other regulations and policies that could 
affect our business in general, which could lead to new compliance requirements, including requiring us 
to obtain approvals and licenses from the GoI, State governments and other regulatory bodies, or impose 
onerous requirements.  
 
Uncertainty in the applicability, interpretation or implementation of any amendment to, or change in,  
governing law, regulation or policy in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including by reason of an  
absence, or a limited body, of administrative or judicial precedent maybe time consuming as well as 
costly for us to resolve and may impact the viability of our current business or restrict our ability to grow 
our business in the future. We may incur increased costs and other burdens relating to compliance with 
such new requirements, which may also require significant management time and other resources, and 
any failure to comply may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

subscription of at least 90% of the Issue. It further states that the minimum subscription criteria shall not be 
applicable if the object of the issue involves financing other than financing of capital expenditure for a project and 
the promoters and the promoter group undertake to subscribe fully to their portion of rights entitlement and do not 
renounce their rights except to the extent of renunciation within the promoter group. 
 
A major part of the Net Proceeds will be used to set up 4 MW solar power plant in Karnataka State, which is 
financing of capital expenditure for a project. The minimum subscription criteria (of at least 90% of the Issue) 
will, therefore, apply to this Issue. 
 
Regulation 86(2) of the SEBI ICDR Regulations states that in the event of non -receipt of minimum subscription, 
all application monies shall be refunded to the applicants not later than four days from closure of the issue.  Since 
unsubscribed portion shall be subscribed by the Promoter and Promoter group over and above their rights 
entitlements and  the Underwriter has underwritten to the extent of ₹2000.10 Lakhs for achieving minimum 
subscription, no money shall be refunded.

bonds and directed the Trustee to withdraw the  winding-up pr oceedings. At the hearing held on 
December 13, 2024, before the Hon’ble High Court of Madras, the Trustee sought the Court’s permission 
to withdraw the said proceedings.  After hearing the parties to the  winding-up proceedings. the Hon’ble

In case of any increase in the estimates of funds earmarked for the Objects, such additional funds for a 
particular activity will be met by way of means available to our Company, including from internal 
accruals or short term debt. 
 
The fund requirements, the deployment of funds and the intended use of the Net Proceeds, for the 
proposed project, as described herein are based on our current business plan, management estimates, 
current and valid quotations from EPC contractor, other commercial and technical factors. However, such 
total estimated cost and related fund requirements have not been appraised by any bank or financial

factors such as our financial and market condition, business and strategy, competition and interest or 
exchange rate fluctuations and other external factors, which may not be within the control of our 
management. This may entail rescheduling or revising the planned  expenditure, and funding 
requirements, including the expenditure for a particular purpose at the discretion of our management, 
subject to compliance with the applicable laws. Furthermore, in the event of shortfall of funds or cost 
overrun for reasons beyo nd control including delay in commissioning of the proposed project, we may 
have to reduce the installed capacity of the proposed project in order to reduce costs and expedite timely

2. Repayment of Secured and Unsecured Loan availed from Corporate Promoters 
 
Our Company has entered into loan arrangements with the corporate Promoters of our company . The 
loan has been extended by way of Term Loan. As on June 30, 2025, the aggregate outstanding borrowings 
of our Company on a standalone basis is ₹ 1,129.58 Lakhs. 
 
Our Subsidiaries have not availed any borrowings from banks or financial institutions and have no loans 
outstanding. 
 
In 2010, EXIM Bank of India (“EXIM Bank”) had sanctioned a term loan of Euro 18 million (equivalent 
to USD 25 million) to our Company under its Import Finance Programme. This term loan was to part 
finance our Company’s expansion project of 25 MW Wind Mill project.  
 
Subsequently, EXIM Bank stated that the term loan limit had expired and released only an aggregate of 
USD 12.70 million in 2011 and 2013. Our Company used the funds to set up an 8 MW Wind Mill project 
in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.  
 
Our Company approached EXIM Bank with a request to rephrase the loan instalments in line with the 
income generated from the project. After detailed discussions, our Company decided to repay the term 
loan to EXIM Bank.  
 
To repay EXIM Bank, our Company borrowed funds from its two corporate promoters, LCIL and IFL in 
the form of ICDs. Our Company used the ICDs to repay the part of the EXIM Bank term loan and clear 
all outstanding dues to EXIM Bank. The balance of EXIM Bank term loan, including outstanding 
interest, was repaid from internal accruals and previous fund raise. 
 
Our Company intends, inter alia, to de-leverage its financial position and hence, proposes to utilise an 
estimated amount of ₹ 1,100 Lakhs from the Net Proceeds towards repayment/ prepayment, in part or 
full, of all or a portion of the outstanding borrowings of our Company.  
 
The repayment/ prepayment, will help reduce our outstanding indebtedness, assist us in maintaining a 
favourable debt-equity ratio, reduce our interest outflow and enable utilisation of some additional amount 
from our internal accruals for further investmen t in business growth and expansion. In addition, we 
believe that any improvement in debt-equity ratio will enable us to raise further resources at competitive 
rates and additional funds / capital in the future to fund potential business development opportunities and 
plans to grow and expand our business in the future. Given the nature of these borrowings and the terms 
of repayment/prepayment, the aggregate outstanding borrowing amounts may vary from time to time. 
Further, the amounts outstanding under these borrowings are dependent on several factors.

OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ECONOMY 
 
India’s real GDP grew by 6.2% in Q3 FY25, up from 5.6% in the Q2 FY25, indicating sustained momentum. 
Over the past five years, GDP growth remained strong, rising from 6.8% in FY19 to 8.2% in FY24. For FY25, 
real GDP is projected to grow at 6.5%, despite t he current fiscal slowdown primarily driven by a general decline 
in consumer spending and a contraction in central government expenditure. However, the outlook remains positive 
as easier monetary policy and a reduction in the tax burden are expected to boo st consumption demand. 
 
Additionally, export performance has experienced remarkable growth over the past decade, reflecting the 
increasing credibility and demand for Indian products in the global marketplace. India's total exports touched Rs. 
67,58,486 crore (US$ 778 billion) in FY24, a significant increase from Rs. 40,48,142 crore (US$ 466 billion) in 
FY14, representing a growth of nearly 67%. During this period, India's share of world merchandise exports also 
improved, rising from 1.66% to 1.81%, advancing the country from 20th to 17th position globally. 
 
The demographic transition, marked by a lower infant mortality rate and a consistent growth in literacy rates, 
further enhances India's advantageous position. 
 
With improved income distribution, heightened employment rates, and globally competitive social amenity 
provisions, there is potential for India's per capita GDP to expand in the next 25 years, mirroring the growth seen 
in the preceding 75 years.

upturn in sales. The growth impetus  in rail freight and port traffic remains upbeat, with further improvement in 
the domestic aviation sector. Strong growth in fuel demand, domestic vehicle sales, and high UPI transactions 
also reflect healthy demand conditions. 
 
The narrowing merchandise trade deficit and the upward trajectory of net services receipts are anticipated to 
contribute to an enhancement in India's current account deficit. 
 
The Union Budget 2025 -26, themed "Sabka Vikas," focuses on balanced growth across regions. It prioritizes 
agriculture, MSMEs, investment, and exports as key growth engines. Initiatives include the Prime Minister Dhan-
Dhaanya Krishi Yojana for agriculture, support for first -time entrepreneurs, and a push for domestic 
manufacturing through customs duty rationalization. The budget also emphasises education, healthcare, and 
infrastructure development, with plans for 50,000 Atal Tinkering Labs and new medical co lleges. 
 
In the near future, India’s banking and financial sector is expected to thrive. Despite foreign investors booking 
profits in the capital market, the outlook remains largely positive for the country. As global conditions stabilise, 
foreign investors are expected to re-enter the market and capture the upcoming growth wave. The collective efforts 
82 
invested over the past several years have laid a robust foundation, providing a sturdy platform upon which the 
framework of a middle-income economy can be built. 
 
INDIAN POWER SECTOR 
 
Power is one of the most important infrastructure elements, essential to national wellbeing and economic 
development. For the Indian economy to grow steadily, enough electrical infrastructure must exist and be 
developed. India’s power generation sources ra nge from conventional sources such as coal, lignite, natural gas, 
oil, hydro and nuclear power to viable non-conventional sources such as wind, solar, and agricultural and domestic 
waste. 
 
Indian power sector is undergoing a significant change that has redefined the industry outlook. Sustained 
economic growth continues to drive electricity demand in India. The Government of India’s focus on attaining 
‘Power for all’ has accelerated capacity addition in the country. Although power generation has grown more than 
100-fold since independence, growth in demand has been even higher due to accelerating economic activity.  
 
India is the third -largest producer and consumer of electricity worldwide, with an installed power capacity of 
466.24 GW as of January 31, 2025. 
 
As of December 2024, India has a total installed capacity of 209.45 GW for renewable energy sources, including 
large hydropower. The breakdown is as follows: Wind power at 48.16 GW, solar power at 97.87 GW, biomass/co-
generation at 10.73 GW, small hydro po wer at 5.10 GW, waste to energy at 0.62 GW, and large hydro at 46.97 
GW. This diverse mix highlights India's significant strides in expanding renewable energy infrastructure for a 
more sustainable energy future. 
 
The non-hydro renewable energy capacity addition stood at 15.27 GW in FY23, up from 14.07 GW in FY22.  
 
India's energy firms have made significant progress in the global energy sector. According to the S&P Global 
Platts Top 250 Global Energy Rankings 2022, Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd. ranked 14th.  
 
India ranked fourth in the list of countries to make significant investments in renewable energy by allotting US$ 
77.7 billion between 2015 and 2022. Total FDI inflows in the power sector reached US$ 19.59 billion between 
April 2000-September 2024, accounting for 2.76% of the total FDI inflow in India. 
 
As per the National Infrastructure Pipeline 2019-25, energy sector projects accounted for the highest share (24%) 
out of the total expected capital expenditure of Rs. 111 lakh crore (US$ 1.4 trillion).  
 
Investments in the renewable energy space have increased significantly over the past few years. SJVN Limited is 
looking to develop 10,000 MW solar power projects inviting investment of Rs. 50,000 crore (US$ 6.56 billion) in 
the next five years in Rajasthan . Adani Group has announced an investment of US$ 20 billion over the next 10 
years in renewable energy generation and component manufacturing. NTPC has announced that it would invest 
Rs. 2-2.5 crore (US$ 0.27-0.34 million) over the next 10 years to expand renewable capacity. 
 
The nation plans to invest Rs. 9,15,920 crore (US$ 107 billion) by 2032 to develop additional transmission lines, 
supporting its goal to nearly triple its clean power capacity. 
 
India’s electricity generation from renewable and non-renewable sources for FY21, FY22, and FY23 was 1,373.08 
BU, 1,484.36 BU, and 1,617.72 BU, respectively. 
 
The power generation industry in India will require a total investment of Rs. 33 lakh crore (US$ 400 billion) and 
3.78 million power professionals by 2032 to meet the rising energy demands, as per the National Electricity Plan 
2022-32. 
 
In FY25 (until December 2024), the power generation in India was 1,378.42 BU.  
 
The peak power demand in the country stood at 249.85 GW in September 2024.  
 
83 
Electrification in the country is increasing with support from schemes like Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti 
Yojana (DDUGJY), Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY), and Integrated Power Development Scheme 
(IPDS). India has also launched the Mission Innovation  Clean Tech Exchange, a global initiative that will create 
a whole network of incubators across member countries to accelerate clean energy innovation.  
 
The Union Budget 2025 -26 marks the launch of a Nuclear Energy Mission, which focuses on the Research and 
Development (R&D) of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). The government has allocated Rs. 20,000 crore (US$ 
2.33 billion) for this initiative, with the aim of developing at least five indigenously designed and operational 
SMRs by 2033. 
 
The Union Budget outlines a strategy for the development of Bharat Small Reactors (BSRs), which are designed 
to reduce land requirements and support industries in decarbonization efforts. Under this plan, private sector 
entities will provide land, cooling water, and capital, while the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited 
(NPCIL) will be responsible for the design, quality assurance, operation, and maintenance of the reactors.  
 
India is set to become a global manufacturing hub with investment across the value chain. The Central Electricity 
Authority (CEA) estimates India’s power requirement to grow to reach 817 GW by 2030. The government plans 
to establish renewable energy capacity of 500 GW by 2030.

The Government of India has identified the power sector as a key sector of focus to promote sustained industrial 
growth. Some initiatives by the Government to boost the Indian power sector are as below:  
• India has unveiled a comprehensive plan worth Rs. 9.15 lakh crore (US$ 109.50 billion) to enhance its 
power infrastructure and meet a projected demand of 458 GW by 2032. This initiative, led by the Ministry 
of Power under Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi, aims to strengthen the national power grid and boost 
energy security. The Government of India has approved new Inter State Transmission System (ISTS) 
schemes to evacuate 9 GW of RE power from Rajasthan and Karnataka. These schemes will be 
implemented through Tariff Based Competitive Bidding (TBCB) mode. These schemes are part of 500 
GW RE capacity by 2030 out of which 200 GW is already connected. 
• The Union Cabinet has sanctioned the PM -Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana. This initiative, with a total 
budget of Rs. 75,021 crore (US$ 9 billion) aims to install rooftop solar systems and offer complimentary 
electricity of up to 300 units per month to one crore households. 
• The Union Budget 2025-26 marks the launch of a Nuclear Energy Mission, which focuses on the research 
and development (R&D) of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). The government has allocated Rs. 20,000 
crore (US$ 2.33 billion) for this initiative, with the aim of developing at least five indigenously designed 
and operational SMRs by 2033. 
• The Union Budget 2025 -26 outlines a strategy for the development of Bharat Small Reactors (BSRs), 
which are designed to reduce land requirements and support industries in decarbonization efforts. Under 
this plan, private sector entities will provide land, cooling water, and capital, while the Nuclear Power 
Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) will be responsible for the design, quality assurance, operation, 
and maintenance of the reactors. 
• In the Union Budget 2025 -26, the government boosted its flagship rooftop solar initiative, PM Surya 
Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana, by allocating Rs. 20,000 crore (US$ 2.33 billion) an 80% increase to fast-track 
the deployment of rooftop solar projects. 
• In the Budget for 2024, the government's power sector initiatives have been allocated funds that are 50% 
higher. Increased funds have been allocated to green hydrogen, solar power, and green -energy corridors 
in line with the renewable energy target for 2030. 
• In the Union Budget 2022-23, the government allocated Rs. 7,327 crore (US$ 885 million) for the solar 
power sector including grid, off-grid, and PM-KUSUM projects. 
• Under the Union Budget 2022-23, the government announced the issuance of sovereign green bonds, as 
well as conferring infrastructure status to energy storage systems, including grid -scale battery systems. 
84 
• The Green Energy Corridor projects have been initiated to facilitate renewable power evacuation and 
reshaping the grid for future requirements. As on October 2022, 8651 km of intra-state transmission lines 
have been constructed and 19,558 MVA intra-state substations have been charged. 
• To encourage rooftop solar (RTS) throughout the country, Ministry New and Renewable Energy has 
developed a National Portal wherein any residential consumer from any part of the country can apply for 
rooftop solar without waiting for Discom to finalize tend er and empanel vendors. Since the launch 
on July 30, 2022, the total number of applications received on the national portal is for 117 MW solar 
capacity and the feasibility of more than 18 MW projects is granted. 
• Production Linked Incentive Scheme (Tranche II) on ‘National Programme on High Efficiency Solar PV 
Modules,’ with an outlay of Rs. 19,500 crore (US$ 2.47 billion) was approved and launched.  
• As of August 24, 2022, over 36.86 crore LED bulbs, 72.18 lakh LED tube lights and 23.59 lakh energy-
efficient fans have been distributed across the country, saving around 48,411 million kWh per year and 
around Rs. 19,332 crore (US$ 2.35 billion) in cost savings. 
• As of November 2022, over 51.62 lakh smart metres have been deployed under the National Smart Grid 
Mission (NSGM), with a further 61.13 lakh to be deployed. 
• Electrification in the country is increasing with support from schemes like Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gram 
Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY), and Integrated Power 
Development Scheme (IPDS). 
• In order to meet India’s 500 GW renewable energy target and tackle the annual issue of coal demand 
supply mismatch, the Ministry of Power has identified 81 thermal units which will replace coal with 
renewable energy generation by 2026. 
• In February 2022, a parliamentary standing committee recommended the government to take steps to 
increase the loan limit for renewable energy sector under priority sector lending. The current limit stands 
at Rs. 30 crore (U$ 3.93 million). 
• In December 2021, West Bengal got a loan approval for US$ 135 million from the International Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development (also called the World Bank) to improve the operational efficiency 
and reliability of electricity supply in select regions in the state. 
• In November 2021, the government announced future plans to increase the funding under the PLI scheme 
for domestic solar cells and module manufacturing to Rs. 24,000 crore (US$ 3.17 billion) from the 
existing Rs. 4,500 crore (US$ 594.68 million) to make India an exporting nation. 
• In November 2021, Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) stated that it will partner with private 
sector energy service companies to scale up its Building Energy Efficiency Programme (BEEP).  
• In September 2021, the Government of the United Kingdom announced that it will invest US$ 1.2 billion 
through public and private investments in green projects and renewable energy in India to support the 
latter’s target of 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030. 
• The Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana, “Saubhagya,” was launched by the Government of 
India with an aim of achieving universal household electrification. As of March 2021, 2.82 crore 
households have been electrified under this scheme. 
• According to the S&P Global Platts Top 250 Global Energy Rankings 2021, Reliance Industries Ltd. and 
Indian Oil Corp. Ltd. ranked 3rd and 6th, respectively. 
 
❖ ROAD AHEAD 
 
In the current decade (2020 -29), the Indian electricity sector is likely to witness a major transformation 
with respect to demand growth, energy mix and market operations. India wants to ensure that everyone 
has reliable access to sufficient electricity at all times, while also accelerating the clean energy transition 
by lowering its reliance on dirty fossil fuels and moving toward more environmentally friendly, 
renewable sources of energy. Future investments will benefit from strong demand fundamentals, po licy 
support and increasing government focus on infrastructure. 
 
The Government of India is preparing a 'rent a roof' policy for supporting its target of generating 40 GW 
of power through solar rooftop projects by 2022. It also plans to set up 21 new nuclear power reactors 
with a total installed capacity of 15,700 MW by 2031. 
 
The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) estimates India’s power requirement to grow to reach 817 GW 
by 2030. Also, by 2029-30, CEA estimates that the share of renewable energy generation would increase 
from 18% to 44%, while that of thermal energy is expected to reduce from 78% to 52%. 
85 
 
The government plans to establish renewable energy capacity of 500 GW by 2030.

ASSESSMENT OF GLOBAL WIND ENERGY LANDSCAPE 
 
Global Wind Energy Overview  
 
116.6 GW of new wind power capacity was added to the power grid worldwide in 2023, 50% more than in 2022, 
bringing total installed wind capacity to 1,021 GW, a growth of 13% compared with last year. 
 
New installations in the onshore wind market passed the milestone of 100 GW while new offshore wind capacity 
commissioned last year reached nearly 11 GW, making 2023 the highest and the second -highest year in history 
for new wind installations for onshore and offshore, respectively. 
 
Thanks to the strong rebound of new installations in China and India, Asia Pacific consolidated its position as the 
world’s largest wind market last year with 71% global market share, experiencing a 15% YoY growth compared 
with 2022.  
 
As the second-largest market, Europe commissioned 18.3 GW of new wind power capacity, of which 16.2 GW in 
the EU-27, representing a record amount for the bloc. However, Europe’s global market share declined by 9% 
YoY in 2023. 
 
Despite North America retaining third place, its market share decreased by five percentage points due to onshore 
wind installations in the US dropping to their lowest level since 2014. Brazil had a record year in 2023 and Latin 
America remained the fourth largest market with a 5% global market share in 2023, followed by Africa & Middle 
East (0.9%). 
 
The world’s top five markets for new installations in 2023 were China, the US, Brazil, Germany and India. 
 
Compared with 2022, the only change is that India overtook fifth place, a position previously held by Sweden. 
Together, the top five markets made up 80% of global new installations in 2023, collectively 9% higher than the 
previous year. 
 
This is primarily due to China’s global market share surging by 16% points compared with 2022. 
 
The top five markets by total wind power installations at the end of 2023 remained unchanged: China, the US, 
Germany, India and Spain together made up 72% of the world’s total wind power installations in 2023, the same 
percentage as the previous year.

version_final-1-compressed.pdf) 
 
Offshore Wind Market Status (2023): 
 
2023 saw annual onshore wind installations surpass the 100 GW milestone for the first time. With 105.8 GW of 
new onshore wind capacity added to the grid last year, global cumulative onshore wind capacity reached 945 GW, 
a YoY growth of 12%. 
 
Asia Pacific and Latin America had a record year mainly due to the outstanding performance of China and Brazil. 
Although Europe and Africa & Middle East did not beat the previous record, the two regions still experienced 
their second-best years in new onshore wind installations last year.  
 
Total onshore wind additions in North America, however, dropped by 16% in 2023 compared with the previous 
year. The decline was driven primarily by the slowdown of onshore wind growth in the world’s second -largest 
wind power market – the US. 
 
Since 2021, China’s onshore wind development has been driven by a market support mechanism called ‘grid 
parity’, meaning that electricity generated by onshore wind would be remunerated in every province with the same 
regulated price as coal power. 
 
After two years of relatively low growth, onshore wind installations in China finally bounced back in 2023 with 
grid-connected wind capacity surpassing 69 GW, a new record. Such explosive growth has demonstrated that the 
country is on track to reach its ‘30-60’ target of peak emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. 
 
In the US, the IRA propelled renewable energy investment across the country, including in the domestic wind 
supply chain.  
 
Developers installed more new wind capacity in the fourth quarter than the previous three quarters combined, and 
only 6.4 GW of onshore wind capacity was added last year, the lowest level since 2014. After record installation 
levels in 2020 and 2021, the amount of new capacity entering  the onshore wind pipeline has stalled. Wind 
installations last year were depressed by market saturation in certain areas and delays caused by permitting, supply 
chain constraints, inflation and grid interconnection. However, the situation is expected to change in 2024, with a 
strong onshore market expected to return from 2025. 
 
In addition to China and the US, the top onshore wind markets were Brazil (4.8 GW), Germany (2.4 GW) and 
India (2.8 GW).  
 
‘Grid parity’ in China, tax credits in the US and auction/tenders elsewhere remain the top three market support 
mechanisms behind the new onshore wind capacity added in 2023, collectively accounting for a combined 95% 
market share, 4% higher than the previous year. 

87 
 
Feed-in Tariff support schemes gained a small amount of market share compared with 2022, mainly due to Japan 
achieving a record year in onshore wind installations.  
 
Excluding China, in 2023, onshore wind capacity awarded worldwide through wind-specific, technology neutral, 
renewable and hybrid auctions increased by 73% compared with 2022. The total reached 23.7 GW, of which more 
than half was in Europe. 
 
The total onshore wind volume awarded in 2023 amounted to 6.4 
 
  
The total onshore wind volume awarded in 2023 amounted to 6.4 GW in Germany, nearly double the volume 
awarded in the previous year. 
 
GW in Germany, nearly double the volume awarded in the previous year. This progress is credited to a higher bid 
price ceiling and the implementation of EU emergency measures that improve and streamline permitting to further 
accelerate renewable energy proj ects. However, to shed the EU’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels while 
meeting climate targets, the current volume of annual wind power auctions in Europe is not enough and their pace 
needs to speed up further.  
 
China approved 27.5 GW of onshore wind capacity under the ‘grid parity’ mechanism in 2023, with another 51 
GW of announced onshore wind capacity under the same support mechanism expected to be approved by the 
provincial governments this year.

version_final-1-compressed.pdf) 
 
Offshore Wind Market –Status 2023 
 
10.8 GW of new offshore wind capacity was fed into the grid worldwide last year, bringing the total global offshore 
wind capacity to 75.2 GW by the end of 2023.  New additions were 24% higher than the previous year, making 
2023 the second-highest year in offshore wind history.  
 
• China led the world in annual offshore wind developments for the sixth year in a row with 6.3 GW added 
in 2023, bringing its total offshore wind installations to 38 GW, 3.7 GW (11%) higher than Europe. Last 
year was the second year since the Chinese offsho re wind market entered the era of ‘grid parity’. 
Following a 70% YoY decline in new installations in 2022, GWEC Market Intelligence predicted that 
the offshore wind growth momentum would return last year. This was based on around 15 GW of offshore 
wind contracts having been awarded to wind turbine OEMs in 2022 and more than 30 offshore wind 
projects, totalling 14.8 GW, being under construction in China by Q1 2023. However, last year ended up 
being relatively flat. This was mainly due to an intervention from the central government, starting in Q2 
2023, to ensure that the offshore wind industry would develop at a healthy pace.  

88 
 
• Europe had a record year in 2023, with 3.8 GW of new offshore wind capacity from 11 wind farms 
commissioned across six markets accounting for most of the new capacity. 
 
• The Netherlands commissioned 1.9 GW of offshore wind capacity in 2023, replacing the UK as the 
region’s largest market in terms of new additions. More than 170 units of SGRE’s SG -11 DD offshore 
wind turbines were connected across the Hollandse Kust Noord (760 MW) and the Hollandse Kust Zuid 
1-4 (1.5 GW) wind farms. 
 
• The UK connected 833 MW of capacity offshore, of which 820 MW from the remaining wind turbines 
at the 1.1 GW Seagreen and 13 MW from the 1.2 GW Dogger Bank (phase A) projects. Seven Haliade -
X 13 MW offshore wind turbines were mechanically installed at the latter last year, but only one unit 
was commissioned.  
 
• France commissioned 360 MW of offshore wind in 2023. At the Fécamp (250 MW) and Saint -Brieuc 
(496 MW) wind farms, 49 SGRE offshore wind turbines were grid -connected. The remaining turbines 
(84 units) are expected to be commissioned later this year. 
 
• Denmark installed 41 units of SGRE’s SG -8.0-167 DD wind turbines at the Vesterhav Syd and Nord 
wind farms in the North Sea last October, with the two small projects fully commissioned at the beginning 
of this year.  
 
• In the German Baltic Sea, the Arcadis Ost 1 offshore wind project comprising 27 Vestas V174 -9.5 MW 
offshore wind turbines was fully connected to the grid before the end of 2023.  
 
• In Norway, the remaining four SGRE SG-8.6-167DD wind turbines, which were installed on a concrete 
SPAR-type floating foundation at the 94.6 MW Hywind Tampen floating wind project, were connected 
last year making it the world’s largest floating wind project. 
 
• Elsewhere, a total of 13 MW of floating wind capacity was commissioned in 2023. It included a 2MW 
floating demo, DemoSATH, in Spain and two units – a 7.25MW anti-typhoon machine from Mingyang 
and a 4 MW wind turbine from Shanghai Electric – installed on threecolumn semi-submersible floating 
platforms in China. 
 
• Outside of China and Europe, three other markets commissioned new offshore wind capacity last year. 
Taiwan (China) commissioned 692 MW of offshore wind turbines across Formosa II, Yunlin, Greater 
Changhua 1 & 2a and Changfang Phase 2 in 2023. In Japan, all the turbines at the 140 MW Akita Noshiro 
Port wind farm were installed by the end of 2022, but the 55 MW Akita Port project was not 
commissioned until the end of January 2023. Additionally, the Nyuzen offshore wind project, consisting 
of three units of Mi ngyang’s MySE 3.0MW typhoon-proof wind turbines, was completed last October. 
In South Korea, one unit of 4.2 MW offshore wind prototype was installed by Hanjin last year. 
 
• The US is the only market with offshore wind in operation in the Americas. GE Vernova installed six 
Haliade-X 13 DD offshore wind turbines at the 806 MW Vineyard Wind 1 wind project, and SGRE also 
installed a few turbines at the 130 MW South Fork Wind project before the end of last year. However, no 
offshore turbines were commissioned in 2023 according to American Clean Power (ACP).  
 
• In total offshore wind installations, China took the crown from the UK in 2021 and further consolidated 
its global market share in the past two years. Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark are the other three 
markets that make up the top five, as was the case in 2022. 
 
89 
 
 
The offshore wind market has grown from 1.6 GW in 2013 to 10.8 GW in 2023, taking its market share in global 
new installations from 4% to 9%. GWEC Market Intelligence expects the global offshore wind market to continue 
to grow at an accelerated pace (for details, see Market Outlook).

version_final-1-compressed.pdf) 
 
Allocation mechanisms 
 
With 39.4 GW of offshore wind capacity awarded worldwide, 2023 was a record year. Excluding China, where 
18.2 GW of offshore wind projects were allocated under the ‘grid -parity’ mechanism, 21.2 GW of offshore wind 
capacity was awarded through auctioning, of which 15.5 GW in Europe, 4 GW in the US, and 1.4 GW in Japan. 
 
In Europe, Germany awarded 8.8 GW of offshore wind via a zero-subsidy tender. Out of this, 7 GW across four 
sites was centrally pre-surveyed and featured a ‘dynamic bidding’ system. The remaining 1.8 GW awarded across 
four sites was not centrally resurveyed.  
 
Ireland awarded 3.1 GW of offshore wind capacity through its first offshore wind energy auction, ORESS 1. 
Following suit, France awarded 1 GW of offshore wind for the Centre Manche 1 site, and Lithuania awarded 700 
MW from its first offshore wind auction.  
 
No energy companies submitted bids to the UK’s CfD Allocation Round 5 (AR5) auction last year, primarily due 
to the strike prices being too low and not reflecting rising costs. In response to the challenges facing the wind 
industry, however, the bid price ceilings under CfD AR6 were increased to £73/MWh (€83.9/ MWh) for bottom -
fixed offshore wind and to £176/MWh (€202.3/ MWh) for floating offshore wind. 
 
Moving beyond the turbulence in 2023 
 
In 2023, a ‘perfect storm’ battered the offshore wind industry. 
 
Challenges such as inflation, increased capital costs and supply chain constraints including for vessels created 
uncertainty in the sector, forcing developers to renegotiate signed project contracts and, in some cases, to even 

90 
terminate offtake agreements and stop project development due for construction in the next five years (2023 -
2027). 
 
In addition to the 1.4 GW Norfolk Boreas offshore wind farm that had won the UK’s CfD AR4 auction in 2022, 
ten offshore wind projects totalling 10.9 GW off the east coast of the US were affected by supply chain and 
financial challenges. Of these, five proj ects totalling 5.5 GW – Ocean Wind 1&2, Commonwealth Wind, Park 
City Wind and SouthCoast Wind – saw their offtake agreements terminated or the whole project development 
cancelled. 
 
Four projects located in New York tried to renegotiate their PPA price last year, but their request was denied by 
the New York State Public Service Commission.  
 
However, the state launched its fourth, expedited offshore wind solicitation in December 2023 and allowed 
projects that previously petitioned the Commission for financial relief to participate.  
 
Despite all the turbulence experienced in 2023, governments and developers have retained their commitments to 
develop offshore wind. It is the industry’s consensus that the worst has passed, and the offshore wind sector has 
entered 2024 poised for a new wave of growth. 
 
In the US, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) selected in February 
2024 Equinor’s Empire Wind 1 (810 MW) and Ørsted and Eversource’s Sunrise Wind (924 MW) projects in the 
state’s fourth offshore wind solicitation. Both p rojects had previously secured agreements with the state and re -
bid in the latest procurement round to negotiate new 25-year contracts. 
 
In the UK, the government announced in March 2024 that it would provide GBP 800 million (EUR 936 million) 
to support offshore wind in the CfD AR6, which is expected to procure approximately 4 -6 GW of offshore wind. 
According to GWEC Market Intelligence’s g lobal wind auction database, 2024 will be a record year in offshore 
wind auctions, with more than 60 GW of offshore wind capacity expected to go through auctions and lease 
processes. 
 
(Reference: GWEC | Global Wind Report 2024 - https://img.saurenergy.com/2024/05/gwr-2024 digital-
version_final-1-compressed.pdf) 
 
All regions increased new installations, except North America and Europe  
 
Annual wind installations (onshore  and offshore combined) increased in all regions except North America and 
Europe in 2023, with a YoY growth rate of 50.3%.  
 
• Onshore wind: Asia Pacific and LATAM had a record year in 2023 with YoY growth rates of 106% and 
21%, respectively. Last year also saw onshore wind installation in Africa & Middle East increase by 
182% compared with 2022, while new onshore wind capacity ad ded in North America and Europe in 
2023 dropped by 15.6% (1.5 GW) and 13.4% (2.2 GW), respectively. New installations in Canada 
increased by 71% last year, but US onshore wind installations went down to their lowest level since 
2014. The decline in Europe was primarily due to lower installations in Finland, Spain, Turkey and 
Sweden compared with the previous year. 
 
• Offshore wind: New offshore wind installations increased by 24% (2.1 GW) compared with 2022, which 
was mainly due to the recovery of the Chinese offshore wind market (25% YoY). Additionally, the 
Netherlands set a record with nearly 2 GW of new capacity commissioned in 2023.  
91 
 
India among top four power generating nations 
 
In June 2021, the Export-Import Bank of India (Exim Bank) announced that it has extended a line of credit (LOC) 
worth US$ 100 million to the Sri Lankan government for the purpose of funding projects in the solar energy sector 
and assuring that the country’s 70% power requirements are met by renewable energy sources by 2030. 
 
Power Generation has grown rapidly over the years 
 
The Union Budget of 2025-26 has allocated Rs. 1,500 crore (US$ 174.4 million) to the solar power (grid) segment, 
reinforcing India’s commitment to renewable energy transition. 
 
In the Union Budget 2022 -23, the government allocated Rs. 7,327 crore (US$ 885 million) for the solar power 
sector including grid, offgrid, and PM-KUSUM projects. 
 
Solar energy is the largest renewable energy source in India. Projects like the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar 
Mission are creating a positive environment among investors keen to make use of India’s potential. There are 
plans to set up four solar power plants of 1 GW each. As of January 31, 2025, India had 165.20 GW of renewable 
energy sources (RES) capacity (excluding large hydro). 
 
As of December 2024, India has a total installed capacity of 209.45 GW for renewable energy sources, including 
large hydropower. The breakdown is as follows: Wind power at 48.16 GW, solar power at 97.87 GW, biomass/co-
generation at 10.73 GW, small hydro po wer at 5.10 GW, waste to energy at 0.62 GW, and large hydro at 46.97 
GW. This diverse mix highlights India's significant strides in expanding renewable energy infrastructure for a 
more sustainable energy future. 
 
In India, approvals have been granted for 50 solar parks with a combined capacity of 37.49 GW. Additionally, 
there is a target of 30 GW for offshore wind energy by 2030, with identified potential sites.  

92 
 
 
Policy support and initiatives 
 
Union Budget 2025-26 
The 2025-26 Budget allocates Rs. 48,396 crore (US$ 4.36 billion) to the power sector, boosting rooftop solar 
funding by 80%, and dedicating Rs. 16,021 crore (US$ 1.86 billion) to modernizing the grid with smart meters 
and infrastructure upgrades. 
 
Tariff 
 
Solar tariffs in India have reduced from around Rs. 7.36/kWh (10 cents/kWh) in FY15 to Rs. 2.45/kWh (3.2 
cents/kWh) in July 2021. 
 
Boost to manufacturing 
 
• To create potential for domestic manufacturers and developers, the Government will auction 40 GW of 
renewable energy projects, including 30 GW solar and 10 GW wind, every year until 2028. 
• > 70% of equipment used for generation of wind power is manufactured in India.  
 
No environment clearance required for solar projects 
 
The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India, has clarified that solar PV 
(photovoltaic) power, solar thermal power projects, and solar parks will not require the environmental clearance 
which was mandatory under the provisions of Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) notification, 2006. 
 
  

93 
Rooftop solar 
 
In the Union Budget 2025-26, the government boosted its flagship rooftop solar initiative, PM Surya Ghar: Muft 
Bijli Yojana, by allocating Rs. 20,000 crore (US$ 2.33 billion) an 80% increase to fast -track the deployment of 
rooftop solar projects.  
 
To encourage rooftop solar (RTS) throughout the country, Ministry New and Renewable Energy has developed a 
National Portal wherein any residential consumer from any part of the country can apply for rooftop solar without 
waiting for Discom to finalize tender and empanel vendors. 
 
Since the launch on July 30, 2022, the total number of applications received on the national portal is for 117 MW 
solar capacity and the feasibility of more than 18 MW projects is granted.  
 
PLI Scheme 
 
In November 2021, the government announced future plans to increase the funding under the PLI scheme for 
domestic solar cells and module manufacturing to Rs. 24,000 crore (US$ 3.17 billion ) from the existing Rs. 4,500 
crore (US$ 594.68 million) to make India an exporting nation.  
 
Production Linked Incentive Scheme (Tranche II) on ‘National Programme on High Efficiency Solar PV

Functioning of our Windmills  
 
A WTG comprises a tower (or mast), a nacelle (which contains the essential mechanical and electrical parts) and 
rotor blades. The generation of electricity by a WTG is a result of the interplay between these developed and 
synchronised components.  
 
Each wind turbine has blades (generally made of reinforced glass fibre or other synthetic composite material), a 
casing (generally made of composite material) that includes and covers the gearbox and generator, a supporting 
tower and certain other secondar y support systems. The wind causes the blades to rotate, which in turn spins the 
rotor to which they are connected. The energy generated by this rotor is transmitted to a generator that produces 
electric current, transforming the force of the wind into ele ctrical power. The amount of power generated from 
wind is a function of the swept area of the rotor.  
 
The tower of the windmills is connected to the electrical collection system. The collection system feeds into a 
step-up substation, in which a power transformer converts the lower voltage from the collection system to the high 
voltage level of the local electricity transmission and distribution system (“Grid”).  
 
The aggregate installed capacity of windmills varies from project to project as it is largely driven by availability 
of wind potential land, the number and type of WEGs and interconnection to electricity transmission systems.  
 
Once the windmills are developed and become operational, Original Equipment Manufacturers ( OEMs) secure 
commissioning certificates from the respective state authorities . Upon obtaining the commissioning certificate, 
the windmills commence operations and start generating electricity.  
 
Subsequently, we enter into PPAs with power users and an Energy Wheeling Agreement for selling power to 
group captive and third -party customers. This involves obtaining SEB approval to transmit the generated power 
through the grid to purchasers under individual PPAs, ensuring electricity reaches the end consumers. 
 
For our green field projects, we procure our windmills from the third-party OEMs executes various aspects of the 
wind farm development, construction, and commissioning process, including wind data evaluation, wind resource 
mapping, identification of suitab le sites, technical planning, wind farm design, obtaining required approvals and 
other integrated services related to wind power.  
 
Presently, our WGs generally stand between 40  meters and 90 meters tall, with the generator ranging from 225 
KW to 2 MW in capacity, and a rotor diameter 5 times the diameter of the blades besides each other and 7 times 
diameter of blades at the back side i.e. next row.

PROPOSED DIVERSIFICATION INTO SOLAR POWER PROJECT  
 
The Company is in the process of exploring opportunities in the renewable energy sector and is considering an 
investment in setting up of 4 MW solar power plant in Karnataka State. This initiative is part of the Company’s 
strategy to diversify its business portfolio and contribute to sustainable energy generation. The project is currently 
under planning and evaluation stages, and the Company intends to undertake the development thro ugh internal 
accruals and/or proposed Rights Issue proceeds, subject to necessary approvals. 
 
This proposed project is currently in the preliminary planning stage . The solar power project is intended to 
contribute to long -term value creation by providing a stable source of revenue and enabling our Company to 
participate in India’s transition toward clean energy. This proposed diversification is aligned with our broader 
objective of exploring avenues that complement our existing lines of business and offer potential for sustainable 
growth. 
 
How a Solar Farm works  
 
Solar energy, an abundant and freely available resource, is harnessed in solar farms by converting sunlight into 
usable energy. This conversion is primarily achieved through photovoltaic (PV) technology, which is commonly 
used in large-scale solar power installations. 
 
Photovoltaic (PV) cells are interconnected and mounted on a frame called a solar module. These modules are then 
installed on racks and arranged in arrays within a solar park. The total number of modules depends on the intended 
installed capacity of the sol ar facility. When sunlight strikes the PV cells, it energizes the electrons in the 
semiconductor material, generating an electric current through what is known as the photovoltaic effect. The 
electricity produced at this stage is in the form of Direct Current (DC). This DC power is then routed to inverters, 
which convert it into Alternating Current (AC)—the standard form of electricity used for general consumption. 
 
99 
 
 
PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENTS 
 
The initial phase in the development of a solar power project involves conducting comprehensive preliminary 
assessments. These assessments are critical to identifying the most suitable location for the project and evaluating 
key factors that influence its overall feasibility. 
 
SITE SELECTION 
 
Selecting an appropriate site is fundamental to the success of a utility -scale solar project. The selection process 
typically includes the following considerations: 
a) The site must exhibit high solar irradiance, ensuring consistent exposure to sunlight throughout the day. 
b) It should be accessible for construction activities and support the installation of necessary infrastructure. 
c) Preferably, the terrain should be flat, free from dense vegetation or trees, and not located in flood -prone 
zones. 
d) The soil must be geotechnically suitable to support structural components and to minimize foundation -
related costs. 
e) Proximity to the power grid is essential, or at least there must be a feasible opportunity for grid 
connectivity. Alternatively, in remote areas, standalone systems with battery storage may be viable. 
f) The site should not be located near ecologically sensitive areas, heritage zones, or protected sites.  
 
FEASIBILITY STUDIES 
 
Feasibility studies are conducted to assess the commercial, technical, and environmental viability of the selected 
site. These typically include: 
a) Financial Evaluation: Involves a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether the project is economically 
sound. 
b) Technical Review: Assesses factors such as land topography, soil stability, and availability of electrical 
infrastructure. 
c) Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) : Identifies potential environmental risks and proposes 
measures to mitigate adverse effects on local biodiversity and ecosystems. 
 
DESIGN & ENGINEERING 
 
Following the preliminary evaluations, the next phase involves engineering design based on site -specific 
attributes. This includes the planning and specification of major components and technical parameters.  
 
COMPONENT SELECTION 
 
Key equipment such as photovoltaic modules, inverters, mounting systems, and trackers are selected based on 
project requirements, operational efficiency, and budget constraints. 
 

100 
SOLAR PANEL ORIENTATION & TILT 
 
The positioning and tilt of the solar panels are optimized to maximize energy generation. This is determined by 
analysing site conditions such as geographical latitude, climatic patterns, and shading elements.  
 
ELECTRICAL & STRUCTURAL DESIGN 
 
This involves drafting the electrical layout and plant sizing, including the design for grid integration. It also 
accounts for power quality aspects like harmonic distortion and power factor correction. Structural design includes 
consideration of environme ntal loads such as wind and snow, ensuring durability and compliance with safety 
standards. 
 
PERMITS & APPROVALS 
 
For the project to advance beyond the design stage, securing all necessary regulatory clearances and permits is 
essential. 
 
Grid Connectivity and Interconnection 
 
Approvals must be obtained for evacuation infrastructure and synchronization with the power grid. Compliance 
with utility regulations and technical specifications is mandatory. 
 
Financing & Procurement 
 
Arranging suitable financing is vital to ensure the project's timely implementation. Various funding mechanisms 
are available: 
 
Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) 
 
PPAs are legally binding contracts between the project developer and a power purchaser, often a utility or 
corporate buyer. These agreements secure long -term revenue through fixed tariff arrangements and enhance the 
project’s bankability. 
 
Bank Loans / Debt Financing 
 
Debt instruments are commonly used to finance project costs. However, lenders assess associated risks by 
reviewing the developer’s financial standing, project cash flows, and credit history. For new entrants without a 
track record, accessing substantial loans may be challenging. 
 
Equity Financing 
 
Equity is often used to bridge funding gaps not covered by debt. Investors may include promoters or external 
stakeholders who provide capital in exchange for ownership stakes. While equity investors assume greater risk, 
they are also entitled to future profits, making this a viable option for early-stage renewable energy projects. 
 
Project Finance 
 
This model involves creating a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), which independently undertakes the project and 
secures non-recourse loans. Loan repayments are made solely from project-generated revenues, thereby shielding 
the parent company’s balance sheet f rom potential liabilities. This structure simplifies risk allocation and 
facilitates higher leverage. 
 
Government Incentives & Grants 
 
Depending on the location, developers may qualify for various incentives such as subsidies, accelerated 
depreciation, rebates, or tax credits offered under regional or national renewable energy programs. These 
incentives can significantly reduce project development costs. 
 
101 
Quality Control & Inspections 
 
Post-construction, rigorous quality assurance and compliance inspections must be carried out before 
commissioning the solar project. 
 
System Performance Testing 
 
Performance tests are conducted to verify the system’s energy output and to ensure proper functioning of solar 
panels, inverters, and control systems. Key parameters like voltage, current, and efficiency are assessed.  
 
Safety Compliance 
 
Ensuring adherence to safety protocols during installation is imperative. This includes proper use of personal 
protective equipment (PPE), adherence to electrical safety standards, and safe construction practices.  
 
Final Inspections 
 
A comprehensive final inspection is undertaken by a certified professional to validate that the system is installed 
in accordance with applicable codes and regulations. Upon successful inspection, the system is formally 
commissioned and connected to the grid. 
 
Operation & Maintenance (O&M) 
 
Once operational, the solar power system requires ongoing maintenance to ensure sustained performance and 
optimal energy generation throughout its lifecycle. 
 
Monitoring System Performance 
 
Continuous monitoring is essential to track output efficiency and identify performance deviations. Advanced 
monitoring tools and data analytics help detect faults and recommend corrective actions in real -time. 
 
Preventive Maintenance 
 
Routine preventive maintenance helps avoid unplanned outages and prolongs equipment life. This includes 
inspections, electrical testing, system calibration, and cleaning of solar modules.  
 
Reactive Maintenance & Repairs 
 
Despite preventive efforts, unexpected issues may still arise. Remote monitoring systems facilitate early fault 
detection and enable rapid troubleshooting. A well-defined repair protocol and readily available replacement parts 
ensure minimal system downtime in case of failure.

Our captive consumers typically consist of large -scale power users with a high demand for reliable electricity, 
benefiting from additional and consistent sources of power. 
 
In addition, a portion of the electricity generated by our windmills is sold to State Electricity Board (SEB) 
BESCOM under long -term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), which generally have a duration of 20 years. 
These long-term PPAs offer us assured revenu e visibility and stability. Moreover, many of our agreements with 
SEBs also provide the flexibility to concurrently sell power to private consumers, further diversifying our revenue 
streams. 
 
The following is the revenue breakup on limited review unaudited  consolidated financial basis for the quarter 
ended June 30, 2025, and restated audited financials for years ended, March 31, 2025, and March 31, 2024, from

TARIFF 
 
The feed-in tariff for the wind energy in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka are determined by Tamil Nadu Electricity 
Regulatory Commission and Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission respectively. Tariffs under our wind 
PPAs in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka currentl y range from ₹3.40/kWh to ₹7.00/kWh (₹4.70 net). Our captive 
consumers generally pay us higher tariff rates than we receive from selling power to the SEB. 
 
OPERATIONS & MAINTENANCE 
 
In relation to our green field projects, the OEMs generally provide operation and maintenance services on our 
windmills for a particular period of time. In our brownfield projects, our group’s operation and maintenance team 
carries out the operation and maintenance of the windmills and uses third party services as and when required . 
 
CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM 
 
Under the Kyoto Protocol, to which India is a signatory, certain developed nations, categorized as "Annex I 
countries," have committed to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. To fulfil these binding commitments, 
Annex I countries can either reduce their emissions domestically or purchase Certified Emission Reduction units 
("CERs") from developing nations, referred to as "Annex II countries," through the carbon finance market. 
Emission reductions acquired through carbon finance can be applied toward mee ting greenhouse gas reduction 
obligations under the Kyoto Protocol or other regulated or voluntary emission reduction frameworks.  
 
We aim to generate income by recognizing CERs from our windmill projects, which are registered as Clean 
Development Mechanism ("CDM") projects with the CDM Executive Board under the United Nations’ carbon 
offset program. We continuously monitor the market and explore opportunities to sell these CERs effectively.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 
 
Our company has developed a secure and scalable IT infrastructure to support daily operations and ensure data 
protection. We utilize a mix of on -premises servers and cloud platforms, with Tally ERP 9, ZOHO, and project 
management tools like Microsoft Teams  and Flock integrated for efficient workflow. Enterprise -grade firewalls, 
IPS systems, and licensed antivirus solutions such as Symantec and Bitdefender protect our network and 
endpoints. Automated daily backups, both onsite and cloud -based, are maintained with regular disaster recovery 
testing. High -speed fibre internet with failover connections ensures minimal downtime. Google Workspace is 
used for email, collaboration, and secure document management. System performance and security logs are 
continuously monitored by our IT team. Physical servers and cloud stor age (AWS and Google Cloud) ensure 
scalability and reliability. Employees use updated desktops and laptops with SSDs, supported by biometric 
attendance and conferencing tools. This infrastructure enables secure, smooth, and efficient business operations. 
 
COMPETITION 
 
We operate in a competitive landscape and primarily compete with other independent power producers (IPPs) to 
secure power purchase agreements (PPAs) with private customers. 
 
Our key competitors include both domestic and international companies that may possess varying levels of 
financial, operational, marketing, and personnel resources as compared with us. Competition may arise across 
multiple areas, including the sourcing of wind energy projects, reputation and track record, relationships with 
government authorities, access to capital, control over project quality, access to project land, and efficiency and 
reliability in project development.  
 
We also face competition from both traditional and new renewable energy companies. Furthermore, we compete 
with these companies for a limited pool of skilled personnel with the industry knowledge and expertise required 
to sustain and grow our business. 
 
HEALTH AND SAFETY COMPLIANCE 
 
Our business operations inherently involve risks and hazards that could lead to damage or destruction of property, 
personal injury, business interruptions and potential legal liabilities. The safety and well -being of our workforce 
remain our top priority.  
 
To maintain a hazard -free work environment, we conduct continuous risk assessments allowing us to identify 
potential risks and implement effective mitigation measures. First aid facilities and medical support are readily 
available to address any injuries or health concerns that may arise during work hours.  
 
Additionally, our executives at all our sites look after the safety measures and wellbeing of the workers fostering 
open communication and encouraging active participation in safety -related discussions. These initiatives 
collectively reflect our commitment  to create a secure and healthy work environment while minimizing 
operational risks. 
 
ENVIRONMENT  
 
As a renewable energy company, we are committed towards clean energy transition and contributing our share to 
meet its Net zero target through our Renewable Energy Projects. We have registered some of our renewable energy 
projects with different international carbon programs, such as Clean Development Mechanism  (CDM).

Limited Review Report on Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results for the quarter ended June 30, 
2025 of Indowind Energy Limited pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 
 
 
  To the Board of Directors of Indowind Energy Limited 
 
 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited consolidated financial results ('the  Statement') of 
Indowind Energy Limited ('the Holding Company') and its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries 
together referred to as 'the group') for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, being submitted by the Holding 
Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations 2015 (the "Listing Regulations, 2015") as amended. 
 
 
2. The Statement is the responsibility of the  Holding Company's management and approved by the Holding 
Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles 
laid down in Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting' prescribed under Section 133 
of the Companies Act,2013 and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to 
express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
 
 
3. We conducted our review in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410, 'Review of 
interim Financial Information performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity', issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India. This Standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate 
assurance as to whether the Statement is free of material misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries 
of company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus provides less assurance than 
an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.  We also 
performed procedures in accordance with the circular issued by the SEBI under Regulation 33(8) of the Listing 
Regulations, to the extent applicable. 
 
 
Basis for Qualified Opinion 
 
1. We refer to the fact that the Holding Company has not recognized expected credit loss allowance on interest 
receivables of ₹  248.13 lakhs from TNEB Tirunelveli and BESCOM, which are credit impaired. This is not in 
compliance with Ind AS 109 on Financial Instruments, and results in an overstatement of trade receivables and 
the balance in Profit & Loss account will be lower by ₹ 248.13 lakhs. 
 
2. We refer to the fact that t he Holding Company has filed an arbitration claim amounting to ₹9,083.39 lakhs 
against Suzlon Group. Further, ₹1,066.24 lakhs paid to Suzlon Global Services Ltd. is accounted as advance 
without adequate audit evidence and not expensed. Further, ₹845.59 lakhs has been  recognised as 
compensation receivable from Suzlon Energy Ltd. without counterparty confirmation nor amortized under Ind 
AS 109. The remaining balance of the claim has not been recognized. Had the advance been expensed and the 
receivable appropriately amortized, the balance in Profit & Loss account under reserves and surplus would have 
been lower by ₹ 1,066.24 lakhs for the year and ₹845.59 lakhs cumulatively. The accounting treatment thus 
departs from the relevant Ind AS requirements and impacts the financial statements.

3. We refer to Rs.100 lakhs held by the Holding company as Bank Guarantee issued by Dena Bank, now Bank of 
Baroda in the year 2002.  The company is holding Ombudsman Order directing the Bank to honour the Bank 
Guarantee along with interest.  Company’s case to honour the dues is ongoing in the Hon’ble Bombay High 
Court under case No. 05/2007.  In view of the legal case, we are unable to comment on the realisability of the 
amount against the Bank Guarantee and its potential effect in the financial results. 
 
4. We refer to the fact that one of the wholly owned subsidiary M/s. Indeco Ventures Limited, wherein the Group 
has not considered the impairment of goodwill in the consolidated financial results pursuant to a demerger. We 
are unable to comment on the potential impairment  and its potential effects in the financial results , if any.
              
5. The Statement includes the results of the following entity: 
 
Name of the Entity Relationship 
Indowind Power Private Limited Subsidiary 
Ind Eco Ventures Limited Wholly owned Subsidiary 
 
6. Based on our review conducted as above, except for the effects of the matters described in paragraphs 1 
to 4 above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, 
prepared in accordance with applicable Ind AS and other recognised accounting practices and policies, has 
not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 
33 of the Listing Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any 
material misstatement. 
 
7. This Statement includes the interim financial information of Ind Eco Ventures Limited (Wholly owned 
Subsidiary) whose has not been reviewed/audited, whose interim financial information reflect total revenue 
of ₹ 75.58 lakhs, total net profit of ₹ 43.69 lakhs for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 as considered in the 
Statement.            
  
8. This Statement includes the interim financial information of Indowind Power Private Limited  
(Subsidiary) whose has not been review ed/audited, whose interim financial information reflect total 
revenue of ₹ 200.05 lakhs, total net profit of ₹ 57.72 Lakhs for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 as 
considered in the Statement.

3. We refer to Note 8.8 of the financial statements. The Holding Company has recognized H02 lakhs as 
recoverable from Bank of Baroda based on a legal claim pending since 2007 without confirmation or sufficient 
audit evidence, which is· not in compliance with Ind AS 37 and Ind AS 109. Had appropriate provision been 
made, the profit before tax would have been lower to that extent. 
2. We refer to Notes 8.8.1 and 8.14.1 of the financial statements. The Company has filed an arbitration 
claim amounting to ~9,083.39 lakhs against Suzlon Group. Further, H,066.24 lakhs paid to Suzlon Global 
Services Ltd. is accounted as advance without adequate audit evidence and not expensed. Further, ~845.59 
lakhs has been recognised as compensation receivable from Suzlon Energy Ltd. without counterparty 
confirmation or fair valuation under Ind AS 109. The remaining balance of the claim has not been recognized. 
Had the advance been expensed and the receivable appropriately fair valued, profit before tax would have 
been lower by U27.24 lakhs for the year and ~845.59 lakhs cumulatively. The accounting treatment thus 
departs from the relevant Ind AS requirements and impacts the financial statements. 
1. We refer to Note 8.10 of the financial statements. The Holding Company has not recognized expected 
credit loss allowance on interest receivables of~ 248.13 lakhs from TNEB Tirunelveli and BESCOM, which are 
credit impaired. This is not in compliance with Ind AS 109 on Financial Instruments, and results in an 
overstatement of trade receivables and profit for the year lower by ~248.13 lakhs. 
~ Our Independent Auditor's Report for the period ended March 31, 2025, included the below 
Basis for Qualified Opinion: 
~Audited Ind AS Consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended March 31,

4. The Holding company is the defendant in a legal case filed vide C.P.No.172 of 2011 by the Trustees of the 
Foreign Currency Bond Holders (FCCB) for winding up of the Holding Company before the Honourable High 
court of Madras. It is pertinent to note that the Honourable High Court of Madras has passed an order dated 
~ admittin? the wind'.ng u~ p~titi?n and also the Holding Co~pany is restrained from transferri~g, 
~~~ umbering or dealing with its immovable assets. The Holding Company has filed an appeal with 
e Divisi ·,;· ench of the Honourable High Court of Madras with the Prayer for order of Interim Stay of all 
p ~ dings in pursuance to the Judgment passed on 20.05.2020. 
3. The Holding Company's other non-current assets include balance amounting to ~ 102 lakhs excluding 
interest as per Ombudsman order recoverable from Bank of Baroda in respect of the bank guarantee issued by 
Dena bank (merged with Bank of Baroda) for advance payment by the Holding company to M/s. Cicon 
Environment Technology Ltd. The Holding Company has filed a suit bearing no.5 of 2007 and the matter is 
pending before Honourable High Court of Bombay, which was adjourned to place the matter for final 
arguments. In view of the uncertainty associated with the outcome of the case, the recognition of the claim as 
an asset is not in accordance of the provisions of Ind AS 37 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent 
Assets' and Ind AS 109 'Financial Instruments' and in the absence of such confirmation from the bank or · 
sufficient and appropriate alternate audit evidence, we are unable to comment on the adjustments if any, that 
may be required to the carrying value of the aforementioned balance in the accompanying statement. 
2. The Holding Company has paid and not recorded for the expenses of operations and maintenance to the 
tune of Rs. 739.00 lakhs to Suzlon Global Services Limited (SGSL) towards restoration and repairs and 
maintenance for breakdown of the wind turbines, based on which the relevant repairs have been already carried 
out and the machines are in running condition and the nature of payments made is clearly evident from the 
Memorandum of Settlement Agreement entered by the Holding Company on January 21, 2022 with Suzlon 
Energy Limited and Suzlon Global Services Limited. Further, the Holding Company has not recognized the 
provision to the tune of Rs. 547.02 lakhs payable to SGSL towards operations and maintenance charges 
pertaining to Sep 2021 to March 2022, Oct 2022 to March 2024 where the holding company has present 
obligation and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation which is not 
in accordance with the provisions of Ind AS 37 as the holding company and Suzlon have settled the ongoing 
dispute in generation shortfall for the 15-MW project funded by EXIM Bank & IREDA. Accordingly, had the 
recognition of above said expenses, the profit before exceptional items and tax for the year ended March 31, 
2024 would have been lower by ~ 268.19 lakhs. Further, Suzlon has committed to honour the shortfall in 
generation to the extent of Rs 3600 lakhs by adjusting against supply of a technically & financially viable project 
of 12.6 MW and the holding company will make 0 & M dues. Since the full settlement implementation action is 
not yet over/ in progress, pending bank settlement, the holding company has not provided for loss allowance 
for expected credit losses for the said amount. Hence, we are unable to comment on the impact of the same 
on the profit for the year ended March 31, 2024. 
1. The Holding Company has not provided loss allowance for expected credit losses with respect to the Interest 
recoverable from TNEB Tirunelveli and BESCOM to the tune of ~ 248.13 lakhs. The financial asset is credit 
impaired and accordingly the loss allowance for expected credit losses is to be recognised. Accordingly, had 
the recognition of loss allowance for expected credit losses been made in line with the provisions of Ind AS 109 
'Financial instruments' in the financial results, the profit before exceptional items and tax for the year ended 
March 31,2024 would have been lower by~ 248.13 lakhs.

The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in 
cash and cash equivalents. The Company has identified 1 month as its operating cycle. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities. 
All other liabilities are classified as non-current. 
A liability is current when: 
• It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle. 
• It is held primarily for the purpose of trading. 
• It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or 
• There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at "least twelve months 
after the reporting period. 
All other assets are classified as non-current. 
An asset is treated as current when it is: 
• Expected to be realized or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle. 
• Held primarily for the purpose of trading.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and 
unused tax losses can be utilised. Where there is deferred tax assets arising from carry forward of 
unused tax losses and unused tax created, they are recognised to the extent of deferred tax liability. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. 
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date. 
Deferred Tax 
Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss 
(either in other comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in correlation to 
the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates 
positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are 
subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. 
Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or 
paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that 
are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the countries where the Company 
operates and generates taxable income.

Bank borrowings are generally considered to be financing activities. However, where bank overdrafts 
which are repayable on demand form an integral part of an entity's cash management, bank overdrafts 
are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of Cash flow statement. 
Cash flows are presented using indirect method, whereby profit / (loss) before tax is adjusted for the 
effects of transactions of non-cash nature and any deferrals or accruals of past or future cash receipts or 
payments.

Revenue expenses and revenue receipts incurred in connection with project implementation in so far as 
such expense relate to the period prior to the commencement of commercial production are treated as 
part of project cost and capitalised. 
Property, plant and equipment and capital work in progress are stated at cost, net of accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of 
the plant and equipment and borrowing costs of a qualifying asset, if the recognition criteria are met. 
When significant parts of plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Company 
depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives. All other repair and maintenance costs 
are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. 
Presentation 
Under the previous GAAP (Indian GAAP), property, plant and equipment were carried in the balance 
sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation. The Company has elected to consider the previous GAAP 
carrying amount of the Plant and Equipment as the deemed cost as at the date of transition, viz.,1 April

The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are 
reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. 
Depreciation for PPE on additions is calculated on pro-rata basis from the date of such additions. For 
deletion/disposals, the depreciation is calculated on pro-rata basis up to the date on which such assets 
have been discarded/ sold. Additions to fixed assets, costing Rs. 5,000 each or less are fully depreciated 
retaining its residual value. 
Depreciation is provided on straight line method, over the useful lives specified in Schedule II to the 
Companies Act, 2013. 
Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life on a 
Straight -line method. The depreciable amount for assets is the cost of an asset or other amount 
substituted for cost, less 5% being its residual value. 
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment 
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of property, plant and equipment are measured as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized 
in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognized. 
Derecognition 
Machinery spares that can be issued only in connection with an item of fixed assets and their issue is 
expected to be irregular are capitalised. Replacement of such spares is charged to revenue. Other spares 
are charged as revenue expenditure as and when consumed. 
The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying 
amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow 
to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of repairs and maintenance are 
recognised in the statement of profit and loss as incurred.

The Cornpang operates a defined benefit gratuity plan in India, which requires contributions to be made 
. ~ ~f. f ely administered fund. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is 
e mi ing the projected unit credit method. 
Defined benefit plans 
Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund is a defined contribution scheme. The Company has no 
obligation, other than the contribution payable to the provident fund and superannuation fund. The 
Company recognizes the contribution payable to the provident fund scheme as an expense, when an 
employee renders the related service. If the contribution payable to the scheme for service received 
before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is 
recognized as a liability after deducting the contribution already paid. If the contribution already paid 
exceeds the contribution due for services received before the balance sheet date, then excess is 
recognized as an asset to the extent that the pre-payment will lead to, for example, a reduction in future 
payment or a cash refund. 
Defined contribution plans 
A liability is recognised for short-term employee benefit in the period the related service is rendered at 
the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service. 
Short-term Employee Benefits 
3.7 Employee Benefits (Ind AS 19) 
Dividend income is recognized when the company's right to receive dividend is established by the 
reporting date. Income from sale of CER (Carbon Credits) is accounted for based on eligibility criteria. 
Other Income 
Interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts 
the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a 
shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or to the 
amortised cost of a financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Company estimates 
the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for 
example, prepayment, extension, .call and similar options) but does not consider the expected credit 
losses.

assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation. 
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, production of a qualifying 
asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset which takes substantial period of time to get ready 
for its intended use. The Company determines the amount of borrowing cost eligible for capitalisation by 
applying capitalisation rate to the expenditure incurred on such cost. The capitalisation rate is 
determined based on the weighted average rate of borrowing cost applicable to the borrowings of the 
Company which are outstanding during the period, other than borrowings made specifically towards 
purchase of the qualifying asset. The amount of borrowing cost that the Company capitalises during the 
period does not exceed the amount of borrowing cost incurred during that period. All other borrowings 
costs are expensed in the period in which they occur . 
Borrowing cost include interest computed using Effective Interest Rate method, amortisation of ancillary 
costs incurred and exchange differences from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are 
regarded as an adjustment to the interest cost. 
3.9 Borrowing cost (Ind AS 23) 
c) Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are 
translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items 
measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when 
the fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at 
fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item 
(i.e., translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss 
are also recognised in OCI or profit or loss, respectively). 
b) Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional 
currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on settlement or 
translation of monetary items are recognised in profit or loss. 
a) Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Company at the functional 
currency spot rates at the date at which the transaction first qualifies for recognition. However, for 
practical reasons, the Company uses an average rate, if the average approximates the actual rate at the 
date of the transaction. 
3.8 Foreign Currency Transaction (Ind AS 21) 
Liabilities recognised in respect of other long-term employee benefits are measured at the present value 
of the estimated future cash outflows expected to be made by the Company in respect of services 
provided by the employees up to the reporting date. Liability for un-availed leave considered to be long­ 
term is carried based on an actuarial valuation carried out at the end of each financial year.

liabilities only when converted into demand. 
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be 
confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the 
control of the company or a present obligation that is not recognized because it is not probable that an 
outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. Contingent liability also arises in extremely 
rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognized because it cannot be measured reliably. 
Contingent liabilities are disclosed separately . 
Contingent Liabilities 
Necessary provision for doubtful debts, claims, etc., are made if the realization of money is doubtful in 
the judgement of the management. 
Provisions are discounted if the effect of the time value of money is material, using pre-tax rates that 
reflect the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, an increase in the provisions due to 
the passage of time is recognised as finance cost. These provisions are reviewed at each Balance Sheet 
date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. 
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result 
of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be 
required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
Provisions

Diluted EPS is computed by dividing the net profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity 
shares considered for deriving basic EPS and also weighted average number of equity shares that could 
have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. Dilutive potential equity shares 
are deemed converted as of the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date. Dilutive potential 
equity shares are determined independently for each period presented. The number of equity shares 
and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted for bonus shares, as appropriate. 
The basic earnings per share are computed by dividing the net profit for the period attributable to equity 
shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period.

nation-wide lockdown was lifted by the Government of India, but regional lockdowns continue to be 
implemented in areas with significant number of COVID-19 cases. Although, the Company witnessed 
significant improvement in its operations during the second half of the year, the Company remains 
watchful of the potential impact of COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the current "second wave", on 
resuming normal business operations on a continuing basis. Accordingly, the Company has assessed the 
impact of this pandemic on its business operations and has considered all relevant internal and external 
information available up to the date of approval of these Consolidated financial statements, to determine 
the impact on the Company's revenue from operations and estimation of sales related expenses over the 
foreseeable future and the recoverability and carrying value of certain assets such as property, plant and 
equipment, investments, inventories, trade receivables, deferred tax assets and input tax credit 
receivables. The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the overall economic environment being uncertain 
may affect the underlying assumptions and estimates used to prepare Company's financial results, which 
may differ from impact considered at the date of approval of these financials statements. The Company 
continues its business activities, in line with the guidelines issued by the Government authorities, take 
steps to strengthen its position of liquidity. As the situation is unprecedented, the Company is closely 
monitoring the situation as it evolves in the future. 
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits with banks. Cash equivalents are short-term 
balances with original maturity of less than 3 months, highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible into cash, which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. 
4. Cash and cash equivalents 
Where an inflow of economic benefits is probable, the Company discloses a brief description of the 
nature of the contingent assets at the end of the reporting period, and, where practicable, an estimate 
of their financial effect. Contingent assets are disclosed but not recognised in the Consolidated financial 
statements.

There are no carrying amounts of the Company's foreign currency denominated monetary assets and 
monetary liabilities at the end of the reporting period. 
The Company undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to 
exchange rate fluctuations arise. The Company actively manages its currency rate exposures through a 
centralised treasury division and uses natural hedging principles to mitigate the risks from such 
exposures. The use of derivative instruments, if any, is subject to limits and regular monitoring by 
appropriate levels of management. 
Foreign currency risk management 
Market risk is the risk of any loss in future earnings, in realizable fair values or in future cash flows that 
may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument. The Company's activities expose it 
primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The 
Company actively manages its currency and interest rate exposures through its finance division and uses 
derivative instruments such as forward contracts and currency swaps, wherever required, to mitigate the 
risks from such exposures. The use of derivative instruments is subject to limits and regular monitoring 
by appropriate levels of management. 
Market risk 
financial instruments and forward contracts to hedge risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is 
governed by the Company's policies approved by the board of directors, which provide written principles 
on foreign exchange risk, the use of financial derivatives, and the investment of excess liquidity. The 
Company does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, 
for speculative purposes.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
180 
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of  
changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price 
risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits and derivative financial 
instruments. 
 
Market Risk 
 
Market risk is the risk of any loss in future earnings, in realizable fair values or in future cash flows that may result 
from a change in the price of a financial instrument. Our Company's activities expose it primarily to the financial 
risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Our Company actively manages its currency 
and interest rate exposures through its finance division and uses derivative instruments such as forward contracts 
and currency swaps, wherever required, to mit igate the risks from such exposures. The use of derivative 
instruments is subject to limits and regular monitoring by appropriate levels of management . 
 
Foreign currency risk 
 
Our Company undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to exchange 
rate fluctuations arise. Our Company actively manages its currency rate exposures through a centralised treasury 
division and uses natural hedging principles to mitigate the risks from such exposures. The use of derivative 
instruments, if any, is subject to limits and regular monitoring by appropriate levels of management. There are no 
carrying amounts of our Company's foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the 
end of the reporting period. 
 
Interest rate risk 
 
Our Company is exposed to interest rate risk because it borrows funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. 
The risk is managed by our Company by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate 
borrowings and by the use of interest rate swap contracts. Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with 
interest rate views and defined risk appetite, ensuring the most cost-effective hedging strategies are applied. 
Further, in appropriate cases, our Company also effects changes in the borrowing arrangements to convert floating 
interest rates to fixed interest rates. 
 
Credit risk 
 
Credit risk arises when a customer or counterparty does not meet its obligations under a customer contract or 
financial instrument, leading to a financial loss. Our Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities 
primarily trade receivables, including deposits with banks Our Company has no significant concentration of credit 
risk with any counterparty. 
 
Liquidity risk 
 
Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Company cannot meet its financial obligations. The objective of liquidity 
risk management is to maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements. 
Our Company invests its surplus funds in bank fixed deposit, which carry minimal mark to market risks. Our 
Company also constantly monitors funding options available in the debt and capital markets with a view to 
maintaining financial flexibility.

i. Indowind Energy Limited vs. Wipro Finance Private Limited and Another – O.S. 7880 of 2010  
 
Our Company filed an original suit against Wipro Finance Private Limited (" Wipro") bearing number 
7880 of 2010 (originally filed as C.S. No. 588 of 2008 on the file of the Hon’ble High Court, Madras) 
dated October 6, 2008, before the Hon’ble III Fast Track Court, Chennai. Our Company entered into a 
contract dated May 20, 2006, with Wipro for the purchase of spares for a total purchase consideration of 
₹ 2,50,00,000 to ensure the uninterrupted operations of its wind energy generators situated in Tamil 
Nadu. Karnataka Breweries & Distilleries Private Limited paid ₹ 2,00,00,000 out of the  total 
consideration on behalf of our Company by way of a pay order dated June 29, 2006 bearing number 
144553. Further, our Company made a payment of ₹ 25,00,000 by way of a demand draft bearing number 
D.D. 627809. Our Company also conveyed its willingness to pay the outstanding amount of ₹25,00,000 
towards the completion of the total purchase consideration. However, Wipro failed to deliver the list of 
materials, invoice, delive ry challans, and the letter of authority to physically inspect the goods which 
formed an essential part of the completion of the contract and business operations of our Company. This 
led to huge losses incurred by our Company. As a result, our Company, through a legal notice dated July 
4, 2007, expressed their intention to terminate the purchase and demanded part payments made within a 
period of seven (7) days from receipt of the notice.  
 
Our Company and Wipro entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (" MoU") dated November 15, 
2009, through which Wipro acknowledged the receipt of the part payment of ₹2,25,00,000 made and 
agreed to make the delivery of the goods in a good condition and permitted our Company to physically 
examine the goods stored. Upon verification, our Company found that the spares were not in a good 
condition. Therefore, our Company fi led this original suit claiming a compensation to the tune of 
₹4,03,87,500 together with interest at 18% p.a. till realization.  
 
In view of lack of pecuniary jurisdiction to grant the amended relief the Hon’ble High Court has directed 
the Plaintiff to present the plaint before the competent Court. 
 
ii. Indowind Energy Limited vs. Dena Bank - S.S. 1614 of 2007 
 
Our Company filed this summary suit bearing number 1614 of 2007 which got converted to bearing no. 
COMS/5/2007 before the Hon’ble High Court of Bombay against Dena Bank (now known as Bank of 
Baroda) ("Dena Bank") for recovery of their dues valued at ₹1,51,64,110. Our Company entered into a 
contract with Cicon Environment Technologies Limited ("Cicon") to avail their services as the technical 
consultants to the Company for a consideration of ₹100 Lakhs. As per the terms of the contract, the 
repayment of the consideration was secured by Cicon by providing a bank guarantee from Dena Bank 
in case they fail to render the services as per the terms of the said contract to our Company. As per the 
184 
terms, upon failure of Cicon to deliver the required services, our Company invoked the bank guarantee 
bearing number MRN/RCK/CICON/182/03-04 dated May 26, 2003 ("Bank Guarantee") which was to 
remain in force till June 20, 2004, vide their letter dated June 17, 2004. Dena Bank falsely claimed the 
non-validity of the Bank Guarantee. Further, our Company vide its letter dated June 19, 2004, called 
upon Dena Bank to produce a copy o f the Bank Guarantee to which Dena Bank then claimed that the 
same was allegedly cancelled by our Company. Dena Bank neither paid the said amount of ₹100 Lakhs 
nor accepted their liability to pay. Our Company filed a complaint with the Banking Ombudsman 
("Ombudsman"), and the award was granted in favour of our Company. Thereafter, Dena Bank filed a 
review application with the review authority which was rejected. In view of the above, our Company has 
prayed before this Hon’ble Court that Dena Bank be ordered to pay a  sum of ₹1,51,64,110 with further 
interest at 18% p.a. from the date of filing of this summary suit till payment of the amount. The Hon’ble 
High Court of Bombay in its order dated January 24, 2024, have transferred the matter to Bombay City 
Civil Court as the valuation of the suit was below the pecuniary jurisdiction of Hon’ble High Court of 
Bombay. Matter is currently pending for final arguments.

Limited- Suit no. 1104 of 2004

and Soprano Holdings Company Private Limited (" Soprano") (collectively, "Defendants") before the 
Hon’ble High Court of Bombay claiming a total amount of ₹7,14,54,590.82 from the Defendants. Our 
Company entered into an operation and maintenance contract with Milton, for operating and maintaining 
windmills in various villages in Karnataka. Pursuant to the said contract, Milton requested our Company 
to grant the Soprano financial assistance amounting to ₹5,65,00,000 at an interest of 20% p.a., to be 
repaid by them over a period of 9 years and 9 months. Subsequently, a joint agreement dated April 24, 
1998 ("Joint Agreement"), was entered between them. However, pursuant to the Joint Agreement, the 
Milton failed to pay the rent to our Company. Hence, the Defendants are jointly and severally liable to 
pay our Company an amount of ₹5,65,00,000, which currently amounts to a fina l amount of 
₹7,14,54,590.82 inclusive of the interest.  
 
The matter was adjourned ‘sine die’ in 2014 as the Advocate for Milton submitted an Affidavit showing 
that the company is before the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (“BIFR”). The matter

Minimum Subscription 
 
Our Promoters and Promoter Group have undertaken to subscribe to the full extent of their Rights Entitlements 
and not renounce their Rights Entitlements (except to the extent of renunciation within the Promoter Group) and 
may subscribe for part of unsubscribed portion of rights equity shares over and above their rights entitlements, 
subject to compliance with the minimum public shareholding requirements under the SCRR and the SEBI Listing 
Regulations. Further, any unsubscribed portion thereafter shall be subscribed by the Underwriter to the extent of 
₹2,000.10 Lakhs for achieving minimum subscription. 
 
Regulation 86(1) of the SEBI ICDR Regulations mandates that the Company must receive a minimum 
subscription of at least 90% of the Issue. It further states that the minimum subscription criteria shall not be 
applicable if the object of the issue involves financing other than financing of capital expenditure for a project 
and the promoters and the promoter group undertake to subscribe fully to their portion of rights entitlement and 
do not renounce their rights except to the extent of renunciation within the promoter group. 
 
A major part of the Net Proceeds will be used to set up 4 MW solar power plant in Karnataka State, which is 
financing of capital expenditure for a project. The minimum subscript ion criteria (of at least 90% of the Issue) 
will, therefore, apply to this Issue. 
 
  
225 
Regulation 86(2) of the SEBI ICDR Regulations states that in the event of non-receipt of minimum subscription, 
all application monies shall be refunded to the applicants not later than four days from closure of the issue. Since 
unsubscribed portion shall b e subscribed by the Promoter and Promoter group over and above their rights 
entitlements and the Underwriter has underwritten to the extent of ₹2000.10 Lakhs for achieving minimum 
subscription, no money shall be refunded. 
 
 
Filing 
 
SEBI vide the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) (Fourth 
Amendment) Regulations, 2020 has amended Regulation 3(b) of the SEBI ICDR Regulations as per which the 
threshold for filing of the draft letter of offer with SEBI for rights issues has been increased. The threshold of the 
rights issue size under Regulation 3 (b) of the SEBI ICDR Regulations has been increased from Rupees one 
thousand lakhs to Rupees five thousand lakhs. Since the size of this Issue fa lls below this threshold, the Draft 
Letter of Offer was filed with BSE Limited and National Stock Exchange of India Limited and not with SEBI. 
However, the Letter of Offer will be submitted with SEBI for information and dissemination and will be filed 
with the Stock Exchanges.

RESTRICTIONS ON FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF INDIAN SECURITIES  
 
Foreign investment in Indian securities is regulated through the Consolidated FDI Policy and FEMA. The FDI 
Policy prescribes the limits and conditions subject to which foreign investment can be made in different sectors 
of the Indian economy and FEMA regulates the precise manner in which such investment may be made. 
 
The government bodies responsible for granting foreign investment approvals are the concerned 
ministries/departments of the Government of India and the RBI. Pursuant to the press release dated May 24, 2017, 
the Union Cabinet phased out the FIPB and it was replaced by the Foreign Investment Facilitation Portal (FIFP) 
to speed up the FDI inflow and to increase the transparency in the FDI approvals in the country. The DIPP issued 
the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Processing FDI Proposals on June 29, 2 017 (the "SOP"). The SOP 
provides a list of the competent authorities to grant approvals for foreign investment for sectors/activities 
requiring Government approval. For sectors or activities that are currently under the automatic route, but which 
required Government a pproval earlier as per the extant policy during the relevant period, the concerned 
Administrative Ministry/Department shall act as the competent authority (the " Competent Authority") for the 
grant of post facto approval for foreign investment. In circumstances where there is a doubt as to which department 
shall act as the Competent Authority, the DIPP will identify the Competent Authority.  
 
The Government of India, from time to time, has made policy pronouncements on Foreign Direct Investment 
("FDI") through press notes and press releases. The DIPP  has issued a consolidated FDI Policy DPIIT File 
Number 5(2)/2020 -FDI Policy Dated the October 15, 2020 ("FDI Policy 2020 "), which consolidates and 
supersedes all previous press notes, press releases and clarifications on FDI policy issued by the DIPP that were 
in force till that date. The Government of India proposes to update the consolidated circu lar on FDI policy once 
every year and therefore, the FDI Policy 2020 will be valid until the DIPP issues an updated circular.  
 
Under the FDI Policy, unless specifically restricted, foreign investment is freely permitted in all sectors of the 
Indian economy up to 100% without any prior approvals, however the foreign investor must follow certain 
prescribed procedures for making such  investment. Accordingly, the process for foreign direct investment 
("FDI") and approval from the Government of India will now be handled by the FIFP.  
 
The transfer of shares between an Indian resident and a non -resident does not need prior approval of the RBI, 
provided that (i) the activities of the investee company falls under the automatic route as provided in the FDI 
Policy and FEMA, and the transfer does not attract the provisions of the SEBI Takeover Regulations; (ii) the non- 
resident shareholding is within the sectoral limits under the FDI Policy; and (iii) the pricing is in accordance with 
the guidelines prescribed by SEBI and RBI. 
 
As per the extant policy of the Government of India, erstwhile OCBs cannot participate in this Issue. OCBs or 
Overseas Corporate Bodies have been de -recognized as a class of investor entity in India with effect from 
September 16, 2003. 
 
Overseas Corporate Body means a company, partnership firm, society and other corporate body owned directly 
or indirectly to the extent of at least sixty per cent by Non- Resident Indians and includes overseas trust in which 
not less than sixty percent beneficial interest is held by Non-resident Indians directly or indirectly but irrevocably, 
which was in existence as on September 16, 2003, and was eligible to undertake transactions pursuant to the 
general permission granted under FEMA. Any investment made i n India by such entities will be treated as 
investments by incorporated non-resident entities, i.e. a foreign company. 
 
The Issue, if renounced by our shareholders, may include offers within India, to Indian institutional, non - 
institutional and retail investors in offshore transactions as defined in, and made in reliance upon exemptions from 
the registration requirements u nder the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " U.S. Securities 
Act"), including the exemption under Regulation S ("Regulation S") of the U.S. Securities Act. 
 
The above information is given for the benefit of the Applicants / Investors. Our Company and the Lead Manager 
are not liable for any amendments or modification or changes in applicable laws or regulations, which may occur 
after the date of this Letter of Offer. Investors are advised to make their independent investigations and ensure
