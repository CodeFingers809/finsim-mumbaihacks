Subject: Intimation regarding the postponement of the Board Meeting scheduled for the adoption 
of Unaudited Financial (Standalone and Consolidated) Results for the quarter and half-year ended 
30th September, 2025. 
Dear Sir/Madam, 
This is further to our intimation dated November 13, 2025 regarding the scheduled meeting of the 
Board of Directors of the Company to, inter alia, consider and approve the Unaudited Financial 
(Standalone and Consolidated) Results for the quarter and half-year ended 30th September, 2025. 
Pursuant to Regulation 30 read with Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015, we hereby inform you that the said meeting of the Board of 
Directors, which was scheduled to be held on November 14, 2025, has been postponed. 
Reason for Postponement: 
The postponement is necessitated because the Audit Committee (AC), which was scheduled to review 
and recommend the results, could not adopt the Unaudited Financial (Standalone and Consolidated) 
Results for the quarter and half-year ended 30th September, 2025, due to the want of additional 
information and clarification required from the Management pertaining to certain line items. 
Consequently, both the Audit Committee Meeting and the subsequent Board of Directors Meeting 
stand postponed. 
The Company is actively working to provide the necessary inputs and clarification to the Audit 
Committee at the earliest. We assure the Exchange that the revised date of the Audit Committee 
Meeting and the Board Meeting to consider the Financial Results will be communicated to you 
promptly, in compliance with the SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015. 
We regret the inconvenience caused. 
Kindly take the above intimation on record. 
Thanking you, 
Yours faithfully, 
 
For Indrayani Biotech Limited 
 
 
Swaminathan Govindarajan 
Whole-time Director
