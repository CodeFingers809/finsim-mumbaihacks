Independent Auditor’s Review Report on the Quarterly and Year to Date Unaudited Standalone Financial 
Results of the Company pursuant to the Regulation 33 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations 2015, as amended
To
The Board of Directors
Everest Kanto Cylinder Limited
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Unaudited Standalone Financial Results of Everest 
Kanto Cylinder Limited (“the Company"), for the quarter and half-year ended 30 September 2025 (“the 
Statement”), attached herewith, being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 
33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (the 
“Listing Regulations”).
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company’s Management and approved by the Company’s 
Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid 
down in the Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting” (“Ind AS 34"), prescribed under 
Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with the presentation and disclosure requirements of 
Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based 
on our review.
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 
2410 ‘Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity’, issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). A review of interim financial information consists of 
making inquiries, primarily of the Company’s personnel responsible for financial and accounting matters and 
applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit 
conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 
2013 and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant 
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
4. Based on our review conducted as stated in paragraph 3 above, nothing has come to our attention that 
causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed 
in terms of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that 
it contains any material misstatement.

Independent Auditor’s Review Report on the Quarterly and Year to Date Unaudited Consolidated 
Financial Results of the Company pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015, as amended
To
The Board of Directors
Everest Kanto Cylinder Limited
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results (“the 
Statement”), of Everest Kanto Cylinder Limited (“the Holding Company”) and its subsidiaries (the 
Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”), (refer Annexure 1 for the list 
of subsidiaries included in the Statement) for the quarter and half-year ended 30 September 2025 (the 
“Statement”) attached herewith, being submitted by the Holding Company pursuant to the requirement of 
Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as 
amended (the “Listing Regulations”).
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Holding Company’s Management and approved by the 
Holding Company’s Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting" (“Ind 
AS 34”), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with relevant rules issued 
thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with the 
presentation and disclosure requirements of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. Our responsibility 
is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review.
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements 
(SRE) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity”, 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). A review of interim financial information 
consists of making inquiries, primarily of Holding Company’s personnel responsible for financial and 
accounting matters and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in 
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) 
of the Companies Act, 2013 and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would 
become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express 
an audit opinion.
We also performed procedures in accordance with the circular issued by the SEBI under Regulation 33(8) 
of Listing Regulations, to the extent applicable.
4. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above and based on 
the consideration of the review report of the other auditor referred to in paragraph 5 below, nothing has 
come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance 
with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standard 
and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to 
be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be 
disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement

5. We did not review the interim financial results of the 6 subsidiaries included in the unaudited consolidated 
financial results, whose interim financial results, without giving effects to elimination of intra-group 
transaction reflect total assets of Rs. 133,020 lakhs as of 30 September 2025 and total revenues of Rs. 
12,744 lakhs, total net profit after tax of Rs. 1,036 lakhs and total comprehensive income of Rs. 2,916 
lakhs for the quarter ended 30 September 2025 and total revenue of Rs. 28,252 lakhs, total net profit after 
tax of Rs. 3,666 lakhs, total comprehensive income of Rs. 6,023 lakhs and net cash outflows of Rs. 4,844 
lakhs for the six months ended 30 September 2025, as considered in the Statement. These interim 
financial results have been reviewed by the other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us by 
the Management and our conclusion on the Statement, in so far as it relates to the amounts and 
disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries is based solely on the reports of the other auditors 
and the procedures performed by us as stated in paragraph 3 above.
Further of the above 3 subsidiaries, located outside India, interim financial results have been prepared in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in their respective countries and which have 
been reviewed by other auditors under International Standards on Review Engagement applicable in their 
respective countries. The Holding Company's management has converted the financial results of such 
subsidiaries from accounting principles generally accepted in their respective countries to accounting 
principles generally accepted in India. We have reviewed these conversion adjustments made by the 
Holding Company's management. Our conclusion, in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures 
included in respect of these subsidiaries is based on the review reports of other auditors and the 
conversion adjustments prepared by the management of the Holding Company and reviewed by us.
Our conclusion on the Statement is not modified in respect of the above matters with respect to our 
reliance on the work done by and the reports of the other auditors.
6. The Statement includes the interim financial results of 3 subsidiaries, which have not been reviewed by 
their auditors, whose interim financial results, without giving effects to elimination of intra-group transaction 
reflect total assets of Rs. 1,986 lakhs as of 30 September 2025 and total revenues of Rs. 928 lakhs, total 
net loss after tax of Rs. 37 lakhs and total comprehensive loss of Rs. 71 lakhs for the quarter ended 30

of these subsidiaries is based on such unreviewed interim financial results. According to the information 
and explanations given to us by the management, these interim financial results are not material to the 
Group.

on the financial results certified by the Board of Directors.
