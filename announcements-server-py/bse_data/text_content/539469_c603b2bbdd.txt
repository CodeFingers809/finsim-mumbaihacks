accompanying Notice: 
ITEM NO. 3: Alteration of the Memorandum of Association (MOA) 
 
In order to provide greater financial flexibility and optimize the Company's investment strategies , the Board of 
Directors has proposed an amendment to the Memorandum of Association (MOA), This alteration pertains to the 
inclusion of a new point under the "Objects incidental or ancillary business" clause, which will enable the Company to 
make investments of its additional available or short-term free funds in various securities and mutual funds, subject to 
applicable laws and regulations. 
 
The proposed alteration involves adding the following new point under the “Objects incidental or ancillary business” 
clause of the MOA: 
 
"To make investments of the additional available funds or short -term free funds of the Company in all kinds of 
securities of companies, liquid funds, and mutual funds, subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations , to 
optimize the utilization of idle funds and generate additional revenue." 
 
This alteration is intended to allow the Company to invest its idle or unutilized funds in financial instruments such as 
mutual funds, liquid funds, and all kind of securities. These investments will provide the Company with an additional 
stream of revenue, enhancing its financial portfolio and ensuring the optimal use of available resources 
 
 
The Board of Directors believes that enabling such investments will improve financial s tability and provide additional 
opportunities for growth. The Board has approved the alteration to the MOA, which will now be placed before the 
shareholders for their approval at the forthcoming EOGM.

or interested, financially or otherwise, in the resolution, except to the extent of their shareholding in the Company, if
