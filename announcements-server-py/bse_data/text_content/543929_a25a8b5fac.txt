We believe in maintaining transparency with our investors and your engagement is a vital part of this process. 
Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that some statements made during this call may be forward 
looking and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ significantly from what is expressed or 
implied. For a comprehensive understanding, please refer to company's filings with stock exchanges and other 
public disclosures. 
 
Joining us today from our senior management team are Mr. Gulzeb Ahmed, who is the Chief Financial Officer; 
Mr. Aman Kaushik, Senior Associate Finance along with other members of our leadership team. The second 
quarter of FY26 has been a period of continued progress for the company. We have focused on strengthening 
operational efficiency, enhancing product quality and strategically expanding our market reach. These efforts 
have enabled us to navigate global challenges while maintaining our growth trajectory. 
 
I would now like to invite our CFO, Mr. Gulzeb Ahmed , to share a detailed overview of our financial 
performance, operational highlights and company's strategic outlook for the future. Over to you, Gulzeb Ji. 
 
Gulzeb Ahmed 
 
Thank you, Nikhil. A very wonderful afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Gulzeb Ahmed, CFO of HMA Agro 
Industries Limited. Today, we are making this conference call for the earning of half year for FY2526 and Q2 
results. It is my pleasure to present results that marked the strongest quarter and half year in our company 
history. This achievement reflects robust demand, improved operational efficiency and disciplined financial 
management. I would like to give you a brief number about our performance. First, I would like to understand 
our standalone financial performance. 
 
If we talk about the Q2 FY2526, we have created a record and this is our highest revenue we have ever made. 
In this quarter, we have achieved INR 21,491.68 million of revenue, whereas the last quarter, it was INR 13,666 
million. It is almost double what we have generated in this quarter. The total income we generated in this 
quarter is INR 21,849.52 million, which is the highest ever income we have generated ever. The EBITDA for 
this quarter was INR 725.22 million, which was last quarter, INR 179.06 million. 
 
The PBT for this quarter is INR 644.61 million as a standalone and this is the highest what we made in one 
quarter. And the PAT is INR 482.34 million which is compared to last quarter INR 71.73 million . If I give you 
figures for the half year, this is the strongest half year ever. The revenue we have created in the half year was 
INR 32,376 million, which is somewhere around 57% higher than the last year. EBITDA is INR 902.28 million. 
And if we talk about PBT, it is INR 740.3 million and profit after tax is INR 554.07 million. This is the strongest 
half year result ever in the HMA. 
 
And I would like to give you the consolidated performance for Q2 . The revenue we have generated as a 
consolidated is INR 21,553.39 million dollars , which is somewhere around 22% substantial growth and 48% 
YoY growth. The total income generated as consolidate is INR 21,914.45 million. The EBITDA is INR 1,315.71 
million. EBITDA margin also expanded for 6.10% from 1.48%. 
 
The PBT we have made in this consolidated quarter is INR 1,170.16 million dollars and the PAT is INR 879.79 
million. This has brought us more confidence, more reliability from the market and a broad -based growth. 
We have higher asset utilization, cost optimization initiative, strong governance and process improvement. 
The conclusion for my today's presentation, quarter two and half year, reflects a significant step forward into 
our company. We have delivered record performance across all indicators like revenue, EBITDA, PBT and PAT, 
both on standalone and consolidated basis. 
 
So with this, I would like to close my small speech. Thanks for your valuable time. Over to you, Nikhil.

Q2 H1 FY26 Results Conference Call 
 
Nikhil Sundrani 
 
Yeah. Thank you, Gulzeb Ji, for giving us the brief on the financial results. Now, we are open for the question-
and-answer sessions. One by one, we will be starting with them. Okay. Thank you. 
 
Moderator 
 
Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question -and-answer session. If you have a 
questions, please press * and 1 on the telephone keypad and wait for your turn to ask a question. If you would 
like to withdraw your request, you may do so by pressing * and 1 again. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a 
questions, please press * and 1 on your telephone keypad . We will wait for a moment while the question  
queue is assembled. 
 
First question comes from Amit Agicha from HG Awa. Please go ahead. 
 
Amit Agicha 
 
Sir, thank you for the opportunity and congratulations for good set of members. Sir, the question is like, is the 
company planning entry into retail package for the value-added consumer brands? 
 
Gulzeb Ahmed 
 
Hello? Can you repeat your question? Your voice is not clear. 
 
Amit Agicha 
 
Yes, sir. Is the company planning entry into retail package goods? 
 
Gulzeb Ahmed 
 
Retail package for India or overseas? You are talking about the retail product for India or overseas? 
 
Amit Agicha 
 
India. 
 
Gulzeb Ahmed 
 
India. We are currently testing the market with our product retail because in India, the eating habit is more 
of chilled or fresh items. So , we are in the testing phase of retail client with our team.  So, we would like to 
enter in India, and it is a for sure, India is one of the biggest market. But we need to educate the clients 
regarding the frozen generic of our product. So, it will take time, but we will be working on it. 
 
Amit Agicha 
 
And sir, as a concentration, basically, besides, like, frozen buffalo meat, like, how much is the other product, 
like? I will just frame my question properly. Like, how does the company plan to diversify beyond frozen 
buffalo meat to reduce export concentration risk? 
 
Gulzeb Ahmed 
 
Reduce what? 
4 
HMA Agro Industries Limited                17.11.2025 
Q2 H1 FY26 Results Conference Call 
 
 
Amit Agicha 
 
I think, frozen buffalo, what else do you do in exports besides? 
 
Gulzeb Ahmed 
 
We are currently exporting basmati rice. It's from India. And we are also planning for very soon to launch our 
frozen vegetables also. And regarding buffalo meat, it has a highest demand of ever red meat available in the 
market. So, this is our core product, and we always work to make it more stronger and to deliver in many, 
many other countries. 
 
Amit Agicha 
 
And so the exceptional margin, which you have mentioned in Q2, like, is it sustainable or driven by temporary 
factors? 
 
Gulzeb Ahmed 
 
For any food product, the margins are always related to the demand and supply. As you see in quarter two, 
there is a very high demand globally. So, we will be able to charge the marginal prices. So, it's totally depends, 
if it is related to our daily used food, it depends on demand and supply. 
 
And we also have competitions from overseas. So , if their supply distract s or their supply increase s, our 
margins always change. 
 
Amit Agicha 
 
And the question is on CapEx, like what is the CapEx plan for FY2627, especially with respect to the Jabalpur 
chicken plant or the leather and pet food doing or the automation upgrades? 
 
Gulzeb Ahmed 
 
For our buffalo business, we don't need much CapEx because we already running under capacity. For chicken 
plant, once we will be entering and increasing, we will need working capital more of the CapEx because most 
of the machine needs are not that much expensive. For chicken CapEx, somewhere around INR 10 crore will 
be enough. 
 
Amit Agicha 
 
FY2627? 
 
Gulzeb Ahmed 
 
Which one? 
 
Amit Agicha 
 
FY2627?

Yeah. FY2627. 
 
Amit Agicha 
 
And so for leather and the pet food division? 
 
Gulzeb Ahmed

people also to take care of the procedure. 
 
Amit Agicha 
 
Okay. I'll join back the queue. Okay. Thank you.

We have a question from Amit Agicha from HG Hawa. Please go ahead. 
 
Amit Agicha 
 
Yes, sir. Am I audible, sir? 
 
Gulzeb Ahmed 
 
Yeah, Mr. Amit. 
 
Amit Agicha 
 
Yeah. I think so there is nobody else in the query, sir. I wanted to just ask a question [inaudible 00:14:00]. 
 
Moderator 
 
Sir, I'm sorry to interrupt. Your voice is not clear. 
 
Amit Agicha 
 
Sir, my question is what is the CapEx of the pet food division? And [inaudible 00:14:20]. 
 
Gulzeb Ahmed 
 
On CapEx, you are asking about the CapEx requirement for pet food? 
6 
HMA Agro Industries Limited                17.11.2025 
Q2 H1 FY26 Results Conference Call 
 
Amit Agicha 
 
Yes. 
 
Gulzeb Ahmed 
 
Currently, as of now, the pet food we are exporting, we have a limited client, and we are able to produce that 
much as in our existing capacity. If we receive more demand, so we will be going to add on some machinery 
and that will be not much. But it totally depends on the demand side. 
 
So, whatever demand we have currently, we have the machine use available. In future, we have more 
demand, more client, so we need to put some machineries. And are only able to reply on this question when 
we assess our demand. 
 
Amit Agicha 
 
Understood, sir. And for chicken, the INR 10 crore CapEx, that that will be from internal accruals o r we'll be 
raising debt or equity? 
 
Gulzeb Ahmed 
 
INR 10 crore CapEx for? 
 
Amit Agicha 
 
A question which I asked you, sir, is for chicken CapEx expansion? 
 
Gulzeb Ahmed 
 
So, that will be for chicken project. 
 
Amit Agicha 
 
So, our funding will be internal or debt? 
 
Gulzeb Ahmed 
 
Internally. Most of them internally or maybe with bank. 
 
Amit Agicha 
 
You will be using debt. Right? 
 
Gulzeb Ahmed 
 
But chicken still has time. Like, we are not needing that capital in the soon of, like, one quarter or two quarter 
because we are focusing on the technology to adopt our finance technology. 
 
Amit Agicha 
 
And sir, how is company navigating the geopolitical and the currency volatility, especially, like, are the new 
markets being explored in Europe, GCC or East Asia? 
7 
HMA Agro Industries Limited                17.11.2025 
Q2 H1 FY26 Results Conference Call 
 
Gulzeb Ahmed 
 
East Asia, we are already supplying with our buffalo product. Europe still ha s time because in Europe, there 
are certain protocols that need to be signed between Indian veterinary and Europe veterinary. But we are 
ready from our side. It's the only G2G matter. Once the market access has been provided to the Europe for 
India products, we will be ready to supply next year. 
 
Amit Agicha 
 
And so would you brief me like the account working capital cycle currently trending? 
 
Gulzeb Ahmed 
 
Amit Ji , I think your voice has some problem. If you don't mind, can you send us the email for all your 
questions, so me and my team are able to reply you. 
 
Amit Agicha 
 
Yes. I will do that.

in the future? 
 
Gulzeb Ahmed 
 
Saurabh Ji, thank you for your question. And as I replied the previous question from Mr. Amit, the food 
business is totally depending on demand and supply. We always pray to Almighty that we will be having a 
good demand and a shorter supply from the overseas people. So, we hope as for now, what we got the data 
from our marketing team, the demand is still there, and we are trying to supply it. And we hope this demand 
will sustain longer and longer.

Okay.
