BROOKFIELD INDIA REAL ESTATE TRUST
Our growth strategy is centered on India’s 
gateway cities – markets where demand is 
deep, durable, and enterprise-led. New Delhi, 
Gurugram, and Noida continue to anchor 
leasing momentum, while Bengaluru remains 
under active evaluation for future expansion. 
Each step reinforces our scale and presence 
in locations that matter most to global 
occupiers.
Occupancy gains across newly acquired 
assets underscore our operational discipline. 
The balanced mix of SEZ and non-SEZ 
spaces provides flexibility, allowing tenants 
to align with both regulatory and business 
requirements. This equilibrium enhances 
leasing resilience and supports steady, long-
term growth.
Portfolio expansion
As we grow our footprint, sustainability 
remains embedded in strategy and 
operations. Our commitments include 
achieving Net Zero by 2040 and 
transitioning to 100% renewable energy  
by 2027. Asset-level initiatives target a  
10% reduction in energy and water 
intensity this year. These priorities are 
integrated across all functions and 
supported by leadership oversight.
Tenant engagement remains central 
to this agenda. Monthly sustainability 
dossiers, quarterly magazines, and annual 
reports provide updates. Joint programs 
such as zero-waste workshops and Net 
Zero alignment sessions build awareness 
and collective action. These initiatives 
strengthen tenant relationships and 
differentiate our campuses.

H1 FY2026 HIGHLIGHTS
Momentum 
Delivered with 
Discipline
We sustained steady growth during  
H1 FY2026. The progress is driven by 
steady market conditions and leasing 
momentum. Proactive leasing and  
re-leasing at improved rentals supported 
higher occupancies. Prudent financial 
management and disciplined capital 
allocation further strengthened our 
balance sheet, reinforcing the foundation 
for long-term value creation and growth.

Who  
We Are

India’s economy continues to demonstrate 
remarkable strength and stability, powered by 
steady domestic demand, a deep talent pool, and 
strong macro fundamentals. A growing middle 
class, accelerating urbanization, and the increasing 
financialization of savings, all converging to create 
promising demand for real assets. As the Indian 
economy advances five to ten trillion dollars over 
the coming decades, this transformation will unfold 
in the physical spaces including office towers, 
logistics hubs and industrial parks, that drive 
productivity and create spaces for people and 
communities to thrive. The built environment is the 
bedrock of economic progress and Brookfield India 
REIT continues to be an enabler of this growth.  
Our focus on disciplined growth is reflected in  
our strong performance in the first half of  
FY2026, underpinned by governance, sustainability, 
and partnerships. 
SEIZING THE INDIA OPPORTUNITY
We have built a market-leading franchise as one 
of India’s largest office landlords, owning and 
developing world-class workplaces across key 
cities pan India. We are strategic partners to global 
companies that, like us, recognize the long-term 
value and potential of being in India.
Companies are diversifying operations and 
restructuring supply chains, making India a natural 
beneficiary of these shifts, with its demographic 
strength, digital ecosystem, talent pool and cost 
competitiveness. We are seeing this reflected in the 
expansion of Global Capability Centres, which now 
anchor demand for office space across key Indian 
cities. GCC-driven demand for office space in India 
rose 8% in the first nine months this year, reaching 
50.9M sf.  
Our assets are best-in-class located in the most 
important urban hubs, and managed with the 
discipline and transparency that institutional 
tenants and investors expect. We continue to 
be the landlord of choice to some of the world’s 
most respected organizations, by housing ~8M sf 
of cutting-edge workspaces for Global Capability 
Centers (GCC) in India. 
DISCIPLINED GROWTH AND SCALE
Since our listing, we have grown our portfolio 
to ~29M sf, making us one of the largest office 
landlords in India. This scale has been achieved 
through a combination of organic growth and 
disciplined acquisitions. In the first half of 
FY2026, the successful preferential issue of 
` 10B, supported by marquee investors, reflects 
confidence in both the strength of our operating 
assets and our governance standards. 
Dear Unitholders,

BROOKFIELD INDIA REAL ESTATE TRUST Who We Are Our Properties Sustainability Investor Relations Statutory Disclosure Financial Statements14 HALF YEARLY REPORT 2025-26
Building on our strong inorganic growth track 
record, we announced the proposed acquisition 
of Ecoworld, a 48-acre, 7.7M sf office campus 
located on the Outer Ring Road in Bengaluru. 
This acquisition will mark our entry into one of 
India’s strongest office markets, expanding the 
size of our REIT by over 30% and positioning 
us as a truly pan India platform. These 
opportunities represent expansion of scale, 
diversification into markets and sectors that 
are well aligned with India’s long-term growth 
drivers.
Our commitment is to ensure that every 
investment we make is accretive to unitholders. 
This discipline has allowed us to build a portfolio 
that is resilient, diversified, and well positioned 
for the future. 
EMBEDDING ESG EXCELLENCE 
We uphold the highest standards of governance, 
ensuring transparency, accountability, and 
ethical conduct in every decision we make.
Sustainability is integral to us, it informs how 
we design, operate, and enhance our assets.  
Several of our marquee campuses achieved 
certifications such as EDGE from IFC, and we 
completed re-certifications under ISO 50001 
for energy management across multiple 
properties. Our commitment to global best 
practices in sustainability was once again 
validated this year as Brookfield India REIT 
received a 5-star GRESB rating for the fourth 
consecutive year. 
We continue to advance toward our goal of 
transitioning to 100% renewable power by 
2027. Already, 40% percent of our portfolio 
operates on green energy, and we are scaling 
this further through innovative bilateral 
procurement models. Tenants increasingly 
seek landlords who can support their 
de-carbonization commitments, and our 
leadership in this space makes us a partner 
of choice.
We continue to invest in wellness programs 
for tenants, host community healthcare 
initiatives, and expand our education and 
urban greening efforts, and provide a  
year-round calendar of events and 
activations to enhance the everyday 
experience of our tenants. 
CONFIDENCE IN THE ROAD AHEAD
The outlook for India’s commercial real estate 
sector remains favorable. With committed 
occupancy of 90% as of September 30, 2025, 
and a healthy pipeline for vacant inventory, 
our platform has significant embedded 
growth potential. SEZ conversions are 
opening new avenues for leasing, and the 
combination of contractual escalations and 
healthy market spreads provides further 
visibility of income growth.
Brookfield India REIT continues to stand out 
for its conservative balance sheet, disciplined 
capital allocation, and consistent track record of 
distributions. Our NAV stood at ` 349 per unit 
as of September 30, 2025, and our AAA-rated 
platform reflects the financial resilience we  
have built.
As we look ahead, our focus remains clear. We will 
continue to deepen our partnerships with global 
enterprises, unlock embedded value within our 
existing portfolio, and pursue new opportunities 
with discipline. We will also maintain our 
leadership in sustainability and governance, 
which we believe are central to creating long-term 
value for unitholders.
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I extend my 
gratitude to all our unitholders, tenants, partners, 
and employees for your continued trust. 
Sincerely,
Ankur Gupta
Chairperson, Board of Directors
Manager of Brookfield India Real Estate Trust

BROOKFIELD INDIA REAL ESTATE TRUST Who We Are Our Properties Sustainability Investor Relations Statutory Disclosure Financial Statements
At Brookfield India REIT, our mission is to build 
and operate India’s most trusted and future-ready 
office platform, one that consistently delivers value 
for our unitholders while advancing the long-term 
story of Indian commercial real estate. The first half 
of FY2026 has been a period of continued strength. 
Robust leasing, resilient financial performance, 
and strategic capital actions have reinforced our 
leadership position.
Even as the global economy adjusts to evolving 
interest rate cycles and shifting capital flows, India 
continues to demonstrate structural resilience. 
With GDP growth expected to remain among the 
highest globally, and with Global Capability Centers 
(GCCs) expanding their footprint at scale, the 
demand for high-quality, institutionally managed 
office assets remains strong. Brookfield India REIT is 
uniquely placed to capture this demand, with scale 
across gateway markets, a diversified portfolio, and 
a proven ability to execute.
INDIA’S OFFICE MARKET: DEMAND 
MOMENTUM HOLDS FIRM
India’s office sector continues to benefit from 
durable growth drivers. GCCs accounted for the 
majority of leasing in the first half of FY2026, 
reaffirming India’s role as a global hub for 
enterprise operations. Continued momentum 
in technology, consulting, BFSI, and emerging 
industries such as life sciences has strengthened 
occupier confidence. 
Supportive policy measures, including repo rate 
reductions by the Reserve Bank of India, are 
improving liquidity conditions and lowering the 
cost of capital. Combined with the government’s 
focus on SEZ reforms and digital infrastructure, 
the operating environment remains favorable for 
continued expansion of office demand.
DELIVERING ON LEASING AND 
OCCUPANCY GAINS
We continued to build on FY2025’s strong leasing 
momentum. During H1 FY2026, we achieved 
gross leasing of 1.2M sf, including 1.1M sf of new 
leases and 0.2M sf of renewals, at an average 
re-leasing spread of 21%. Approximately 54% of 
leasing came from global capability centers (GCCs), 
demonstrating their growing prominence in the 
portfolio. 
Occupancy levels improved further, rising to 
over 90% as of September 30, 2025. SEZ assets 
benefited from policy clarity and successful 
conversions in non-processing areas (NPAs), driving 
leasing across a broader tenant base. The portfolio 
of SEZ properties recorded occupancy of 87%, 
while non-SEZ properties remained resilient at 96%.

ROBUST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Our financial outcomes for the half year reflect 
this strong operating momentum:
  Incom
e from operating lease rentals stood at 
` 9,340M, up 10% YoY.
  Net O
perating Income (NOI) rose to ` 10,080M,

  Same

  Tota

CAPITAL STRATEGY: BALANCED AND

During the half year, we strengthened our capital 
structure and created new capacity for growth.
Our balance sheet remains conservatively 
managed. Loan-to-value (LTV) stood at 21.6%, 
excluding shareholder instruments, with average 
maturity of 10 years and average interest rate of 
7.5% (with 88% of our borrowings being repo-
linked)
EXPANSION PIPELINE: POSITIONED FOR 
GROWTH
We announced the proposed acquisition of 
Ecoworld, a 48-acre, 7.7 million square feet 
Grade A office campus in Bengaluru, one of 
India’s strongest office markets. We signed 
binding agreements to acquire a 100% interest 
in the assets at Ecoworld for ` 131,250M. This 
transaction will expand the size of our REIT by 
over 30%, enhance portfolio diversification, 
and strengthen our position as a pan-India 
platform. The acquisition will be funded through 
a combination of new debt issuance, proceeds 
from the recent preferential issue, and a new 
equity issuance.
With a portfolio valuation of approximately 
` 39,602 crores and a NAV of ` 349 per unit as of 
September 30, 2025, Brookfield India REIT is well-
capitalized to pursue accretive growth.

CONFIDENT IN OUR FUTURE
As we look ahead, the outlook remains robust. 
Leasing demand is expected to stay strong, 
underpinned by GCC growth and rising occupier 
confidence. Our vacant inventory of 2.4M sf 
provides immediate upside potential due to 
favorable demand environment. Robust leasing 
is expected to further drive the Net Operating 
Income (NOI) and the distributions. Combining 
that with embedded rental escalations, mark-
to-market spreads, and a disciplined capital 
allocation framework, Brookfield India REIT is 
well-positioned to deliver sustainable growth in 
distributions and long-term value for unitholders.
We thank you for your continued trust and 
partnership as we build the next chapter of 
India’s commercial real estate story.

TRACK RECORD OF SUSTAINED 
GROWTH
We have consistently scaled our 
portfolio through strategic acquisitions 
and disciplined execution. From 
an initial 14M sf portfolio valued 
at ` 114.8B, we have expanded to 
29.1M sf with a gross asset value of

of over 140 corporates. This journey, 
marked by integration of marquee 
assets, steady leasing momentum, and 
operational excellence, reflects our 
ability to create long-term value and 
drive sustainable growth.
ALIGNED WITH INDIA 
OPPORTUNITY
We are positioned to capture India’s 
strong office demand, supported 
by a projected gross absorption of 
90M sf in 2025. Global Capability 
Centers continue to anchor leasing, 
contributing over one-third of demand 
in H1 FY2026, while post-SEZ reforms 
have expanded occupier diversity, 
driving more than 11% rise in SEZ 
occupancies over 18 months.
GLOBAL SPONSORSHIP WITH 
LOCAL EXPERTISE
We benefit from the strength of 
Brookfield Corporation’s $1T global 
platform and its $278B real estate 
AUM. Combined with our local 
management through Brookprop, we 
are India’s only 100% institutionally

to evaluate strategic acquisitions, 
including a 26M sf sponsor pipeline in 
Bengaluru and Chennai.

STRATEGICALLY LOCATED 
PROPERTIES

Delhi NCR, Gurugram, Noida and 
Kolkata, anchored by marquee assets 
like Candor TechSpace G1, Downtown 
Powai, and Worldmark Delhi. With a 
weighted average lease expiry (WALE)

occupancy, our properties combine 
scale, stability, and strategic presence 
in gateway markets.
PLACEMAKING EXPERTISE
We create workplaces that attract 
global enterprises and foster long-
term engagement. Properties like 
Downtown Powai, Winchester, and One 
Downtown Central have received EDGE 
certification from IFC, recognizing 
over 20% savings in energy, water, 
and embodied energy. Our ability 
to convert campuses into high-
performing, sustainable environments 
underpins strong leasing traction and 
tenant preference.
MARQUEE TENANT BASE
Our tenant base is diverse and 
resilient, with GCCs contributing 61% of

industry expertise and strategic 
foresight. Recent initiatives include

at ` 310 per unit to fund future 
acquisitions, while maintaining a 
prudent financing structure to support 
accretive growth.
SUSTAINABLE OPERATIONS
We are committed to achieving net 
zero carbon by 2040 or sooner. 
Already, 44% of energy at our Delhi-
NCR campuses is sourced from 
renewables, carbon emissions are 
down 44% against a 2030 target of 
50%, and 58% of water is recycled. Our 
efforts have been recognized with ISO 
50001 recertifications and CII Kaizen 
Awards, reinforcing sustainability as a 
core operating principle.
REITS AS A MAINSTREAM  
ASSET CLASS
REITs in India have emerged as a 
mainstream asset class, backed 
by rising investor confidence and 
regulatory support. Brookfield India 
REIT, as one of the founding members 
of the India REITs Association (IRA), 
plays an advocacy role in shaping this 
growing market, now comprising five 
listed REITs with a combined market 
capitalization of over `  1.5T. The 
asset class remains tax-efficient, with 
regulations mandating distribution 
of at least 90% of net cash flows on 
a semi-annual basis. Since inception, 
cumulative distributions have crossed 
` 243B, reflecting a quarterly growth 
rate of over 13%. SEBI and government 
reforms – including SEZ policy changes 
and reduced subscription thresholds 
– have further enhanced accessibility. 
Today, REITs represent nearly 15-20%  
of India’s institutional-grade 
commercial stock, underscoring their 
critical role in deepening the country’s 
capital markets.

portfolio-level assessments to asset-
specific decarbonization. Priority areas 
include operational efficiency, supply-
chain engagement, and transition 
planning, forming an integral part of 
the broader climate strategy.

ENERGY
Energy efficiency is central to Brookfield India REIT’s decarbonization efforts. The focus remains 
on reducing overall energy intensity while increasing the share of renewable power across 
the portfolio. This approach combines demand reduction through operational efficiency with 
a steady transition toward non-fossil-fuel energy sources, reinforcing the REIT’s long-term 
sustainability objectives.
On the supply side, Brookfield India REIT is progressing toward its target of achieving 100% 
renewable electricity by 2027. A long-term agreement has been signed to source clean power 
from the Brookfield Renewable Bikaner Solar Power Project in Rajasthan, which serves office 
parks across the National Capital Region. This arrangement provides occupants with direct

WATER
Brookfield India REIT manages water 
resources responsibly across its portfolio, 
recognizing water as a finite source in urban 
areas. The water management approach 
is anchored in the 4R framework – Reduce, 
Reuse, Recycle, and Replenish – aimed at 
minimizing consumption and improving 
circular use. The long-term objective is 
to achieve water-positive operations by 
replenishing more water than is consumed, 
strengthening the resilience of assets and 
surrounding communities.

WASTE
Brookfield India REIT’s waste management 
framework follows the 5R principle – Reduce, 
Reuse, Recycle, Refuse, and Rot – aimed at 
minimizing waste generation and diverting 
material from landfills. Waste management 
planning is integrated at the design stage 
of every development to ensure long-
term sustainability. Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOPs) guide on-site practices, 
including source segregation through color-
coded bins for dry, organic, and construction 
and demolition (C&D) waste.
Organic waste is processed using in-situ 
composters that convert biodegradable 
material into nutrient-rich compost for 
landscaping, with biannual quality testing 
to ensure compliance. Dry and C&D waste 
are collected and handled by government-
authorized vendors and recyclers.
Continuous engagement with occupiers and 
professionals reinforces responsible waste 
behavior through awareness drives and 
training sessions. Waste generation is tracked 
at the tenant level, and intensity metrics – 
measured as waste per occupant per day 
– are shared biweekly to support data-led 
decision-making. These collective efforts 
have resulted in a higher share of waste 
being recycled year-over-year, strengthening 
operational efficiency and environmental 
performance across the portfolio.

CLIMATE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES
Brookfield India REIT recognizes that climate change poses 
material risks and emerging opportunities for long-term 
business resilience. The REIT’s climate strategy aligns with 
the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and focuses on strengthening 
asset performance against evolving environmental conditions. 
This approach supports operational reliability, cost efficiency, 
and continued relevance to occupiers and investors.
During FY2026, the REIT is initiating a fresh climate risk 
assessment across its portfolio to evaluate both physical and 
transition risks, including exposure to earthquakes, floods, 
heat stress, and sea-level rise. The assessment will update 
earlier analyses conducted in FY2023 and will form the basis 
for revised risk ratings, mitigation measures, and forward-
looking action plans. Insights from this exercise will guide 
strategic decisions and investment priorities over the short, 
medium, and long term, ensuring preparedness for future 
climate scenarios.

Brookfield India REIT recognizes

adopted a biodiversity policy 
that embeds conservation 
principles into operations and 
decision-making. None of its 
properties are located within or 
adjacent to protected areas or 
regions identified as biodiversity 
hotspots. All assets are situated 
on designated-use land parcels, 
where the focus remains on 
minimizing ecological impact 
and preserving natural value.
To advance this commitment, 
the REIT has defined six 
biodiversity enhancement 
strategies, each supported 
by detailed action plans and 
implementation frameworks. 
These strategies guide efforts 
to protect local ecosystems, 
promote green cover, 
and integrate sustainable 
landscaping across the portfolio.

AIR QUALITY
Brookfield India REIT places strong 
emphasis on maintaining high air 
quality standards to support the 
health, well-being, and productivity 
of occupiers and employees. Air 
quality is monitored across assets 
using smart tools and advanced 
technologies that track key 
indicators such as volatile organic 
compounds (VOC), carbon dioxide 
(CO₂), particulate matter (PM₂.₅ and 
PM₁₀), temperature, and humidity. 
Real-time indoor air quality (IAQ) 
data is displayed in lobbies and 
offices to raise awareness among 
occupants and visitors.
As of FY2025, more than 82 IAQ 
devices have been installed across 
the portfolio, including integrated 
monitors within air handling units 
at Candor TechSpace campuses 
in Gurugram and Noida. These 
systems are complemented by 
advanced filtration and emission 
control technologies that ensure 
continuous air purification.
To mitigate outdoor pollution, 
particularly from industrial 
and vehicular sources, the REIT 
deployed over 10 Retrofit Emission 
Control Devices (RECDs) during 
H1 FY2026 across its Delhi-NCR 
assets. These installations have 
reduced particulate matter, carbon 
monoxide, and hydrocarbon 
emissions by nearly 70%.
Brookfield India REIT also promotes responsible construction practices to minimize dust and 
particulate emissions through the following measures:
SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND 
DEVELOPMENT
Sustainability remains central to 
Brookfield India REIT’s business model 
and asset design philosophy. The 
REIT adopts a strategic approach that 
combines selective acquisitions with 
deep retrofits to decarbonize the built 
environment and reduce embodied 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within 
existing infrastructure.
The design framework is guided by 
two core objectives:
Enhancing operational efficiency of 
existing assets through deep retrofitting 
and continuous upgrades, thereby 
lowering future emissions from the 
global building stock
Creating climate-responsive,

centric principles and guided by its design guidelines for sustainable 
workspaces and biodiversity. This integrated framework ensures that 
all assets are developed with measurable impact goals across energy, 
water, waste, and ecology, in direct alignment with the REIT’s Net Zero 
2040 roadmap.
Beyond environmental performance, the strategy emphasizes the 
creation of socially responsible spaces that foster connection, equity, 
and inclusivity. The management ecosystem connects design and 
operations through continuous feedback loops, enabling collaboration 
and real-time innovation. This integrated approach allows the REIT

ENHANCING STUDENT  
WELL-BEING THROUGH 
IMPROVED SANITATION
To ensure a clean, safe and supportive 
learning environment, we implemented a 
comprehensive WASH (Water, Sanitation 
and Hygiene) project at Tikri School in 
Gurugram. This initiative was designed 
to improve sanitation infrastructure, 
maintain hygiene standards and foster 
long-term behavioral change among 
students and staff.
The project focused on the deployment 
of trained personnel, regular 
maintenance and hygiene education – 
ensuring that the school environment 
remains conducive to learning. By 
maintaining toilet facilities built in FY2023 
and upholding cleanliness protocols, the 
intervention has significantly reduced 
health risks, improved attendance and 
enhanced students’ ability to focus and 
thrive academically.
Beyond physical infrastructure, the 
initiative has contributed to students’ 
mental well-being and dignity, especially 
for adolescent girls, by providing safe 
and hygienic sanitation facilities. These 
improvements are essential for holistic 
development and long-term educational 
outcomes.

CONCLUSION 
4.  Based on our review conducted and procedures 
per
formed as stated in paragraph 3 above, nothing 
has come to our attention that causes us to believe 
that the accompanying Condensed Standalone 
Interim Financial Statements, prepared in 
accordance with the REIT Regulations which prevails 
over certain Ind AS requirements as explained in 
the Emphasis of Matter paragraph 5 below, and also 
in accordance with the relevant Ind AS and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India 
has not disclosed the information required to be 
disclosed in terms of REIT Regulations, including 
the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it 
contains any material misstatement.
Independent Auditor’s Report
On Review of Condensed Standalone Interim Financial Statements
  These Condensed Standalone Interim Financial 
Sta
tements are being submitted by the Manager 
pursuant to the requirements of Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (Real Estate Investment 
Trusts) Regulations, 2014 as amended (the “REIT 
Regulations”).
2.
  The Co
ndensed Standalone Interim Financial 
Statements, which is the responsibility of the 
Manager’s Board of Directors, have been prepared 
in accordance with the requirements of the REIT 
Regulations, Indian Accounting Standard 34 “Interim 
Financial Reporting” (“Ind AS 34”), prescribed 
under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read 
with relevant rules issued thereunder, and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India. 
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the 
Condensed Standalone Interim Financial Statements 
based on our review.
SCOPE OF REVIEW
3.  We conducted our review of the Condensed 
Sta
ndalone Interim Financial Statements in 
accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 ‘Review of Interim Financial 
Information Performed by the Independent Auditor 
of the Entity’, issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (ICAI). This standard requires 
that we plan and perform the review to obtain 
moderate assurance as to whether the Statement 
is free of material misstatement. A review of interim 
financial information consists of making inquiries, 
primarily of the Manager’s personnel responsible 
for financial and accounting matters, and applying 
analytical and other review procedures. A review is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted 
in accordance with Standards on Auditing issued 
by ICAI and consequently does not enable us to 
obtain assurance that we would become aware of all 
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. 
Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
EMPHASIS OF MATTER 
5.  We draw attention to Note 7(a)(i) of the Condensed 
Sta
ndalone Interim Financial Statements, which 
describe the presentation of “Unit Capital” as “Equity” 
to comply with REIT Regulations. Our conclusion is 
not modified in respect of this matter.

1. Measurement of fair values       
  The fa
ir value of investments in SPVs is primarily determined basis the fair value of the underlying investment 
property (including investment property under development) and book value of other assets and liabilities of the 
respective SPV’s as at 30 September 2025 and 31 March 2025. The fair value of investment properties (including 
investment property under development) has been determined by independent external registered property valuer, 
having appropriately recognized professional qualifications and recent experience in the location and category of 
the properties being valued. 
 
Valuation technique
  The fa
ir value measurement of the investment properties (including investment property under development) has 
been categorized as a Level 3 fair value based on the inputs to the valuation technique used.
  The va
luers have followed a discounted cash flow method. The discounted cash flow method considers the present 
value of net cash flows to be generated from the respective properties, taking into account the expected rental 
growth rate, vacancy period, occupancy rate, average sq. ft. rent and lease incentive costs. The expected net cash 
flows are discounted using the risk adjusted discount rates. Among other factors, the discount rate estimation 
considers the quality of a building and its location (prime vs secondary), tenant credit quality, lease terms and 
investors expected return.

   # Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities which are recognized at amortized cost has been disclosed to be same as carrying value 
as the carrying value approximately equals to their fair value.
   *Fai
r value of loans and Non convertible debentures which are recognized at amortized cost, has been calculated at the present value of the 
future cash flows discounted at the current borrowing rate.
   ^Fair value of Debentures (Compulsorily Convertible Debentures) is determined on the basis of Net assets value (NAV) method. These CCDs 
are classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to the inclusion of unobservable inputs. The key input to the NAV is fair value of the 
investment properties.
 ii)  Meas urement of fair values
  The di
fferent levels of fair value have been defined below:
Level 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices for instance listed 
equity instruments, traded bonds and mutual funds that have quoted price.
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, traded 
bonds, over-the counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques which maximize the use of 
observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs 
required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is 
included in level 3.
There have been no valuation under Level 1 and Level 2. There has been no  transfers into or out of Level 3 of 
the fair value hierarchy for the period ended 30 September 2025 and year ended 31 March 2025.
Brookfield India REIT's policy is to recognize transfers into and transfers out of fair value hierarchy levels as at 
the end of the reporting period.
 
 iii)  Deta
ils of significant unobservable inputs
  
Significant unobservable inputs Inter-relationship between significant unobservable inputs and fair value
Financial assets measured at fair 
value (15% CCDs)
Fair value of investment property The estimated fair value would increase (decrease) if fair value of investment

 iv)  Sensitivity analysis of Level 3 fair values     
   For th
e fair value of CCDs, reasonably possible changes at the reporting date due to one of the significant 
unobservable inputs, holding other inputs constant, would have following effects:

CONCLUSION 
5.  Based on our review conducted and procedures 
per
formed as stated in paragraph 3 above, nothing 
has come to our attention that causes us to believe 
that the accompanying Condensed Consolidated 
Interim Financial Statements, prepared in accordance 
Independent Auditor’s Report
On Review of Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements
  These Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial 
Sta
tements are being submitted by the Manager 
pursuant to the requirements of Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (Real Estate Investment 
Trusts) Regulations, 2014 as amended (the “REIT 
Regulations”).
2.
  The Con
densed Consolidated Interim Financial 
Statements, which is the responsibility of the 
Manager’s Board of Directors, have been prepared 
in accordance with the requirements of the REIT 
Regulations, Indian Accounting Standard 34 “Interim 
Financial Reporting” (“Ind AS 34”), prescribed 
under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 
read with relevant rules issued thereunder, and 
other accounting principles generally accepted in 
India. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion 
on the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial 
Statements based on our review. 
SCOPE OF REVIEW
3.  We conducted our review of the Condensed 
Cons
olidated Interim Financial Statements 
in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial 
Information Performed by the Independent Auditor 
of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (ICAI). This standard requires 
that we plan and perform the review to obtain 
moderate assurance as to whether the Statement 
is free of material misstatement. A review of interim 
financial information consists of making inquiries, 
primarily of Manager’s personnel responsible for 
financial and accounting matters and applying 
analytical and other review procedures. A review is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted 
in accordance with Standards on Auditing issued 
by ICAI and consequently does not enable us to 
obtain assurance that we would become aware of 
all significant matters that might be identified in 
an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit 
opinion. 
  We hav
e also performed procedures in accordance 
with regulation 13(5) of the REIT Regulations, as 
amended, to the extent applicable. 
with the REIT Regulations which prevails over certain 
Ind AS requirements as explained in the Emphasis 
of Matter paragraph 5 below, and also in accordance 
with the relevant Ind AS and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, has not 
disclosed the information required to be disclosed 
in terms of REIT Regulations, including the manner 
in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any 
material misstatement. 
EMPHASIS OF MATTER 
6.  We draw attention to Note 12(a)(i) of the Condensed 
Con
solidated Interim Financial Statements, which 
describes the presentation of “Unit Capital” as 
“Equity” to comply with REIT Regulations. Our 
conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter.

March 2025) pertaining to the relevant properties has also been adjusted.
Measurement of fair values
The fair value of investment properties (including investment property under development) has been determined by 
independent external registered property valuers, having appropriately recognized professional qualifications and 
recent experience in the location and category of the properties being valued.
Valuation technique 
The fair value measurement of the investment properties (including investment property under development) has been 
categorized as a Level 3 fair value based on the inputs to the valuation technique used.
The valuers have followed a discounted cash flow method. The discounted cash flow method considers the present 
value of net cash flows to be generated from the respective properties, taking into account the expected rental growth 
rate, vacancy period, occupancy rate, average sq. ft. rent and lease incentive costs. The expected net cash flows are 
discounted using the risk adjusted discount rates. Among other factors, the discount rate estimation considers the 
quality of a building and its location (prime vs secondary), tenant credit quality, lease terms and investors expected 
return.
For fair valuation of financial assets refer note 34.

  Cand
or Kolkata has plans to de-notify a portion of its SEZ into non SEZ. The denotification will be taken up prior 
to the construction commencement and is procedural in nature. Hence, the fair valuation of such SEZ portion has

 ii) Measurement of fair values
The different levels of fair value have been defined below:
Level 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices for instance listed 
equity instruments, traded bonds and mutual funds that have quoted price.
Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, traded 
bonds, over-the counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques which maximize the use of 
observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs 
required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is 
included in level 3.
There have been no valuation under Level 1 and Level 2. There has been no transfers into or out of Level 3 of 
the fair value hierarchy for the quarter/ half year ended 30 September 2025 and year ended 31 March 2025.
Brookfield India REIT policy is to recognize transfers into and transfers out of fair value hierarchy levels as at 
the end of the reporting period.

  Brookfield India REIT considers “other assets” as an integral part of the ownership of the real estate assets which 
are fa
ir valued by the valuer appointed under the REIT regulations and therefore are included in the value of REIT 
assets for computing the above ratio.
  Fair v
alue of Investment property and Investment property under development include impact of lease rent 
equalization and finance receivable relating to income support. Hence the carrying amount of lease rent 
equalization and finance receivable relating to income support have been reduced from other assets.
  Fair v
alue of Investment property and Investment property under development include fair value pertaining to a 
property, which is for captive use w.e.f. 27 December 2024 and hence classified as property plant and equipment in 
the consolidated financials. Therefore, the carrying amount of said property has been excluded from other assets 
as on 30 September 2025 and 31 March 2025.

Summary Valuation Report
3. VALUATION APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY 
3.1 Purp
ose of Valuation
  The Report is being prepared to be relied upon by the Reliant Parties and inclusion, as a whole, a summary thereof 
or an
y extracts of the report, in any documents prepared in relation for the disclosure of valuation of assets 
forming part of the portfolio of Brookfield India REIT under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Real Estate 
Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014 [SEBI (REIT) Regulations], as amended, together with circulars,  clarifications, 
guidelines and notifications thereunder by SEBI and also disclosure as per fair value accounting under Indian 
Accounting Standards (Ind AS 40).
3.2 Valuation Guideline and Definition 
  Given the purpose of valuation as mentioned above, the valuation exercise has been carried out to estimate the 
“Ma
rket Value” of the Subject Properties in accordance with the IVSC International Valuation Standards issued in 
2021 and effective from 31 January 2022. 
  As per I
VSC International Valuation Standards, “Market Value” is defined as per IVS Standard 104 as ‘The estimated 
amount for which an asset or liability should exchange on the valuation date between a willing buyer and a willing 
seller in an arm’s-length transaction after proper marketing and where the parties had each acted knowledgeably, 
prudently and without compulsion.’
3.3 Valuation Approach 
The basis of valuation for the Subject Property being Market Value, the same has been derived by the following 
approach: 
Discounted Cash Flow Method using Rental Reversion 
The market practice in most commercial/ IT developments involves contracting tenants in the form of pre-
commitments at sub-market rentals to increase attractiveness of the property to prospective tenants typically 
extended to anchor tenants. Additionally, there are instances of tenants paying above-market rentals for certain 
properties as well (primarily owing to market conditions at the time of contracting the lease). In order to arrive at a 
unit value for these tenancies, we have considered the impact of such sub/above market leases on the valuation of 
the Subject Property. 
For the purpose of the valuation of Subject Properties, Income Approach – Discounted Cash Flow Method using 
Rental Reversion has been adopted. 
3.4 Valuation Methodology 
In order to compute the Market Value of the Subject Property the following understanding /assessment is required:
a. Micro M
arket Assessment where the Subject Property is located.
b.  Portf
olio Assessment (existing and future supply, demand from occupiers, average office space take up by an 
occupier in a particular sector, existing vacancy and the rentals)
c.   Situ
ation of the Subject Property (current achievable rentals, vacancy numbers, competing supply in the micro 
market etc.) with respect to the micro market.
The details are elaborated below: 
 Mark
et Assessment: 
The Client appointed Cushman & Wakefield (C&WI) to prepare an independent industry and market research report, 
which has been relied upon to develop the understanding and assess the relevant micro-markets of the Subject 
Property. The said review, was carried out in the following manner:
  Deta
ils study of the market dynamics influencing the rents along with Subject Property rents.
  Asse
ssment of the location setting of the Subject Property in the respective micro-markets.
   Asce
rtain the transaction activity of office space based on the findings of the industry/market report prepared 
by C&WI and readily available information in public domain.
   Revi
ew of comparable properties in terms of potential competition (both completed and under-construction/
future developments), comparable recent lease transactions witnessed in the micro-market along with the 
trends in leasing within the Subject Property in recent past, wherever available.
The above analysis support to form an opinion on the applicable rental for the micro-market where the respective 
Subject Property are located (market rent) and on achievable rent for the respective Subject Property for leasing 
vacant spaces, as well as upon re-leasing of the existing let out area. 
 Port
folio & Rental Assessment:
   Prope
rty Documents and architect certificates were reviewed for validation of area details, ownership interests 
of the Subject Property.
  Phys
ical site inspections were conducted to assess the current status of the Subject Property.
   The ren
t rolls along with corresponding leases deeds (on a reasonable sample basis) were reviewed to identify 
tenancy characteristics for the Subject Property.
 Prep
aration of Future Cash Flows:
  Comp
uting the monthly rental income projected and translating the same to a quarterly cash flow.
  The op
erational expenses of the respective properties are reviewed to understand the recurring, non-
recurring, recoverable and non-recoverable nature expenses and accordingly estimate the margins on the 
common area maintenance income, which accrues as cash inflows to the Subject Property and normalised for 
the purpose of cash flow projections
  The pr
ojected future cash flows from the Subject Property are based on existing lease terms for the 
operational area till the expiry of the leases or re-negotiation, whichever is earlier, following which, the lease 
terms have been aligned with market rents achievable by the Subject Property.
  The ca
sh flows for the operational, under construction and future development area have been projected 
separately for the purpose of estimating and reporting valuation in accordance with the SEBI (REIT) Regulations
  For va
cant area, under-construction area and future development area, the achievable market rent-led 
cash flows are projected factoring appropriate lease-up time frame for vacant/under-construction/future 
development area.
  Recu
rring operational expenses, fit-out income (wherever applicable, however, the same has not been included 
in the NOI for the purpose of arriving at the terminal value by capitalisation) and vacancy provision have been 
adopted in-line with prevalent market practices and conditions.
  In add
ition, appropriate rent-free periods have been adopted during lease roll-overs to consider potential rent-
free terms as well as outflows towards brokerage.
   Thes e cash flows have been projected for 10-year duration from the date of valuation wherein 11 th year Net 
operating income (NOI) is capitalized for the assessment of terminal value. These future cash flows are then 
discounted to present-day value (valuation date) at an appropriate discount rate to arrive at the Market Value 
of the Subject Property.
   For Su
bject Property those are leasehold in nature, these cash flows have been projected for a duration until 
the land lease for the Subject Property expires. These future cash flows are then discounted to present day 
value (valuation date) at an appropriate discount rate to arrive at the Market Value of the Subject Property.
3.5 Information Sources 
The Subject Property related information for the valuation exercise have been provided by the Client and the 
market data has been provided by Cushman and Wakefield, unless otherwise mentioned. The documents provided 
has been assumed to be a true copy of the original. The rent rolls have been cross checked with the lease deeds on

5.3 Discount Rate
The discount rate applied to the available cash flows reflects the opportunity cost to all the capital providers, 
namely shareholders (Cost of Equity) and creditors (Cost of Debt), weighted by the relative contribution to the total 
capital of the company (WACC). The opportunity cost to the capital provider equals the rate of return the capital 
provider expects to earn on other investments of equivalent risk.
  Cost o
f Debt
The cost of debt is the return that a company provides to its debtholders and creditors. These capital providers 
need to be compensated for any risk exposure that comes with lending to a company. The cost of debt for real 
estate assets is often influenced by the stage of development of the asset. The mature and income-generating 
assets are considered less risky, leading to lower interest rates. In this context, the cost of debt for Brookfield 
India REIT properties is benchmarked to the interest rates observed in REITs, as all bear similar characteristics 
in terms of type and development status of properties. Since a major portion of REITs’ portfolios consists of 
completed, income-generating assets, the cost of debt aligns more closely with the Lease Rent Discounting 
(LRD) rate.
This approach ensures that the cost of debt is aligned with the risk profile of the property and current market 
conditions,
Please find below Cost of Debt for Comparable REIT.
Entity Name Cost of Debt
Embassy Office Parks REIT 7.55%
Mindspace Business Park REIT 7.84%
Brookfield India Real Estate Trust 8.10%
Knowledge Realty Trust 8.99%
  Sour ce: Analyst Presentation for respective REIT
The cost of debt for September 2025 valuation is considered as ~ 8.4 %, which been determined based on the 
cost of debt for the REITs.
  Cost o
f Equity
  We hav
e considered the cost of equity at 14.50% as per the market return expectations of various investors for 
commercial office. Apart from that we have also benchmarked CAPM model and inputs of same is detailed out 
as under
•
 We hav
e considered risk free rate of 6.97% based on average 10-year treasury bond yield.
• For ca
lculation of beta, we have benchmarked industry (Nifty Realty Index). We have considered average 
5-year Beta of Nifty Realty index with respect to Nifty 50.  
• We hav
e considered market risk premium of 4.53% based on the returns of broad-based BSE 500 stock 
index for the past 10 to 15 years.
  Debt
-Equity Ratio (weightage of WACC)
  As dis
cussed earlier, the cost of debt has been derived based on prevailing LRD rates, while the cost of 
equity has been calibrated to account for both asset-specific and market-specific factors, reflecting investor 
expectations from an operational Grade A office spaces. Additionally, the debt-to-equity mix has been 
determined considering the typical LRD tenures and the extent to which debt financing contributes to the 
overall asset value.
  It may b
e noted basis management representation that the current debt equity structure of Brookfield India 
REIT is 30:70. However, SEBI REIT Regulations states that the maximum permissible limit for debt is 49%. Hence, 
we have considered the debt and equity mix of 45% and 55% which lies well within the limit specified as per the 
SEBI REIT Regulations and is also accepted by the market participants.
Derivation of WACC
Based on above, the following WACC rate has been assumed for completed commercial assets part of the Brookfield 
India REIT:
Cost Weightage
Cost of Debt 8.4% 45.0% ~11.75%
Cost of Equity 14.5% 55.0%
 Note: As per management representation planned debt equity structure for Brookfield India REIT is 45:55.

• Source: Secondary Market Research
• Note
: The above information is based on information published in public domain and discussions with various market players
Based on these considerations, an exit capitalisation rate ranging between 7.5% and 8.5% has been adopted, with the lower end of the range applied to assets 
demonstrating superior performance and fundamentals within the portfolio. Thus we have considered the cap rate as 8% for the valuation of G1, G2, N1, N2, Worldmark 
Gurgaon, Airtel Centre, Kairos, Kensington. For K1 we have considered cap rate of 8.5% and for Pavilion Mall cap rate has been assumed to be 8.75% in line with the 
available market information and appropriately adjusted for the overall occupancy/performance level of the Subject Property and location of the Subject property being in 
Tier 3 city, as the comparable transactions are located in Tier 1 City.
Capitalisation rate assumptions
The capitalization rate adopted for valuing various assets has been based on factors such as:
    Rele
vant parameters of some key investments in comparable properties of similar quality, use, tenant profile made by institutional real estate investors were 
perused. Further, considering that these investments have been made through institutional player, the cap rate for the Subject Property was suitably adjusted. 
 The se
lected comparable investments consist of investment-grade A properties with a similar tenant profile, commercial usage backed by institutional investors. 
These properties primarily include large office parks, aligning closely with the characteristics of the REIT properties. Considering these criteria, following comparable 
transactions have been analyzed to derive the capitalization rate:

any responsibility or liability with respect to, any loss, 
howsoever, arising from any use or reliance on this 
Report or its content or otherwise arising in connection 
therewith. Unless otherwise stated in this Report, the 
information contained herein is based on management 
information as they exist as of the date indicated in 
this Report or as on September 30, 2025 if no date is 
mentioned and estimates. The information contained 
herein is subject to change without notice and past 
performance is not indicative of future results.
Brookfield India REIT acquired a 50% interest in Rostrum, 
which in turn holds (a) 100% interest in Aspen, Oak and 
Arnon. The investment in Rostrum is accounted for in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity 
method of accounting with effect from June 21, 2024. 
Under the equity method of accounting, the investment 
is initially recognised at cost on the date of acquisition 
and adjusted thereafter, to recognise the Brookfield India 
REIT’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses (after 
tax) of Rostrum.
The operational numbers given in this Report with respect 
to Rostrum, Aspen, Arnon and Oak are on hundred percent 
basis, however, Brookfield India REIT owns fifty percent 
stake through Rostrum. Brookfield India REIT owns assets 
through various Asset SPVs. Some of the Asset SPVs owns 
more than one asset, for the purpose of calculation of 
number of total assets, assets held by Festus and Kairos 
in Downtown Powai, Mumbai are counted as one Grade 
A, asset in Mumbai and assets held by Oak and Aspen in 
Aerocity, New Delhi are counted as single Grade A asset.

looking statements. Due to various risks and uncertainties, 
actual events or results or the actual performance of 
Brookfield India REIT may differ materially from those 
reflected or contemplated in such forward looking 
statements. Although Brookfield India REIT believes 
that the anticipated future results, performance or 
achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking 
statements and information are based upon reasonable 
assumptions and expectations in light of the information 
presently available, you should not place undue reliance on 
forward-looking statements and information because they 
involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other 
factors which may cause the actual results, performance 
or achievements of Brookfield India REIT to differ 
materially from anticipated future results, performance 
or achievement expressed or implied by such forward-
looking statements and information. Factors that could 
cause actual results to differ materially from those set 
forward in the forward looking statements or information 
include but are not limited to: general economic conditions, 
changes in interest and exchange rates, availability of 
equity and debt financing and risks particular to underlying 
portfolio company investments. There is no guarantee that 
Brookfield India REIT will be able to successfully execute 
on all or any future deals, projects or exit strategies, 
achieve leasing plans, secure debt or receive development 
approvals as set forth herein. Projected results reflected 
herein have been prepared based on various estimations 
and assumptions made by management, including 
estimations and assumptions about events that have 
not yet occurred. Due to various risks, uncertainties and 
changes beyond the control of the Manager, the actual 
performance of Brookfield India REIT could differ materially 
from the projected results set forth herein, if any. There 
is no assurance, representation or warranty being made 
by any person that any of the projected results set forth 
herein will be achieved and undue reliance shall not be 
placed on them. Industry experts may disagree with the 
assumptions used in presenting the projected results.
Any changes to assumptions could have a material impact 
on projections and actual returns. Actual returns on 
unrealized investments will depend on, among other 
factors, future operating results, the value of the assets 
and market conditions at the time of disposition, legal and 
contractual restrictions on transfer that may limit liquidity, 
any related transaction costs and the timing and manner 
of sale, all of which may differ from the assumptions and 
circumstances on which the valuations used in the prior 
performance data contained herein are based.

investments may differ materially from the returns 
indicated herein, if any.

contained herein, you should bear in mind that past 
performance is not necessarily indicative of future 
results and there can be no assurance that comparable 
results will be achieved, that an investment will be 
similar to the historic investments presented herein 
(because of economic conditions, the availability of 
investment opportunities or otherwise), that targeted 
returns, diversification or asset allocations will be met
