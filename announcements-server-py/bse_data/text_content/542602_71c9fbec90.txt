Chairman’s Statement
Dear Unitholders,
With robust leasing 
momentum, strong 
occupancy levels, 
continued balance 
sheet strength, and 
another quarter of 
record distributions, 
Embassy REIT remains 
a category leader, not 
only in India, but also 
among listed office 
REITs globally.
Mr. Jitendra Virwani
Chairman
SEBI’s recent move to 
classify REITs as an equity 
product is an important 
structural reform. It places 
India in line with global 
market practice, strengthens 
the capital formation 
ecosystem for real estate, 
and creates a deeper, more 
inclusive investor base.
At the Forefront of India’s 
Office Growth Cycle
The first half of FY2026 has 
been a period of strong delivery, 
strategic discipline, and continued 
confidence in the enduring demand 
for high-quality office infrastructure 
in India. Embassy REIT entered its 
seventh year as a listed entity with a 
clear vision - to build a world-class, 
institutional real estate platform 
anchored in long-term value 
creation. We are pleased to report 
that the REIT continues to deliver 
strongly on that mandate.
Our performance over the past six 
months reflects both the strength 
of the underlying business and 
the depth of tenant demand for 
modern, scalable office ecosystems. 
With robust leasing momentum, 
strong occupancy levels, continued 
balance sheet strength, and another 
quarter of record distributions, 
Embassy REIT remains a category 
leader, not only in India, but also 
among listed office REITs globally.
What gives us confidence is 
not just the quarter-on-quarter 
numbers, but the durability of 
the fundamentals behind them. 
India has firmly established itself 
as the global headquarters for 
talent, technology, and services 
delivery. Multinational and domestic 
enterprises continue to choose India 
to build, scale, and future-proof 
their businesses. Our REIT, with its 
over 50 million square foot portfolio 
and deep tenant relationships, is 
a direct beneficiary of this multi-
decade trend.
We would also like to highlight 
a landmark development for the 
broader REIT industry. SEBI’s recent 
move to classify REITs as an equity 
product is an important structural 
reform. It places India in line with 
global market practice, strengthens 
the capital formation ecosystem for 
real estate, and creates a deeper, 
more inclusive investor base. For 
Embassy REIT, this reform is aligned 
with our long-stated ambition: to 
be a long-term, yield-generating, 
trusted investment platform for all 
classes of investors.
During the period, the Board was 
also pleased to appoint Amit 
Shetty as Chief Executive Officer. 
With his pedigreed relationships 
within the leasing community and 
strong development and asset 
management capabilities, Amit will 
take the REIT to greater heights 
in this growth cycle for the Indian 
office market.
We are also pleased to have Arvind 
Kathpalia rejoin the Board, now 
as an Independent Director. With 
decades of experience across 
finance, investments, governance, 
and risk, Arvind brings deep 
institutional expertise that will be 
invaluable as we continue to scale 
our business.
On behalf of the Board, I would like 
to thank all our valued unitholders 
for your continued trust and 
support. With a strong platform, 
a highly capable team, and a large 
runway for growth, we believe 
Embassy REIT is well positioned 
to deliver sustained performance 
today and compounding value over 
the long term.

CEO’s Letter
Across Q1 and Q2, we 
leased a combined
square feet (msf) 
across 45 deals. This 
includes 2.0 msf in 
Q1, our highest first-
quarter leasing since 
listing, followed by 1.5 
msf in Q2. Chennai 
saw strong pre-leasing 
traction with over 
560,000 sf committed 
at our recently 
acquired Embassy 
Splendid TechZone, 
while Bengaluru 
accounted for over 85% 
of Q2 leasing.

Mr. Amit Shetty
Chief Executive Officer 
Dear Unitholders,
I am really pleased to write to you 
in my first communication as Chief 
Executive Officer of Embassy REIT 
at such an exciting moment for 
our business. I am grateful to the 
Board of Directors for their trust in 
me, and I look forward to working 
closely with my colleagues to 
continue delivering sustained value 
to all our stakeholders.
The first half of FY2026 has been 
stellar, marked by strong leasing, 
consistent financial performance, 
and continued execution across our 
growth pipeline. Our business is in 
excellent health, backed by strong 
fundamentals and demand tailwinds 
that reinforce India’s position as the 
global hub.
Across Q1 and Q2, we leased 
a combined 3.5 million square 
feet (msf) across 45 deals. This 
includes 2.0 msf in Q1, our highest 
first-quarter leasing since listing, 
followed by 1.5 msf in Q2. Chennai 
saw strong pre-leasing traction 
with over 560,000 sf committed 
at our recently acquired Embassy 
Splendid TechZone, while 
Bengaluru accounted for over 85% 
of Q2 leasing. With this momentum, 
portfolio occupancy has risen this 
quarter to 93% by value (90% by 
area), led by Bengaluru at 95%, 
Mumbai at 100%, Chennai at 96%, 
and Noida at 92%.
Our financial performance continues 
to compound steadily. In the first 
half of the year, Revenue from 
Operations grew 13% YoY to H2,184 
crores, while Net Operating Income 
rose 15% YoY to H1,799 crores. We 
distributed H1,167 crores in H1, up 
8% YoY, including our highest-ever 
quarterly distribution of H617 crores 
in Q2. Embassy REIT remains one of 
the most reliable yield instruments 
in India’s public markets, backed by 
stable cash flows and high-quality 
tenants. 
We further strengthened our balance 
sheet through disciplined and 
strategic capital management. In Q1, 
we raised H4,225 crores at a blended 
7.18% coupon, including the lowest-
cost NCD issuance (H750 crore at a 
6.97% coupon) by the REIT in the 
past four years. In Q2, we completed 
the first-ever 10-year listed NCD by 
an Indian REIT, raising H2,000 crores 
from marquee investors, followed by 
commercial paper issuance of H400 
crores at ~6.44%. These transactions 
highlight the depth of institutional 
confidence in our credit profile and 
our ability to access long-dated, 
cost-efficient capital.
Our growth engines remain firmly 
in motion. We delivered 0.9 msf 
of fully leased development in 
Bengaluru to a Fortune 500 global 
retailer. We also launched 2 msf of 
new development in Chennai, taking 
our active development pipeline 
to 7.2 msf across Bengaluru and 
Chennai, with 42% already pre-
leased, including expansion option. 
In parallel, our hospitality portfolio 
delivered 12% EBITDA growth in the 
second quarter, benefiting from a 
16% increase in room rates across 
operating hotels.
We continue to evaluate multiple 
inorganic growth opportunities, 
including a potential ~3.3 msf 
commercial project in Whitefield, 
Bengaluru, for which we have 
received an invitation to offer from 
Embassy Developments Limited, 
and select third-party acquisitions 
opportunities.
Embassy REIT enters the second half 
of the year with strong momentum, 
high visibility on earnings, and a 
balance sheet built for growth. India 
is poised to become the fourth-
largest office market globally, and 
our institutional-grade portfolio is 
exceptionally well positioned to 
capture this growth.
As I step into this role, I remain 
committed to strengthening our 
leadership in the Indian REIT 
market, deepening engagement 
with our 270+ blue-chip occupiers, 
scaling our development and 
acquisition pipeline with discipline, 
and enhancing unitholder value 
through stable distributions and 
accretive growth.
I am truly excited to lead Embassy 
REIT at this pivotal moment. We 
have exceptional assets, a strong 
team, a deep tenant franchise, 
and a supportive capital base. Our 
focus remains clear: deliver stable 
distributions, scale the platform 
responsibly, and create enduring 
value for all our stakeholders.
Thank you for your continued trust 
and partnership.
Mr. Amit Shetty

ESG Focus at Embassy REIT
Embassy REIT is focused on 
providing best-in-class wellness and 
sustainability-oriented workspaces 
to our marquee occupier base 
of over 270. Over the years, we 
have initiated numerous programs 
focusing on the environment, 
social and wellness aspects and 
have adopted a best-in-class 
governance structure since our 
listing. In the past few years, we 
have moved beyond driving ad-hoc 
sustainability programs and have 
adopted a holistic Environmental, 
Social and Governance (ESG’) 
framework focused around 3 key 
pillars - Resilient Planet, Revitalized 
Communities and Responsible 
Business.
We have been at the forefront of 
catalyzing positive change and 
have ingrained sustainability into 
our very core and across all our 
business functions. Our sheer 
scale and on-ground partnerships 
help us collaborate across the 
value chain and create ‘network 
effects’, which further amplify our 
combined environmental and social 
contributions.
We believe that our ability to 
develop and maintain sustainable 
and energy-efficient buildings is 
a clear competitive advantage 
in a market increasingly focused 
on high-quality sustainable 
workspaces. We want to ensure 
that our business leaves a positive 
impact on the lives of the people 
we touch, directly or indirectly. We 
recognize that our journey towards 
sustainability is ongoing, and we are 
committed to keep raising the bar 
on our sustainability efforts.

Pathway to Net Zero
In March 2022, we announced our commitment to achieve net zero-carbon emissions by 2040 across our 
operational portfolio, three decades ahead of India’s 2070 target set at the Glasgow COP26 summit in 2021. This 
commitment is aligned with the broader goals of our occupiers, unitholders, and other key stakeholders, who 
share our vision of a more sustainable future.

Increase usage of renewable 
energy, through both 
internal and third-party 
Initiatives

REIT.
SCOPE 1
Indirect emissions produced offsite 
as a result of purchased energy 
such as electricity and heat.

We strive to directly reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions; and are working closely to align strategies with our 
suppliers, contractors, and occupiers to reduce select Scope 3 emissions. Further, we are also in the process of 
assessing and creating an inventory for our emissions under Scope 3. For all future acquisitions, we aim to bring 
the asset under the purview of our net zero commitment within 5 years post the completion of the acquisition.

Our ESG Strategy and Framework
Our ESG strategy focuses on evolving and implementing sustainable interventions that contribute towards building 
a safer, healthier and greener environment for our staff, occupiers, vendors and the communities in which we 
operate, while delivering enhanced returns for our investors. Our ESG Framework is driven by our vision to 
“Reimagine spaces” for a sustainable tomorrow for all our stakeholders. On the back of a successful 3-year 
roadmap up to FY2025 and on largely achieving the targets that we had set for ourselves; we have launched a 
new 5-year sustainability roadmap till FY2030, reiterating our commitment to adopt best-in-class sustainability 
practices. These new targets are also aligned with our ESG framework that comprises 3 pillars - Resilient Planet, 
Revitalized Communities and Responsible Business.

Energy and Emissions
We have committed to transition to a net-
zero carbon portfolio by growing the share 
of clean and sustainable energy sources to 
build and operate our properties and offset 
carbon emissions at every stage of our assets’ 
lifecycle. To this end, we target to increase the 
proportion of renewable energy consumption in 
our operational properties to 80% by FY2030. 
Further, in line with our sustainability efforts, 
we design and operate buildings aligned with 
LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental 
Design) requirements certified by the United 
States Green Building Council (USGBC), the 
most widely used green building rating system 
globally and aim to achieve Bureau of Energy 
Efficiency (BEE) certification on energy ratings 
for 75% of the portfolio. To reduce our carbon 
footprint, we are also promoting the use of 
electric vehicles, cycles and cleaner and greener 
fuels across our properties. We are certified 
for ISO 50001, Energy Management System, 
taking another step ahead in creating a robust 
framework towards energy conservation and 
reducing emissions.
Waste Management
We seek to be a zero-waste campus, and we 
minimize, recover and reuse the waste we generate. 
We have partnered with authorized vendors to 
treat hazardous waste and ensure that the waste is 
discarded as per regulatory guidelines. A traceability 
assessment for all the waste generated on our 
campuses is helping us track and reduce the amount 
of operational waste reaching landfills. We launched 
a cigarette waste management program across our 
portfolio, as we continue to focus on diversion of 
waste away from landfills. 
Water Stewardship
We understand the importance of water stewardship 
in urban metropolitan areas where our properties 
are situated. Our goal to achieve water neutrality 
across all our businesses is based on the tenets of 
reducing, reusing, and recycling. In line with this we 
aim to increase the consumption of recycled water by 
20% by FY2030. We remain committed to minimizing 
wastewater discharge and promoting water recycling 
across our office parks. All our assets are equipped 
with Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) and rainwater 
harvesting systems. Sensor-based taps, smart meters 
and other water efficient fixtures have been installed 
to monitor and to reduce water wastage.
Biodiversity
We are mindful of the environmental implications 
of our projects and take all measures required to 
reduce their environmental impact by adhering to 
all regulations. Our goal is to promote and conserve 
biodiversity in the areas in which we operate. Native 
flora and fauna are integrated in all our parks. 
Tree plantation drives across our properties have 
helped increase the urban greenery, further aiding 
in decarbonization. Innovative landscape designs 
comprising of increased share of green walls, native 
greens and biophilic elements are being adopted 
in all our existing and under construction projects.
Resource Efficiency
Key Initiatives taken 
in H1 FY2026
• Air Handling Units across our key 
office parks have been retrofitted with 
Electronically Commutated fans, achieving 
over 40% energy savings and enhancing 
sustainable operations.
• Advanced energy and water smart 
meters have been deployed across our 
major office parks to enable efficient and 
transparent resource monitoring.
• District cooling systems have been 
introduced across multiple blocks at 
Embassy Manyata, improving comfort, 
while reducing energy use and operational 
costs.

Sustainable Supply Chain
ESG performance of Suppliers
We work with 700+ suppliers and contractors 
who are critical to our success and capabilities 
to meet our commitments to our stakeholders. 
We track, monitor and undertake initiatives 
to improve sustainability performance 
across our supply chain by encouraging our 
suppliers to adopt sustainability initiatives 
and disclose their sustainability performance 
transparently. ESG clauses are incorporated 
in our agreements and contracts with major 
suppliers supporting our functions. We 
conduct periodic audits and continuously 
monitor and review their performance  
to ensure ESG compliance across our  
value chain.
Local Sourcing
Localizing supply chains presents a 
significant opportunity to enhance the 
socio-economic well-being of communities 
near our operations, while also reducing our 
carbon footprint. We have defined a 1,000 
km radius around our respective sites to 
evaluate the availability of local materials. To 
increase our share of local sourcing, we have 
developed a ‘Local Sourcing Data Tracker’ 
and incorporated a ‘Local Sourcing Clause’ 
in all our major contracts. Our suppliers 
and contractors are being encouraged to 
understand and initiate tracking of selected 
Scope 3 emissions relevant to their footprint.
Certified Materials
We recognize the importance of using 
green and eco-certified materials and 
prioritize their use. To manage, monitor and 
regulate the certified material usage in our 
portfolio, we have initiated the tracking of 
material certificates and have developed a 
certifications database. We plan to initiate 
usage of EPD (Environmental Product 
Declaration) or HPD (Health Product 
Declaration) materials as well as third-party 
certified wood-based materials and products 
in our portfolio to enhance the sustainability 
aspects of our projects.

Customer 
Centricity
We aim to bring together corporate

public sectors on a common platform 
to discuss and work towards shared 
challenges and visions. Most of our 
education, health and education 
infrastructure CSR projects are 
being carried out in partnership with 
our occupiers under the Corporate 
Connect umbrella. These initiatives 
help us in amplifying our CSR projects 
and aligning our CSR mandates 
We believe that corporate occupier 
engagement and satisfaction 
is critical to the success of our 
business. Several cultural and 
entertainment programs are 
undertaken at our campuses to 
engage our occupiers’ employees 
and foster a sense of culture. We 
have created an ESG occupier 
with our 270+ corporate occupiers, 
thereby promoting long-lasting 
relationships and partnerships. We 
have completed 110+ projects till date 
in partnership with 50+ corporates.
Under corporate connect, we also

that provide opportunities for 
interactive discussions on meaningful 
causes to pursue the common goal 
of sustainable development. Over the 
forum with participation from our 
key occupiers, and we hold periodic

key ESG initiatives. We undertake 
a customer satisfaction (CSAT) 
survey each year to understand and 
improve the occupier satisfaction 
levels with our services and 
facilities. Further, as part of our 
last few years, Embassy has created 
18 such forums that bring together 
like-minded corporates, government 
officials, NGOs and other members 
of the social development sectors to 
contemplate pressing social issues 
that need immediate attention. The 
primary objective of these forums 
is to learn from each other and to 
explore possible synergies in the 
outreach space.

Disclosures
We are committed to maintaining

endeavor to further refine our 
disclosures in sync with global best 
practices. In line with regulatory 
guidelines, we publish quarterly 
financial results and semi-annual 
performance reports as well as an 
annual sustainability report aligned 
with the Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI) framework. In addition, we 
have voluntarily adopted the BRSR 
reporting as per Indian regulator 
SEBI’s ESG reporting guidelines, in 
our efforts to provide transparent 
disclosures comparable across 
Indian entities. We intend to align 
our disclosures to Task Force

taken step forward in this direction 
with continued inclusion of certain 
TCFD disclosures in our ESG report.
We also strive to achieve a 
leadership position in all ESG ratings, 
certifications and assessments that 
we participate in and continuously 
improve our performance by scaling 
up our ongoing ESG programs and 
commitments.
Asset Acquisition and 
Site Selection
We are committed to ensuring 
that our investment evaluation 
criteria take into account relevant 
ESG considerations. For this, we 
have created an ESG checklist, 
and all proposed acquisitions now 
undergo ESG due diligence using 
this checklist which is certified by 
external advisor(s) and presented 
to the Investment committee. 
Additionally, we have strong related 
party safeguards in place for all 
acquisitions. ESG due diligence 
has been undertaken for all of our 
acquisitions including the most 
recent acquisition of Embassy 
Splendid TechZone in Chennai, 
completed in June 2024. Also, for 
all future acquisitions, we aim to 
bring the asset under the purview 
of our net zero commitment within 
5 years post the completion of the 
acquisition.

may otherwise be difficult to conclude satisfactorily.

and Axis Trustee Services Limited (“Trustee”), in 
connection with an order passed by the National

4. On October 03, 2024, SEBI issued an 
administrative warning for non-disclosure of certain 
information(details of the development, changes to

was noted as a non-compliance of Regulation 7(d)

Embassy REIT included goodwill in the computation 
of NAV only to the extent of the corresponding 
deferred tax, ensuring that the net goodwill (i.e., 
goodwill on consolidation less deferred tax on the

 Notes:       
 Measurement of fair values       
 The fair value of investments in SPVs are computed basis the fair value of the underlying investment properties, 
investment properties under development,  property, plant and equipment and capital work-in-progress as at 
30 September 2025 and as at 31 March 2025 along with book values of other assets and liabilities accounted in 
the respective SPV financial statements as at 30 September 2025 and as at 31 March 2025. The fair value of the 
properties as at 30 September 2025 and 31 March 2025 as disclosed above are solely determined by L.Anuradha, 
the independent registered external property valuers appointed under Regulation 21 of REIT regulations, having 
appropriately recognised professional qualifications and recent experience in the location and category of the 
properties being valued in conjunction with value assessment services undertaken by Cushman & Wakefield India 
Private Limited.
 Valuation technique       
 The fair value measurement for all the investment properties, investment properties under development, property 
plant and equipment and capital work-in-progress has been categorized as a Level 3 fair value based on the inputs 
to the valuation technique used.        
 The valuers have followed a Discounted Cash Flow method. The valuation model considers the present value of net 
cash flows to be generated from the respective properties, taking into account the expected rental growth rate, 
vacancy period, occupancy rate, average room rent, lease incentive costs and blended tariff rates. The expected 
net cash flows are discounted using the risk adjusted discount rates. Among other factors, the discount rate 
estimation considers the quality of a building and its location (prime vs secondary), tenant credit quality, lease 
terms, seasonality in sustaining a stable average room rent and occupancy for the hotels.

 Notes:       
 Measurement of fair values:       
 The fair value of investment properties (including assets held for sale), investment properties under development 
(including capital advances); property, plant and equipment (relating to the hotel property in UPPL, MPPL 
and QBPL, and the solar power plant in EEPL); capital work-in-progress (relating to the proposed hotel to be 
developed in ETV assets); intangibles and the investment in GLSP as at 30 September 2025 and 31 March 2025 has 
been determined by L. Anuradha, independent external registered property valuer appointed under Regulation 
21 of REIT regulations, having appropriately recognised professional qualifications and recent experience in the 
location and category of the properties being valued in conjunction with value assessment services undertaken by 
Cushman & Wakefield.
 Valuation technique       
 The fair value measurement for all the investment properties, investment properties under development, property 
plant and equipment, intangibles and capital work-in-progress has been categorized as a Level 3 fair value based 
on the inputs to the valuation technique used.
 The valuers have followed a Discounted Cash Flow method. The valuation model considers the present value of net 
cash flows to be generated from the respective properties, taking into account the expected rental growth rate, 
vacancy period, occupancy rate, average room rent, lease incentive costs and blended tariff rates. The expected 
net cash flows are discounted using the risk adjusted discount rates. Among other factors, the discount rate 
estimation considers the quality of a building and its location (prime vs secondary), tenant credit quality, lease 
terms, seasonality in sustaining a stable average room rent and occupancy for the hotels.

B. EEPL
 (i) Regulatory Proceedings
  The Karnataka Electricity Regulatory

in 2005, 2008 and 2014 granting exemption 
to all solar power generators in Karnataka that 
achieved commercial operation date between 
April 1, 2013 and March 31, 2018 from paying 
certain charges such as, inter-alia, payment of 
wheeling and banking charges, cross subsidy 
surcharges, transmission losses and wheeling 
losses for a period of ten years from the date 
of commissioning. The Commission issued 
an order in 2018 directing cancellation of 
the aforementioned exemption available to 
Karnataka’s power generators, including EEPL. 
Subsequently, EEPL and others have filed writ 
petitions in 2018 in the High Court of Karnataka 
against the State of Karnataka, the Commission, 
Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited, 
Gulbarga Electricity Supply Company Limited 
and Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation 
Limited. The High Court of Karnataka by way of 
an order dated May 24, 2018 has directed interim 
stay on the Commission’s order. In the event of 
cancellation of the aforesaid exemption, EEPL 
would incur an estimated loss of approximately 
H1053.50 million over a ten year period. The 
Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited 
filed an interlocutory application on June 18, 
2018, seeking recalling of order dated May 24, 
2018 of the High Court of Karnataka and the 
Commission has filed common preliminary

 (ii) Other Material Litigation
  EEPL has received a demand notice under 
the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 
(“IBC”) on February 28, 2019 from a third party 
subcontractor, engaged by the parent company 
of a third-party service provider for Embassy 
Energy (“Service Provider”), which was itself 
engaged by the Service Provider as a contractor 
for Embassy Energy. The demand notice alleges 
that unpaid amounts (categorized as operational 
debts) aggregating up to H1,008.1 million are due 
to the sub-contractor directly from EEPL for the 
various works claimed to have been undertaken 
at the site of Embassy Energy, on the basis of 
certain correspondence with EEPL. EEPL has by 
its letter dated March 1, 2019, refuted all such 
claims inter-alia on the basis that the payments 
are due from the Service Provider (and/ or its 
parent entity) to the sub-contractor and not 
from EEPL, and therefore the sub-contractor 
has no claim against EEPL. By its letters 
dated March 18, 2019, the subcontractor has 
responded to the letter from EEPL, denying all 
statements made by EEPL and reiterating that 
the unpaid amounts are due from EEPL, without 
prejudice to any action, including criminal, that 
may be taken under law including the IBC 
against EEPL, the Service Provider, its parent 
entity and certain representatives of these 
entities. EEPL has also written to the Service 
Provider in relation to deficiencies in services 
required to be contractually provided by the 
Service Provider. The Service Provider has 
responded to EEPL denying the allegations in 
such letters. The sub-contractor of the Service 
Provider has filed an application against EEPL 
in October 2019 under Section 9 of IBC before 
the NCLT, Bengaluru claiming debt of H997.59 
million and interest thereon against EEPL. 
Pursuant to a letter dated January 2, 2020, 
the third party sub-contractor served notice of 
hearing in this matter for initiation of insolvency 
proceedings under Section 9 of the IBC before 
the NCLT, Bengaluru. 
  Subsequently, the Service Provider and EEPL 
agreed to a revised prepayment mechanism 
pursuant to a letter dated November 18, 2020. It 
was agreed that upon payment of H7.77 billion, 
all the definitive agreements executed between 
parties, except the operations and management 
agreement, shall be terminated and result in the 
release of the security interest over the EEPL 
assets. Pursuant to a letter dated December 11, 
2020, the entire prepayment amount of H7.77 
billion has been paid by EEPL towards full 
and final settlement and the Service Provider 
has confirmed that there are no dues payable 
under the deferment payment agreement. The 
operations and management agreement with the 
Service Provider was subsequently terminated.
  The NCLT, Bengaluru has disposed off this 
matter on March 8, 2022. The Service Provider 
has filed an appeal against the order of the NCLT 
Bengaluru before the NCLAT, Chennai. The 
NCLAT has dismissed the appeal pursuant to an 
order dated June 16, 2023. Further, an appeal 
has been filed by the Service Provider before 
the Supreme Court of India. Additionally, the 
Service Provider has submitted an application to 
the District Legal Service Authority requesting 
for pre-institution mediation with EEPL and 
the pre-mediation has failed and a non-starter 
report was filed. Further, the Service Provider 
has initiated a suit before the Additional City 
Civil and Sessions Judge, Commercial Court, 
Bengaluru. The matter is currently pending.
 (iii) Criminal Proceedings
  A First Information Report (“FIR”) for offences 
under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, 
1860 was registered by Deonar Police Station 
against EEPL, Mr. Jitendra Virwani, Mr. Karan 
Virwani and another person at the instance of 
a representative of Sterling Wilson Renewable 
Energy Private Limited (“SWREL”). SWREL 
under the FIR has claimed that EEPL has not 
made balance payments to SWREL for its 
services as a third party contractor, thereby 
resulting in loss to SWREL. Further, charge sheet 
was filed on November 2024 before the 47 th 
Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court, Esplanade, 
Mumbai. The matter is currently pending. Mr. 
Jitendra Virwani and Mr. Karan Virwani have also 
filed a Criminal Revision Application before the 
High Court of Bombay for modification of the 
bail conditions. The matter is currently pending.
  EEPL, Mr. Jitendra Virwani and Mr. Karan 
Virwani have filed a criminal writ petition before 
the High Court of Bombay against the State of 
Maharashtra and the representative of SWREL 
praying, inter-alia, to quash and set aside the 
FIR, which was subsequently transferred to

2025, the criminal writ petition was withdrawn 
before the High Court of Bombay. Further, a 
criminal revision application was filed by  EEPL, 
Mr. Jitendra Virwani and Mr. Karan Virwani

15. Risk factors
 Risk related to our organisation and structure
 1. The Portfolio has certain liabilities, which 
if realised may impact the trading price of 
the units, our profitability and our ability to 
make distributions.
 2. We have incurred external debt at Embassy 
REIT level. Additionally, we may incur further 
debt and a significant amount of such future 
debt may be utilised in the operation and 
development of our business. Consequently, 
our cash flows and operating results could be 
adversely affected by required repayments 
or related interest and other risks of our debt 
financing. Our inability to service debt may 
impact distributions to Unitholders.
 3. We do not provide any assurance or guarantee 
of any distributions to the Unitholders. We may 
not be able to make distributions to Unitholders 
and the level of distributions may decrease. Our 
historical distributions may not be indicative of 
future distributions.
 4. The REIT Regulations impose restrictions on 
the investments made by us and require us to 
adhere to certain investment conditions, which 
may limit our ability to acquire and/or dispose 
of assets or explore new opportunities. The 
laws governing REITs in India are evolving and 
relatively untested.
 5. The holding and financing structure of the 
Portfolio may not be tax efficient.
 Risks Related to our business and industry
 1. Our business is dependent on the Indian 
economy and financial stability in Indian 
markets, and any slowdown in the Indian 
economy or in Indian financial markets could 
have a material adverse effect on our business.
 2. We are subject to risks associated with 
pandemics or other public health crisis, which 
could materially and adversely affect us. Due 
to COVID-19, certain tenants at our office parks 
had limited the number of their operating staff 
and hours, while others announced ‘work-from 
home’ measures. The resurgence of COVID-19 
could lead to tenants suspending operations 
at our properties. Since the normalisation of 
COVID-19, there has been tenant uncertainty 
regarding office space needs given evolving 
remote and hybrid working trends which 
began with the COVID-19 pandemic, which 
has resulted in a decreased demand for office 
space in certain places. Our operations and 
financial performance could be materially and 
adversely impacted as the result of the future 
emergence of new variants of COVID-19, or 
another pandemic or other public health crisis, 
and any related shutdowns or other significant 
business disruptions.
 3. We have a limited operating history and may 
not be able to operate our business successfully 
or generate sufficient cash flows to make or 
sustain distributions.
 4. A significant portion of our revenues is derived 
from a limited number of large tenants, 
multinational tenants, tenants in the technology 
and financial services sectors and from a few 
integrated office parks and cities. Any conditions 
that impact these tenants, sectors, parks or 
cities may adversely affect our business, results 
and financial condition.
 5. Tenant leases across our Portfolio are subject 
to the risk of non-renewal, non-replacement or 
early termination. Further, vacant properties 
could be difficult to lease, which could adversely 
affect our revenues.
 6. Our business and profitability are dependent on 
the performance of the commercial real estate 
market in India generally and any fluctuations in 
market conditions may have an adverse impact 
on our financial condition.
 7. As GLSP does not qualify as an Asset SPV 
under the REIT Regulations, it is not required 
to comply with the mandatory distribution 
requirements under the REIT Regulations.
 8. The valuation reports obtained for our Portfolio 
are based on various assumptions and may not 
be indicative of the true value of our assets.
 9. We have in the past recognised impairment 
losses and may be required to record significant 
changes to the earning in the future when we 
review our Portfolio for potential impairment.
 10. Our contingent liabilities could adversely affect 
our financial condition, results of operations 
and cash flows.
 11. We rely on third party operators to successfully 
operate and manage certain Portfolio Assets. 
Our results of operations may be adversely 
affected if we fail to effectively oversee the 
functioning of third-party operators.
 12. Compliance with, and changes in, applicable 
laws (including without limitation environmental 
laws and regulations) could adversely affect 
the development of our properties and our 
financial condition.
 13. If we are unable to maintain relationships with 
other stakeholders in our Portfolio, our financial 
conditions and results of operation may be 
adversely affected.
 14. We may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or 
catastrophic events, including the emergence of 
pandemics, terrorist attacks, extreme weather 
events, natural disasters or other widespread 
health emergencies that could create economic 
and financial disruptions, and could lead 
to operational difficulties (including travel 
limitations) that could impair/impact our ability 
to manage our businesses.
 15. We are exposed to a variety of risks associated 
with safety, security and crisis management.
 16. We may be unable to successfully grow our 
business in new markets in India, which may 
adversely affect our growth, business prospects, 
results of operations and financial condition.
 17. We may be adversely affected if the Asset SPVs 
and/or Investment Entity are unable to obtain, 
maintain or renew all regulatory approvals that 
are required for their respective business.
 18. Some of our Portfolio Assets are located on 
land leased from the MMRDA, MIDC, NOIDA and 
KIADB. The relevant Asset SPVs are required to 
comply with the terms and conditions provided 
in the respective lease agreements with such 
government bodies, failing which MMRDA, 
MIDC, NOIDA or KIADB, as the case may be, 
may, impose penalties, terminate the lease or 
take over the premises.
 19. We have entered into material related party 
transactions, the terms of which may be 
unfavorable to us or could involve conflicts of 
interest. The Manager may face conflicts of 
interests in choosing our service providers, and 
certain service providers may provide services 
to the Manager, Embassy Sponsor or the 
Blackstone Sponsor Group on more favourable 
terms than those payable by us.
 20. Our solar operations are dependent on the 
regulatory and policy environment affecting the 
renewable energy sector in India.
 21. Our Asset SPVs and the Investment Entity are 
subject to ongoing compliance requirements 
under various laws, and there have been certain 
past instances of non-compliance.
 22. Some of our Portfolio Assets are located on 
land notified as SEZs and the Asset SPVs are 
required to comply with the SEZ Act and the 
rules made thereunder.
 23. The title, leasehold rights and development 
rights or other interests over land where the 
Portfolio are located may be subject to legal 
uncertainties and defects, which may interfere 
with our ownership and/or leasehold rights of 
the Portfolio and result in us incurring costs to 
remedy and cure such defects.
 24. There can be no assurance that we will be able 
to successfully complete future acquisitions or 
efficiently manage the assets we have acquired 
or may acquire in the future. Further, any of 
our acquisitions in the future may be subject to 
acquisition related risks.
 25. There may be conflicts of interests between 
the Manager, Embassy Sponsor, the 
Blackstone Sponsor Group, the Blackstone 
Sponsor, the Trustee and/or their respective 
associates/ affiliates.
 26. We may not be able to successfully meet working 
capital or capital expenditure requirements of 
our Portfolio Assets due to the unavailability of 
funding on acceptable terms.
 27. We may invest in under construction real estate 
projects which may be adversely affected by 
delay in completion and cost overruns.
 28. The audit report of our Statutory Auditors on the 
Consolidated Financial Statements may contain 
certain qualifications and matters of emphasis.
 29. Our Portfolio Assets and the Investment Entity 
may be subject to increases in direct expenses 
and other operating expenses. Renovation work, 
repair and maintenance or physical damage to 
the Portfolio Assets and/or the assets of the 
209208
SECTION 05 Half-Yearly Report FY2025-26STATUTORY REPORTS
Statutory Disclosures Section (Contd..)
Investment Entity may disrupt our operations 
and collection of rental income or otherwise 
result in an adverse impact on our financial 
condition and results of operation.
 30. We may be subject to certain restrictive 
covenants under our financing agreements 
that could limit our flexibility in managing our 
business or to use cash or other assets. The 
terms of such financing may limit our ability to 
make distributions to the Unitholders.
 31. Recent disruptions in the financial markets 
and current economic conditions could 
adversely affect our ability to service existing 
indebtedness. We may require additional 
debt financing in order to continue to grow 
our business, which may not be available on 
acceptable terms, or at all.
 32. The ROFO Deed entered into with Embassy 
Sponsor, in respect of certain identified existing 
assets and the potential future asset pipeline, is 
subject to various terms and conditions. Further, 
the Embassy Sponsor has in the past, and may 
in the future, undertake corporate restructuring 
exercises, which may continue to impact the 
potential future asset pipeline under the ROFO 
Deed. For instance, the terms of the ROFO Deed 
are not applicable to Embassy Developments 
Limited, which holds certain potential ROFO 
assets pursuant to restructuring
 33. The brand “Embassy” is owned by Embassy 
Shelters Private Limited and licensed to us. Our 
license to use the “Embassy” trademark and logo 
may be terminated under certain circumstances 
and our ability to use the trademark and logo 
may be impaired. Further, for certain other Asset 
SPVs, we do not have registered trademarks in 
the name of the relevant SPVs.
 34. We operate in a highly competitive environment 
and increased competitive pressure could 
adversely affect our business and the ability of 
the Manager to execute our growth strategy.
 35. We may experience a decline in realised rent 
rates from time to time, which may adversely 
affect our business, results of operations, cash 
flows and distributions.
 36. We may not able to maintain adequate 
insurance to cover all losses we may incur in our 
business operations.
 37. There is outstanding litigation and regulatory 
action involving Embassy Sponsor 
and its Associates that may adversely 
affect our business.
 38. Our business may be adversely affected by the 
illiquidity of real estate investments.
 39. Lease deeds with some of our tenants are 
not adequately stamped or registered, and 
consequently, we may be unable to successfully 
litigate over the said agreements in the future 
and penalties may be imposed on us.
 40. Security and IT risks may disrupt our business, 
result in losses or limit our growth.
 41. Foreign Account Tax Compliance withholding 
may affect payments on the Units for investors.
 42. We expect to be classified as a passive foreign 
investment company for U.S. federal income 
tax purposes, which could result in materially 
adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences 
to U.S. investors in our Units.
 Risks related to our relationships with the 
Sponsors and the Manager
 1. We and parties associated with us are required 
to maintain the eligibility conditions specified 
under Regulation 4 of the REIT Regulations 
as well as the Certificate of Registration on an 
ongoing basis. We may not be able to ensure 
such ongoing compliance by Embassy Sponsor, 
the Blackstone Sponsor, the Manager, the 
Blackstone Sponsor Group and the Trustee, 
which could result in the cancellation of 
our registration.
 2. Our Sponsors will be able to exercise significant 
influence over certain of our activities and the 
interests of the Sponsors may conflict with the 
interests of other Unitholders or the interests of 
the Sponsors may conflict with each other.
 3. Conflicts of interest may arise out of common 
business objectives shared by the Manager, 
Embassy Sponsor, the Blackstone Sponsor, the 
Blackstone Sponsor Group and us.
  Further, we may be subject to potential conflicts 
of interest arising out of our relationship 
with the Sponsor, Sponsor Group and their 
affiliates and the Manager, and may enter into 
transactions with related parties in the future 
and the Manager cannot assure you that such 
potential conflicts of interest will always be 
resolved in favour of Embassy Office Parks REIT.
  Our Manager has adopted the policy on 
related party transactions and conflicts of 
interest to mitigate such potential conflicts of 
interest instances.
 4. Certain principals and employees may be 
involved in and have a greater financial 
interest in the performance of other real 
estate investments, projects and businesses 
of Embassy Group or Blackstone and such 
activities may create conflicts of interest in 
making investment decisions on our behalf.
 5. We depend on the Manager and its personnel 
for our success. We may not find a suitable 
replacement for the Manager if the Investment 
Management Agreement is terminated or if key 
personnel cease to be employed by the Manager 
or otherwise become unavailable to us.
 6. We depend on the Manager to manage 
our business and assets, and our results of 
operations, financial condition and ability 
to make distributions may be harmed if the 
Manager fails to perform satisfactorily, for 
which our recourse may be limited. In addition, 
the Manager provides leasing management 
services to assets held by the Embassy Sponsor, 
and may also provide property or leasing 
management services to third-party entities 
outside the Embassy REIT Assets in the future, 
which may lead to conflicts of interest with 
respect to similar services provided by the 
Manager to assets of the Embassy REIT.
 Risks related to India
 1. Our performance is linked to the stability of 
policies and the political situation in India.
 2. Any downgrading of India’s sovereign debt 
rating by a domestic or international rating 
agency could materially and adversely affect 
our ability to obtain financing and, in turn, our 
business and financial performance.
 3. Significant differences exist between Ind AS 
and other accounting principles, such as IFRS, 
Indian GAAP and U.S. GAAP which may be 
material to your assessment of our financial 
condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 4. It may not be possible for Unitholders to enforce 
foreign judgements.
 5. Tax laws are subject to changes and differing 
interpretations, which may materially 
and adversely affect our operations and 
growth prospects.
 6. Investors may be subject to Indian taxes arising 
out of capital gains on the sale of Units.
 7. Land is subject to compulsory acquisition by 
the government and compensation in lieu of 
such acquisition may be inadequate.
 8. We may be subject to the Competition Act, 
which may require us to receive approvals from 
the Competition Commission of India (CCI) 
prior to undertaking certain transactions.
 9. Our ability to raise funding is dependent on 
our ability to raise capital through a fresh issue 
of Units and or our ability to raise debt on 
acceptable terms. Further, debt securities issued 
by us may not qualify as eligible securities that 
can be held by certain types of investors, and 
certain lenders may be unable to extend loans 
to us due to regulatory and other restrictions, 
which may make it more difficult for us to raise 
funds and may increase the cost of borrowings.
 Risks related to the ownership of the Units
 1. Trusts like Embassy REIT may be dissolved, 
and the proceeds from the dissolution thereof 
may be less than the amount invested by 
the Unitholders.
 2. We are subject to ongoing reporting 
requirements as a listed entity. Requirements 
and other obligations of real estate investment 
trusts postlisting are still evolving. Accordingly, 
the level of ongoing disclosures made to and 
the protections granted to Unitholders may 
be limited as compared to those made to or 
available to the shareholders of a company that 
has listed its equity shares upon a recognised 
stock exchange in India.
 3. Fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Indian 
Rupee with respect to other currencies will 
affect the foreign currency equivalent of the 
value of the Units and any distributions.
 4. Unitholders are unable to request for the 
redemption of their Units.
 5. The Units may experience price and volume 
fluctuations and there may not be an active or 
liquid market for the Units.
211210
SECTION 05 Half-Yearly Report FY2025-26STATUTORY REPORTS
 6. There can be no assurance on the trading price of 
the Units and the price of the Units may decline.
 7. Any future issuance of Units by us or sale of Units 
by Embassy Sponsor or any of other significant 
Unitholders may materially and adversely affect 
the trading price of the Units. The Embassy 
Sponsor has pledged all their Units. We cannot 
assure you that we will not issue further Units 
or that the Unitholders, including the Embassy 
Sponsor, and other significant Unitholders, 
will not dispose of, pledge or otherwise 
encumber their Units.
 8. Our rights and the rights of the Unitholders 
to recover claims against the Manager or the 
Trustee are limited.
 9. NAV per Unit may be diluted if further issues are 
priced below the current NAV per Unit.
 10. Compliance with the European Union Directive 
on Alternative Investment Fund Managers may 
increase administrative and regulatory burdens 
on the Manager and us

reporting of Embassy REIT.

Condensed Standalone Financials 
Report on Review of Condensed Standalone Interim 
Ind AS Financial Statements 
Introduction
1. We have reviewed the accompanying unaudited 
Condensed Standalone Interim Ind AS Financial 
Statements of Embassy Office Parks REIT (the 
“REIT”) which comprise the unaudited condensed 
standalone balance sheet as at September 30, 2025, 
the unaudited condensed standalone statement of 
profit and loss, including other comprehensive income 
and unaudited condensed standalone statement 
of cash flows for the half year ended September 
30, 2025, the unaudited condensed standalone 
statement of changes in Unitholder’s equity for 
the half year ended September 30, 2025, and the 
unaudited Statement of Net Distributable Cash 
Flows of the REIT for the half year ended September 
30, 2025 and a summary of the material accounting 
policies and select explanatory information 
(together hereinafter referred to as the “Condensed 
Standalone Interim Ind AS Financial Statements”).
2. The Manager is responsible for the preparation of 
the Condensed Standalone Interim Ind AS Financial 
Statements in accordance with the Indian Accounting 
Standard 34 (Ind AS 34) “Interim Financial Reporting”, 
specified under Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended) to the extent 
not inconsistent with Securities and Exchange Board 
of India (Real Estate Investment Trusts) Regulations, 
2014, as amended, including any guidelines and 
circulars issued thereunder (together referred as 
the “REIT Regulations”), read with REIT Regulations 
and other accounting principles generally accepted 
in India. The Condensed Standalone Interim Ind AS 
Financial Statements has been approved by the 
Board of Directors of the Manager. Our responsibility 
is to express a conclusion on the Condensed 
Standalone Interim Ind AS Financial Statements 
based on our review.
Scope of Review
3. We conducted our review in accordance with the 
Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410, 
“Review of Interim Financial Information Performed 
by the Independent Auditor of the Entity” issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
This standard requires that we plan and perform the 
review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether 
the Condensed Standalone Interim Ind AS Financial 
Statements is free of material misstatement. A 
review consists of making inquiries, primarily of 
Manager personnel responsible for financial and 
accounting matters, and applying analytical and 
other review procedures. A review is substantially 
less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance 
with Standards on Auditing and consequently does 
not enable us to obtain assurance that we would 
become aware of all significant matters that might 
be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion.

(Acting in its capacity as the Manager of Embassy Office Parks REIT)
12th Floor, Pinnacle Tower, Embassy One,
8 Bellary Road, Ganganagar, R T Nagar,
Bengaluru -560032
Conclusion
4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing 
has come to our attention that causes us to believe 
that the accompanying Condensed Standalone 
Interim Ind AS Financial Statements have not been 
prepared in all material respects in accordance 
with the requirements of Ind AS 34 to the extent 
not inconsistent with REIT Regulations, read with 
REIT Regulations and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India.
Emphasis of Matter
5. We draw attention to note 12(a) of the Condensed 
Standalone Interim Ind AS Financial Statements 
which describes the presentation/classification of 
"Unit Capital" as "Equity" in order to comply with 
the mandatory requirements of the relevant REIT 
Regulations, instead of the applicable requirements 
of Ind AS 32 – Financial Instruments: Presentation.
 Our conclusion is not modiﬁed in respect to 
the above matter.

 Notes
 1) Measurement of fair values
  The fair value of investments in SPVs are computed basis the fair value of the underlying investment properties, 
investment properties under development,  property, plant and equipment and capital work-in-progress as at 
30 September 2025 and as at 31 March 2025 along with book values of other assets and liabilities accounted 
in the respective SPV financial statements as at 30 September 2025 and as at 31 March 2025. The fair value 
of the properties as at 30 September 2025 and 31 March 2025 as disclosed above are solely determined by 
L.Anuradha, the independent registered external property valuers appointed under Regulation 21 of REIT 
regulations, having appropriately recognised professional qualifications and recent experience in the location 
and category of the properties being valued in conjunction with value assessment services undertaken by 
Cushman & Wakefield India Private Limited.
  Valuation technique
  The fair value measurement for all the investment properties, investment properties under development, 
property plant and equipment and capital work-in-progress has been categorized as a Level 3 fair value 
based on the inputs to the valuation technique used.
  The valuers have followed a Discounted Cash Flow method. The valuation model considers the present value 
of net cash flows to be generated from the respective properties, taking into account the expected rental 
growth rate, vacancy period, occupancy rate, average room rent, lease incentive costs and blended tariff rates. 
The expected net cash flows are discounted using the risk adjusted discount rates. Among other factors, the 
discount rate estimation considers the quality of a building and its location (prime vs secondary), tenant 
credit quality, lease terms, seasonality in sustaining a stable average room rent and occupancy for the hotels.
 2) Break up of Net asset value
 3) The Trust holds investment in SPVs which in turn hold the properties. Hence, the breakup of property wise fair 
values has been disclosed in the Condensed Consolidated financial statements.

 iii) Impairment of investments and loans 
in subsidiaries
  Impairment exists when the carrying value 
of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds 
its recoverable amount, which is the higher 
of its fair value less costs of disposal and its 
value in use. The recoverable amounts for the 
investments in subsidiaries are based on value 
in use of the underlying properties. The value in 
use calculation is based on discounted cash flow 
model. The key assumptions used to determine 
the recoverable amount are disclosed and 
further explained in Note 3.
 iv) Fair valuation and disclosures
  SEBI Circulars issued under the REIT 
Regulations require disclosures relating to net 
assets at fair value and total returns at fair 
value (Refer Statement of net assets at fair 
value and Statement of total returns at fair 
value for details).
d) Current versus non-current classification
 The Embassy Office Parks REIT presents assets and 
liabilities in the Condensed Standalone Balance 
Sheet based on current/ non-current classification:
 An asset is treated as current when it is:
 - Expected to be realised or intended to be sold 
or consumed in normal operating cycle;
 - Held primarily for the purpose of trading;
 - Expected to be realised within twelve months 
after the reporting period; or
 - Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from 
being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at 
least twelve months after the reporting period.
 All other assets are classified as non-current.
 A liability is current when:
 - It is expected to be settled in normal 
operating cycle;
 - It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
 - It is due to be settled within twelve months 
after the reporting period; or
 - There is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period.
 The Embassy Office Parks REIT classifies all other 
liabilities as non-current.
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as 
non-current assets and liabilities.
 The operating cycle is the time between the 
acquisition of assets for processing and their 
realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The Embassy 
Office Parks REIT has identified twelve months as its 
operating cycle.
 The Trust has net current liabilities of H4,261.01 
million as at 30 September 2025 mainly due to the 
maturity of Embassy REIT Series IV in September 
2026, Commercial Papers Series D in February 
2026, Commercial Papers Series E and Series F in 
March 2026. Based on the Group's liquidity position 
including undrawn borrowing facilities as well as a 
low leverage of 31% net debt to Gross Asset Value, 
the Trust will be able to refinance its borrowings and 
meet its current obligations as and when they fall due.
e) Measurement of fair values
 A number of the Embassy Office Parks REIT 
accounting policies and disclosures require the 
measurement of fair values, for both financial and 
non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is the 
price that would be received to sell an asset or 
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement 
date. The fair value measurement is based on the 
presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or 
transfer the liability takes place either:
 - In the principal market for the asset or liability; or
 - In the absence of a principal market, in the most 
advantageous market for the asset or liability.
 The principal or the most advantageous market 
must be accessible by the Embassy Office Parks 
REIT. The fair value of an asset or a liability is 
measured using the assumptions that market 
participants would use when pricing the asset or 
liability, assuming that market participants act in 
their economic best interest.
 A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset 
takes into account a market participant’s ability to 
generate economic benefits by using the asset in 
its highest and best use or by selling it to another 
market participant that would use the asset in its 
highest and best use.
 The Embassy Office Parks REIT uses valuation 
techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances 
and for which sufficient data are available to measure 
fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable 
inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
 The Embassy Office Parks REIT has an established 
control framework with respect to the measurement 
of fair values. The Embassy Office Parks REIT engages 
with external valuers for measurement of fair values 
in the absence of quoted prices in active markets.
 While measuring the fair value of an asset or 
liability, the Embassy Office Parks REIT uses market 
observable data as far as possible. Fair values are 
categorised into different levels in a fair value 
hierarchy based on inputs used in the valuation 
techniques as follows-
	 Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities.
	 Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices 
included in Level 1 that are observable for the 
asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or 
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
	 Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that 
are not based on observable market data 
(unobservable inputs).
 When measuring the fair value of an asset or 
a liability, the Embassy Office Parks REIT uses 
observable market data as far as possible. If the 
inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset 
or a liability fall into different levels of the fair 
value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is 
categorised in its entirety in the same level of the 
fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that 
is significant to the entire measurement. The REIT 
recognises transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during 
which the change has occurred.
f) Impairment of non-financial assets
 The Embassy Office Parks REIT assesses, at each 
reporting date, whether there is an indication that 
a non-financial asset other than deferred tax assets 
may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when 
annual impairment testing for an asset is required, 
the Embassy Office Parks REIT estimates the asset’s 
recoverable amount.
 An impairment loss is recognised in the Standalone 
Statement of Profit and Loss if the carrying amount 
of an asset or its cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds 
its recoverable unit. Impairment loss recognised 
in respect of a CGU is allocated first to reduce the 
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the 
CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the 
other assets of the CGU on a pro rata basis. A CGU 
is the smallest identifiable asset REIT that generates 
cash flows that are largely independent from other 
assets and REITs. Impairment losses are recognised 
in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss, 
unless it reverses previous revaluation credited to 
equity, in which case it is charged to equity.
 An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal 
and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In 
determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent 
market transactions are taken into account. For the 
purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot 
be tested individually are grouped together into the 
smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows 
from continuing use that are largely independent of 
the cash inflows of other assets or CGU.
 Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are 
assessed at each reporting date for any indications 
that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. 
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been 
a change in the estimates used to determine the 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss in respect 
of goodwill is not subsequently reversed. In respect 
of other assets, such a reversal is made only to the 
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation, if no impairment 
loss had been recognised.

g) Foreign currency transactions
 Transactions in foreign currencies are translated 
into the respective functional currencies of Embassy 
Office Parks REIT entities at the exchange rates at 
the dates of the transactions.
 Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated into the functional currency 
at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-
monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at 
fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the 
functional currency at the exchange rate when the 
fair value was determined. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities that are measured based on historical cost 
in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange 
rate at the date of the transaction.
 Exchange differences arising on foreign exchange 
transactions settled and from translations during 
the period/year are recognised in the Standalone 
Statement of Profit and Loss of the period /year 
except exchange differences arising from the 
translation of the items which are recognised in OCI.
h) Financial instruments
i) Recognition and initial measurement
 Trade receivables and debt securities issued are initially 
recognised when they are originated. All other financial 
assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised 
when the Embassy Office Parks REIT becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
 A financial asset or financial liability is initially 
measured at fair value (except for trade receivables 
which are initially measured at transaction price) 
plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or 
loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to its acquisition or issue.
ii) Classification and subsequent measurement
 Financial assets
 On initial recognition, a financial asset is 
classified as measured at
 - Amortised cost;
 - Fair value through other comprehensive income 
(FVOCI)– debt instrument;
 - Fair value through other comprehensive income 
(FVOCI)– equity instrument; or
 - Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)
 Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to 
their initial recognition, except if and in the period 
the Embassy Office Parks REIT changes its business 
model for managing financial assets.
 A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it 
meets both of the following conditions and is not 
designated as FVTPL:
 - the asset is held within a business model whose 
objective is to hold assets to collect contractual 
cash flows; and
 - the contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of the principal and interest on 
the principal amount outstanding.
 A debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it 
meets both of the following conditions and is not 
designated as FVTPL:
 - the asset is held within a business model 
whose objective is achieved by both 
collecting contractual cash flows and selling 
financial assets; and
 - the contractual terms of the financial asset give 
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of the principal and interest on 
the principal amount outstanding.
 On initial recognition of an equity instrument that is 
not held for trading, the Embassy Office Parks REIT 
may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes 
in the investment’s fair value in OCI (designated as 
FVOCI – equity investment). This election is made on 
an investment by investment basis.
 All financial assets not classified as measured at 
amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are 
measured at FVTPL. This includes all derivative 
financial assets. On initial recognition, the Embassy 
Office Parks REIT may irrevocably designate a 
financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements 
to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI or at 
FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces 
an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.
 Financial assets: Business model assessment
 The Embassy Office Parks REIT makes an assessment 
of the objective of the business model in which a 
financial asset is held at a portfolio level because 
this best reflects the way the business is managed 
and information is provided to the Management. The 
information considered includes:
 - the stated policies and objectives for the 
portfolio and the operation of those policies in 
practice. These include whether Management’s 
strategy focuses on earning contractual interest 
income, maintaining a particular interest rate 
profile, matching the duration of the financial 
assets to the duration of any related liabilities or 
expected cash outflows or realising cash flows 
through the sale of the assets;
 - how the performance of the portfolio is 
evaluated and reported to the Embassy Office 
Parks REIT’s Management;
 - the risks that affect the performance of the 
business model (and the financial assets held 
within that business model) and how those 
risks are managed;
 - how managers of the business are compensated 
–e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair 
value of the assets managed or the contractual 
cash flows collected; and
 - the frequency, volume and timing of sales of 
financial assets in prior periods, the reasons 
for such sales and expectations about future 
sales activity.
 Transfers of financial assets to third parties in 
transactions that do not qualify for derecognition 
are not considered sales for this purpose, consistent 
with the Embassy Office Parks REIT’s continuing 
recognition of the assets.
 Financial assets that are held for trading or are 
managed and whose performance is evaluated on a 
fair value basis are measured at FVTPL.
 Financial assets: Assessment whether contractual cash 
flows are solely payments of principal and interest
 For the purpose of this assessment, ‘principal’ is 
defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial 
recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration 
for the time value of money and for the credit risk 
associated with the principal amount outstanding 
during a particular period of time and for other 
basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and 
administrative costs), as well as a profit margin.
 In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are 
solely payments of principal and interest, the Embassy 
Office Parks REIT considers the contractual terms of 
the instrument. This includes assessing whether the 
financial asset contains a contractual term that could 
change the timing or amount of contractual cash 
flows such that it would not meet this condition. In 
making this assessment, the Embassy Office Parks 
REIT considers:
 - contingent events that would change the 
amount or timing of cash flows;
 - terms that may adjust the contractual coupon 
rate, including variable interest rate features;
 - prepayment and extension features; and
 - terms that limit the Embassy Office Parks REIT’s 
claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. 
non – recourse features)
 A prepayment feature is consistent with the solely 
payment of principal and interest criterion if the 
prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid 
amounts of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding, which may include reasonable 
additional compensation for early termination 
of the contract. Additionally, for a financial asset 
acquired at a significant discount or premium to its 
contractual par amount, a feature that permits or 
requires prepayment at an amount that substantially 
represents the contractual par amount plus accrued 
(but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also 
include reasonable additional compensation for 
early termination) is treated as consistent with this 
criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is 
insignificant at initial recognition.

 Financial assets: Subsequent measurement and gains and losses
Financial assets at FVTPL These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including 
any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss.
Financial assets at 
amortised cost
These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest 
income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit 
or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.
Debt instruments at FVOCI These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income under the 
effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are 
recognised in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On 
derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss. 
Equity instruments at 
FVOCI
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as 
income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of 
the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are 
not reclassified to profit or loss.
 Financial liabilities: Classification, subsequent 
measurement and gains and losses
 Financial liabilities are classified as measured at 
amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is 
classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held for 
trading, or it is a derivative or it is designated as 
such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at 
FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains 
and losses, including any interest expense, are 
recognised in profit or loss. Other financial liabilities 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. Interest expense and 
foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in 
profit and loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is 
also recognised in profit and loss.
iii) Derecognition
 Financial assets
 The Embassy Office Parks REIT derecognises a 
financial asset when the contractual rights to the 
cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it 
transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash 
flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the 
risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset 
are transferred or in which the Embassy Office Parks 
REIT neither transfers nor retains substantially all 
of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not 
retain control of the financial asset.
 If the Embassy Office Parks REIT enters into transactions 
whereby it transfers assets recognised in its Standalone 
Balance Sheet but retains either all or substantially all 
of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the 
transferred assets are not derecognised.
 Financial liabilities
 The Embassy Office Parks REIT derecognises a 
financial liability when its contractual obligations are 
discharged or cancelled, or expired.
 The Embassy Office Parks REIT also derecognises 
a financial liability when its terms are modified 
and the cash flows under the modified terms are 
substantially different. In this case, a new financial 
liability based on the modified terms is recognised 
at fair value. The difference between the carrying 
amount of the financial liability extinguished and 
the new financial liability with modified terms is 
recognised in profit and loss.
iv) Offsetting
 Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and 
the net amount presented in the Standalone Balance 
Sheet when, and only when, the Embassy Office 
Parks REIT currently has a legally enforceable right 
to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle 
them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle 
the liability simultaneously.
i) Impairment of financial assets
 Financial assets
 The Embassy Office Parks REIT recognises loss 
allowances for expected credit losses on:
 - financial assets measured at amortised cost; and
 - financial assets measured at FVTOCI- 
debt investments
 At each reporting date, the Embassy Office Parks 
REIT assesses whether financial assets carried at 
amortised cost and debt securities at FVTOCI are 
credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ 
when one or more events that have a detrimental 
impact on the estimated future cash flows of the 
financial asset have occurred.
 Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired 
includes the following observable data:
 - significant financial difficulty of the 
borrower or issuer
 - a breach of contract such as a default or being 
past due for 180 days or more
 - the restructuring of a loan or advance by the 
Embassy Office Parks REIT on terms that 
the Embassy Office Parks REIT would not 
consider otherwise
 - it is probable that the borrower will enter 
bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation or
 - the disappearance of an active market for a 
security because of financial difficulties
 The Embassy Office Parks REIT measures loss 
allowances at an amount equal to lifetime expected 
credit losses, except for the following, which are 
measured as 12 months expected credit losses:
 - debt securities that are determined to have low 
credit risk at the reporting date; and
 - other debt securities and bank balances 
for which credit risk (i.e. the risk of default 
occurring over the expected life of the financial 
instrument) has not increased significantly 
since initial recognition.
 Loss allowances for trade receivables are 
always measured at an amount equal to lifetime 
expected credit losses.
 Lifetime expected credit losses are the expected 
credit losses that result from all possible default 
events over the expected life of a financial instrument.
 12-month expected credit losses are the portion 
of expected credit losses that result from default 
events that are possible within 12 months after the 
reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected 
life of the instrument is less than 12 months).
 In all cases, the maximum period considered when 
estimating expected credit losses is the maximum 
contractual period over which the Embassy Office 
Parks REIT is exposed to credit risk.
 When determining whether the credit risk of a 
financial asset has increased significantly since initial 
recognition and when estimating expected credit 
losses, the Embassy Office Parks REIT considers 
reasonable and supportable information that is 
relevant and available without undue cost or effort. 
This includes both quantitative and qualitative 
information and analysis, based on the Embassy 
Office Parks REIT’s historical experience and 
informed credit assessment and including forward-
looking information.
 The Embassy Office Parks REIT assumes that 
the credit risk on a financial asset has increased 
significantly if it is more than 30 days past due.
 The Embassy Office Parks REIT considers a financial 
asset to be default when:
 - the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit 
obligations to the Embassy Office Parks REIT 
in full, without recourse by the Embassy Office 
Parks REIT to actions such as realising security 
(if any is held); or
 - the financial asset is 180 days or more past due 
without any security
 Measurement of expected credit losses: Expected 
credit losses are a probability-weighted estimate 
of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the 
present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference 
between the cash flows due to the Embassy Office 
Parks REIT and the cash flows that the Embassy 
Office Parks REIT expects to receive).
 Presentation of allowance for expected credit 
losses in the balance sheet: Loss allowances for 
financial assets measured at amortised cost are 
deducted from the gross carrying amount of the 
assets. For debt securities at FVTOCI, the loss 
allowance is charged to profit and loss account and 
is recognised in OCI.
 Write-off: The gross carrying amount of a financial 
asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the 
extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. 
This is generally the case when the Embassy Office 
Parks REIT determines that the debtor does not have 
assets or sources of income that could generate

Condensed Standalone Financial Statements 
Notes to the Condensed Standalone Financial Statements
(all amounts in H million unless otherwise stated)
Condensed Standalone Financial Statements 
Notes to the Condensed Standalone Financial Statements
(all amounts in H million unless otherwise stated)
sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to 
write-off. However, financial assets that are written 
off could still be subject to enforcement activities 
in order to comply with the Embassy Office Parks 
REIT’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.
 Majority of the financial assets of the Embassy Office 
Parks REIT pertains to loans to subsidiaries and other 
receivables. Considering the nature of business, the 
Embassy Office Parks REIT does not foresee any 
credit risk on its loans and other receivables which 
may cause an impairment. Also, Embassy Office Parks 
REIT does not have any past history of significant 
impairment of loans and other receivables.
j) Financial guarantee contracts
 Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as 
a financial liability at the time the guarantee is 
issued. The liability is initially measured at fair value 
and subsequently at the higher of the amount 
of loss allowance determined as per impairment 
requirements of Ind AS 109 and the amount 
recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative 
amount of income recognised in accordance with 
the principles of Ind AS 115.
 The fair value of financial guarantees is determined 
as the present value of the difference in net cash 
flows between the contractual payments under the 
debt instrument and the payments that would be 
required without the guarantee, or the estimated 
amount that would be payable to a third party for 
assuming the obligations.
k) Revenue recognition
 Revenue is recognised when recovery of the 
consideration is probable and the amount of revenue 
can be measured reliably.
 Recognition of dividend income and interest 
income
 Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on 
the date on which the Embassy Office Parks REIT’s 
right to receive payment is established.
 Interest income is recognised using the effective 
interest method. The ‘effective interest rate’ is the rate 
that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts 
through the expected life of the financial instrument 
to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset.
 In calculating interest income, the effective interest 
rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of 
the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired). 
However, for financial assets that have become 
credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest income is calculated by applying the 
effective interest rate to the amortised cost of 
the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-
impaired, then the calculation of interest income 
reverts to the gross basis.
l) Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures
 The Trust accounts for its investments in subsidiaries 
and joint ventures at cost less accumulated impairment 
losses (if any) in its Condensed Standalone Financial 
Statements. Investments accounted for at cost 
are accounted for in accordance with Ind AS 105, 
Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations, when they are classified as held for sale.
m) Borrowing costs
 Interest expense is recognised using the effective 
interest method. The ‘effective interest rate’ is the 
rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash 
payments through the expected life of the financial 
instrument to the amortised cost of the financial 
liability. In calculating interest expense, the effective 
interest rate is applied to the amortised cost of the 
liability. Other borrowing costs are recognised as an 
expense in the period in which they are incurred.
n) Taxation
 Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. 
Income tax expense is recognised in the Standalone 
Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent it 
relates to items directly recognised in equity or in 
other comprehensive income.
(i) Current tax:
 Current tax comprises the expected tax payable 
or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the 
period/year and any adjustment to the tax payable 
or receivable in respect of previous years. The 
amount of current tax reflects the best estimate 
of the tax amount expected to be paid or received 
after considering the uncertainty, if any, related to 
income taxes. It is measured using tax rates (and 
tax laws) enacted or substantively enacted by the 
reporting date.
 Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if there 
is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised 
amounts, and it is intended to realise the asset and 
settle the liability on a net basis or simultaneously.
(ii) Deferred tax:
 Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the 
corresponding amounts used for taxation purposes. 
Deferred tax is also recognised in respect of carried 
forward tax losses and tax credits. Deferred tax is 
not recognised for:
 - Temporary differences arising on the initial 
recognition of assets and liabilities in a 
transaction that is not a business combination 
and that affects neither accounting nor taxable 
profit or loss at the time of the transaction;
 - Taxable temporary differences arising on initial 
recognition of goodwill.
 Deferred income tax asset are recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable profits 
will be available against which they can be used. The 
existence of unused tax losses is strong evidence that 
future taxable profit may not be available. Therefore, 
in case of a history of recent losses, the Embassy 
Office Parks REIT recognises a deferred tax asset only 
to the extent that it has sufficient taxable temporary 
differences or there is convincing other evidence that 
sufficient taxable profit will be available against which 
such deferred tax asset can be realised.
 Deferred tax assets – unrecognised or recognised, are 
reviewed at each reporting date and are recognised/
reduced to the extent that it is probable/no longer 
probable respectively that the related tax benefit 
will be realised.
 Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply to the period when the asset 
is realised or the liability is settled, based on the 
tax rate (and tax laws) that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the reporting date.
 The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax 
consequences that would follow from the manner 
in which the Embassy Office Parks REIT expects, at 
the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying 
amount of its assets and liabilities.
 Tax impact of timing difference which arise during 
the tax holiday period are recognised only to the 
extent of those differences which are reversed after 
the tax holiday period.
o) Provisions and contingencies
 The Embassy Office Parks REIT recognises a 
provision when there is a present obligation (legal 
or constructive) as a result of a past obligating event 
that probably requires an outflow of resources and a 
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. A disclosure for a contingent liability is 
made when there is a possible obligation or a present 
obligation that may, but probably will not, require 
an outflow of resources. Where there is a possible 
obligation or a present obligation that the likelihood 
of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or 
disclosure is made.
 Provisions for onerous contracts, i.e. contracts 
where the expected unavoidable costs of meeting 
the obligations under the contract exceed the 
economic benefits expected to be received under it, 
are recognised when it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will be 
required to settle a present obligation as a result of 
an obligating event, based on a reliable estimate of 
such obligation.
 If the effect of the time value of money is material, 
provisions are discounted.
p) Operating segments
 The objectives of Embassy REIT are to undertake 
activities in accordance with the provisions of the 
SEBI REIT Regulations and the Trust Deed. The 
principal activity of Embassy REIT is to own and 
invest in rent or income generating real estate and 
related assets in India.
 The Board of Directors of the Manager allocate 
the resources and assess the performance of the 
Trust, thus are the Chief Operating Decision Maker 
(CODM). In accordance with the requirements 
of Ind AS 108 - "Segment Reporting", the CODM 
monitors the operating results of the business as a 
single segment, hence no separate segment needs 
to be disclosed. As the Embassy Office Parks 
REIT operates only in India, hence no separate 
geographical segment is disclosed.

q) Cash and cash equivalents
 Cash and cash equivalents in the Standalone 
Balance Sheet comprises of cash at banks and on 
hand, deposits held at call with bank or financial 
institutions, other short-term, highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months 
or less that are readily convertible to known amounts 
of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk 
of changes in value.
r) Cash distributions to Unitholders
 The Trust recognises a liability to make cash 
distributions to Unitholders when the distribution 
is authorised and a legal obligation has been 
created. As per the REIT Regulations, a distribution 
is authorised when it is approved by the Board of 
Directors of the Manager. A corresponding liability 
in the form of dividend and interest is recognised 
directly in other equity and distribution in the form 
of repayment of capital is recognised directly on the 
face of balance sheet.
s) Statement of Cash flows
 Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, 
whereby net profit before tax is adjusted for the 
effects of transactions of a non-cash nature and any 
deferrals or accruals of past or future cash receipts or 
payments. The cash flows from operating, investing 
and financing activities of the Embassy Office Parks 
REIT are segregated.
 For the purpose of the Statement of Cash Flow, cash 
and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term 
deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank 
overdrafts as they are considered an integral part of 
the Embassy Office Parks REIT’s cash management.
t) Earnings per unit
 The basic earnings per unit is computed by dividing 
the net profit/ (loss) attributable to the unitholders 
of the REIT by the weighted average number of 
units outstanding during the reporting period. The 
number of units used in computing diluted earnings/ 
(loss) per unit comprises the weighted average units 
considered for deriving basic earnings/ (loss) per 
unit and also the weighted average number of units 
which could have been issued on the conversion of 
all dilutive potential units.
 Dilutive potential units are deemed converted as of 
the beginning of the reporting date, unless they have 
been issued at a later date. In computing diluted 
earnings per unit, only potential equity units that are 
dilutive and which either reduces earnings per share 
or increase loss per units are included.
u) Earnings before finance costs, impairment loss and 
tax
 The Embassy Office Parks REIT has elected to present 
earnings before finance cost, impairment loss and tax 
as a separate line item on the face of the Standalone 
Statement of Profit and Loss. The Embassy Office 
Parks REIT measures earnings before finance cost, 
impairment loss and tax on the basis of profit/(loss) 
from continuing operations. In its measurement, the 
Embassy Office Parks REIT does not include finance 
costs, impairment loss and tax expense.
v) Distribution Policy
 Under the provisions of the REIT Regulations, 
Embassy Office Parks REIT is required to distribute 
to the Unitholders not less than ninety percent of 
the net distributable cash flows (‘NDCF’) of Embassy 
Office Parks REIT. The NDCF was calculated in 
accordance with the REIT Regulations and in the 
manner provided in the NDCF framework defined 
by the Manager. The Manager had made certain 
clarificatory amendments to the NDCF framework 
under the Distribution Policy to ensure that 
there is no ambiguity in computing the NDCF at 
Embassy REIT and SPV/Holdco level. The amended 
framework was approved by a special majority in the 
Unitholder’s Meeting held on 8 July 2021 and was 
effective from 1 April 2021.
 In order to promote standardisation of framework for 
computing NDCF, a revised framework was defined 
by SEBI vide master circular no. SEBI/HO/DDHS-
PoD-2/P/CIR/2024/43 dated 15 May 2024. The 
amended framework was approved by the Board of 
Directors at their meeting held on 2 February 2024. 
This framework was applicable with effect from 1 
April 2024 and accordingly, Embassy Office Parks 
REIT had computed the NDCF for the previous year. 
Further, SEBI has amended the NDCF framework vide 
SEBI master circular no. SEBI/HO/DDHS-PoD-2/P/
CIR/2025/99 dated 11 July 2025 w.e.f 1 April 2025. 
In accordance with this circular, Embassy Office 
Parks REIT along with its SPVs, subject to applicable 
provisions in the Companies Act, 2013, needs to 
ensure that minimum 90% distribution of NDCF 
be met for a given financial year on a cumulative 
periodic basis. The distributions shall be declared 
and paid once every quarter in every financial year.
 The aforesaid net distributable cash flows are made 
available to Embassy Office Parks REIT in the form 
of (i) Interest paid on Shareholder Debt provided 
by Embassy Office Parks REIT to the SPV’s/Holding 
Company, (ii) Principal repayment of Shareholder 
Debt, (iii) Dividend declared by the SPVs/Holding 
Company and (iv) Proceeds from sale of any 
Embassy REIT assets.
w) Statement of net assets at fair value
 The disclosure of Statement of Net Assets at Fair 
value comprises of the fair values of the properties 
held by Asset SPVs and the HoldCo as well as 
book values of the total liabilities and other assets 
of the Trust. The fair value of the property held 
by Asset SPVs and HoldCo are reviewed semi-
annually by the independent property valuer taking 
into consideration market conditions existing at 
the reporting date, and other generally accepted 
market practices. The independent valuer is leading 
independent appraiser with a recognised and 
relevant professional qualification and experience.

(a) The recoverable amounts of the investments in subsidiaries have been computed based on value in use of the 
underlying properties, computed semi-annually in March and September of each financial year. The value in use 
is determined by L Anuradha, independent external property valuers appointed under Regulation 21 of REIT 
regulations, having appropriately recognised professional qualifications and recent experience in the location and 
category of the properties being valued in conjunction with value assessment services undertaken by Cushman & 
Wakefield India Private Limited on discounted cash flow method.

(a) Terms/rights attached to Units
 The Trust has only one class of Units. Each Unit represents an undivided beneficial interest in the Trust. Each 
holder of Units is entitled to one vote per unit. The Unitholders have the right to receive at least 90% of the Net 
Distributable Cash Flows of the Trust at least once in every six months in each financial year in accordance with the 
REIT Regulations. The Board of Directors of the Manager approves distributions to Unitholders. The distribution 
will be in proportion to the number of Units held by the Unitholders. The Trust declares and pays distributions 
in Indian Rupees.
 Under the provisions of the REIT Regulations, Embassy Office Parks REIT is required to distribute to Unitholders 
not less than 90% of the net distributable cash flows of Embassy Office Parks REIT for each financial year. 
Accordingly, a portion of the Unitholders’ funds contains a contractual obligation of the Trust to pay cash to 
the Unitholders. Thus, in accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 32 – Financial Instruments: Presentation, 
the Unit Capital should have been classified as compound financial instrument which contains both equity and 
liability components. However, Paragragh 4.2.3 of Chapter 4 of the SEBI master circular no. SEBI/HO/DDHS-PoD-
2/P/CIR/2025/99 dated 11 July 2025 issued under the REIT Regulations, require the Unit Capital in entirety to 
be presented/classified as “Equity”, which is at variance from the requirements of Ind AS 32. In order to comply 
with the aforesaid SEBI requirements, the Embassy Office Parks REIT has presented unit capital as equity in these 
financial statements. Consistent with Unitholders’ funds being classified as equity, the distributions to Unitholders 
in the form of interest and dividend is presented in Statement of Changes in Unitholders' Equity and distribution 
to Unitholder in the form of repayment of capital is presented as a seperate line item on face of balance sheet and 
not as finance cost. In line with the above, the dividend payable to Unitholders is recognised as liability when the 
distributions are approved by the Board of Directors of the Investment Manager.

 Basic EPU amounts are calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) for the period attributable to Unitholders by the 
weighted average number of units outstanding during the period. Diluted EPU amounts are calculated by dividing 
the profit/(loss) attributable to unitholders by the weighted average number of units outstanding during the 
period plus the weighted average number of units that would be issued on conversion of all the potential dilutive 
instruments into unit capital.
 The following reflects the profit/(loss) and unit data used in the basic and diluted EPU computation.
 * The Trust does not have any outstanding dilutive potential instruments.

master circular no.SEBI/HO/DDHS-PoD-2/P/CIR/2025/99, dated 11 July 2025.
36 SEBI has issued a show cause notice to Embassy Office Parks Management Services Private Limited (‘EOPMSPL’ 
or ‘the Manager’) and Axis Trustee Services Limited (‘Trustee’) of Embassy REIT in the matter of ‘fit and proper’ 
criteria of the erstwhile Chief executive officer of the Manager, with respect to certain delays in disclosures and 
for not ensuring proper compliance with the SEBI REIT Regulations, for which Manager has filed a settlement 
application. On October 13, 2025, the Manager received a demand notice from SEBI for settlement of the above 
matter. The Manager remitted the amount to SEBI on October 16, 2025.
 SEBI sought comments from the Management of Embassy REIT pursuant to complaints sent by unitholders to 
SEBI regarding certain transactions. The Management has provided the requisite responses to SEBI and no further 
communications have been received till date from SEBI.
 SEBI had also sought comments from the Management of Embassy REIT pursuant to a complaint received from 
Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy Limited (SWREL) in connection with certain unpaid amounts alleged to be 
due from Embassy-Energy Private Limited, an SPV of Embassy REIT and also alleged non-compliance with SEBI 
REIT Regulations with respect to “fit and proper” criteria and non-disclosure of material information in connection 
with the civil and criminal litigation matters pending before various judicial authorities and asking to take regulatory 
action. The Management has provided the requisite response to SEBI. SWREL raised a complaint on the SEBI 
SCORES portal of Embassy REIT on 14 July 2025, regarding the same matter. Embassy REIT has responded, and 
the complaint is disposed on the SEBI SCORES portal. The Manager is in continued correspondence with SEBI in

Report on Review of Condensed Consolidated Interim 
Ind AS Financial Statements
The Board of Directors
Embassy Office Parks Management Services Private Limited (“the Manager”)
(Acting in its capacity as the Manager of Embassy Office Parks REIT)
12th Floor, Pinnacle Tower, Embassy One,
8 Bellary Road, Ganganagar, R T Nagar,
Bengaluru -560032
Introduction
1. We have reviewed the accompanying unaudited 
condensed consolidated interim Ind AS financial 
statements of Embassy Office Parks REIT (the 
“REIT”), its subsidiaries and a Joint venture (together 
referred as “the Group”), which comprise the 
unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet 
as at September 30, 2025, the unaudited condensed 
consolidated statement of profit and loss, including 
other comprehensive income and unaudited 
condensed consolidated statement of cash flows 
for the half year ended September 30, 2025, the 
unaudited condensed consolidated statement of 
changes in Unitholder’s equity for the half year ended 
September 30, 2025 and the unaudited statement of 
Net Distributable Cash Flows of the REIT and each 
of its subsidiaries for the half year ended September 
30, 2025 and a summary of the material accounting 
policies and select explanatory information 
(together hereinafter referred to as the “Condensed 
Consolidated Interim Ind AS Financial Statements”).
2. The Manager is responsible for the preparation of the 
Condensed Consolidated Interim Ind AS Financial 
Statements in accordance with the Indian Accounting 
Standard 34 (Ind AS 34) “Interim Financial Reporting”, 
specified under Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, to the extent 
not inconsistent with Securities and Exchange Board 
of India (Real Estate Investment Trusts) Regulations, 
2014, as amended, including any guidelines and 
circulars issued thereunder (together referred as 
the “REIT Regulations”), read with REIT Regulations 
and other accounting principles generally accepted 
in India. The Condensed Consolidated Interim Ind 
AS Financial Statements has been approved by the 
Board of Directors of the Manager. Our responsibility 
is to express a conclusion on the Condensed 
Consolidated Interim Ind AS Financial Statements 
based on our review.
Scope of Review
3. We conducted our review in accordance with the 
Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410, 
“Review of Interim Financial Information Performed 
by the Independent Auditor of the Entity” issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
This standard requires that we plan and perform the 
review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether 
the Condensed Consolidated Interim Ind AS Financial 
Statements is free of material misstatement. A 
review consists of making inquiries, primarily of 
Manager personnel responsible for financial and 
accounting matters, and applying analytical and 
other review procedures. A review is substantially 
less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance 
with Standards on Auditing and consequently does 
not enable us to obtain assurance that we would 
become aware of all significant matters that might 
be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion.

Statements includes the financial information of the

Conclusion
5. Based on our review conducted as above and based 
on the consideration of the review reports of the 
other auditors referred to in paragraph 7 below, 
nothing has come to our attention that causes 
us to believe that the accompanying Condensed 
Consolidated Interim Ind AS Financial Statements 
have not been prepared in all material respects in 
accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 34 to 
the extent not inconsistent with REIT Regulations, 
read with  REIT Regulations and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India.
Emphasis of Matter
6. (a) We draw attention to note 43(iv) to the 
Condensed Consolidated Interim Ind AS 
Financial Statements which refers to the 
uncertainty in relation to two cases pending with 
High Court of Karnataka, as regards property 
tax demand aggregating to H  3,124.96 million as 
at September 30, 2025, in MPPL. Based on legal 
opinions obtained by the Group and pending 
outcome of such legal matter no provision 
has been made in these Condensed Interim 
Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements.
 (b) We draw attention to note 19(a) of the 
Condensed Consolidated Interim Ind AS 
Financial Statements which describes the 
presentation/classification of "Unit Capital" 
as "Equity" in order to comply with the 
requirements of the relevant REIT Regulations, 
instead of the applicable requirements of Ind 
AS 32 – Financial Instruments: Presentation.
  Our conclusion is not modiﬁed in respect to 
the above matters.

Ind AS Financial Statements included in

A) Statement of Net Assets at fair value 
 Notes:
1) Measurement of fair values:
 The fair value of investment properties (including assets held for sale), investment properties under development 
(including capital advances); property, plant and equipment (relating to the hotel property in UPPL, MPPL and QBPL, 
and the solar power plant in EEPL); capital work-in-progress (relating to the proposed hotel to be developed in 
ETV assets); intangibles, investment in GLSP as at 30 September 2025 and 31 March 2025 has been determined by 
L. Anuradha, independent external registered property valuer appointed under Regulation 21 of REIT regulations, 
having appropriately recognised professional qualifications and recent experience in the location and category of 
the properties being valued in conjunction with value assessment services undertaken by Cushman & Wakefield.
 Valuation technique
 The fair value measurement for all the investment properties, investment properties under development, property 
plant and equipment, intangibles and capital work-in-progress has been categorized as a Level 3 fair value based 
on the inputs to the valuation technique used.
 The valuers have followed a Discounted Cash Flow method. The valuation model considers the present value of net 
cash flows to be generated from the respective properties, taking into account the expected rental growth rate, 
vacancy period, occupancy rate, average room rent, lease incentive costs and blended tariff rates. The expected 
net cash flows are discounted using the risk adjusted discount rates. Among other factors, the discount rate 
estimation considers the quality of a building and its location (prime vs secondary), tenant credit quality, lease 
terms, seasonality in sustaining a stable average room rent and occupancy for the hotels.

Assets at Fair Value

PoD-2/P/CIR/2025/99
(all amounts in H million unless otherwise stated)
2) Property wise break up of Fair value of Assets as at 30 September 2025 is as follows:  For the purpose of fair valuation of assets, the Embassy Office Parks Group has fair valued its investment properties 
(including assets held for sale), investment properties under development (including capital advances), property, 
plant and equipment (relating to the hotel property in UPPL, MPPL and QBPL and the solar power plant in EEPL); 
capital work-in-progress (relating to the proposed hotel to be developed in ETV assets); intangibles and the 
investment in GLSP.
 ** Fair value of equity investments in GLSP has been done based on equity valuation method proportionate to 
stake held in GLSP.
 *** Other assets at book value include Goodwill of H33,524.26 million (31 March 2025: H34,100.87 million) on book 
value basis (net off impairment loss). The Goodwill mainly arises on account of requirement to value individual 
assets and liabilities acquired on business combination at fair values as well as the requirement to recognise 
deferred tax liability of H33,524.26 million (31 March 2025: H34,100.87 million), calculated as a difference between 
the tax effect of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Goodwill has been restricted 
to the extent of deferred tax liability.
 Notes:
 (i) Other assets at book value includes cash and cash equivalents, debt investments in GLSP and other working 
capital balances which are not factored in the discounted cashflow method used in determining the fair value 
of investment properties, investment properties under development, property, plant and equipment, capital 
work-in-progress and intangibles.
 (ii) Fair value of liabilities considered for computing the NAV equals the book value of such liabilities, except 
in case where the outflow arising out of the liabilities have already been considered by the valuer while 
computing the fair value of assets or netted off with the corresponding assets.

 Statement of compliance to Ind-AS
 These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
for the half year ended 30 September 2025 are the 
financial statements of the Embassy Office Parks 
Group and have been prepared in accordance with 
Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) 34 "Interim 
Financial Reporting" as defined in Rule 2(1)(a) of 
the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) 
Rules, 2015, to the extent not inconsistent with 
REIT regulations.
 ESNP was acquired on 3 June 2024 by Embassy 
REIT. ESNP has been consolidated from 1 June 2024, 
a date close to the acquisition date, as there are no 
significant transactions or events that have occurred 
between 1 June 2024 and 3 June 2024 and the effect 
thereof is not considered to be material to the results 
for the half year ended 30 September 2024.
 The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
have been prepared using uniform accounting 
policies for like transactions and other events in 
similar circumstances. The financial statements of 
all the SPVs and the Trust used for the purpose of 
consolidation are drawn up to the same reporting 
date i.e. 30 September 2025.
 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
 New and amended standards
 The accounting policies adopted and methods of 
computation followed are consistent with those 
of the previous financial year, except for items 
disclosed below:
 Ind AS 21 - The Effects of Changes in Foreign 
Exchange Rates
 The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has issued a 
notification dated 7 May 2025 for amendments to Ind 
AS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange 
Rates which clarifies on the accounting and disclosure 
requirements where currency is not exchangeable 
into another currency. These amendments are 
applicable with effect from 1 April 2025.
 The above amendments are not relevant or do not 
have an impact on the Condensed Consolidated 
Financial Statements of the Group. The Group has 
not early adopted any standard, interpretation 
or amendment that has been issued but is 
not yet effective.
 Basis of Consolidation
 (i) Subsidiaries
  The Embassy Office Parks Group consolidates 
entities which it owns or controls. The 
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
comprise the financial statements of the 
Embassy Office Parks REIT and its subsidiary 
SPVs as disclosed in Note 1. Control exists 
when the parent has power over the entity, is 
exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from 
its involvement with the entity and has the 
ability to affect those returns by using its power 
over the entity. Power is demonstrated through 
existing rights that give the ability to direct 
relevant activities, those which significantly 
affect the entity’s returns. Subsidiaries are 
consolidated from the date control commences 
until the date control ceases.
  The procedure for preparing Condensed 
Consolidated Financial Statements of the 
Embassy Office Parks Group are stated below:
  a) The Condensed Consolidated Financial 
Statements have been prepared using the 
principles of consolidation as per Ind AS 
110 – Consolidated Financial Statements, to 
the extent applicable.
  b) Goodwill is recognised in the Condensed 
Consolidated Financial Statements at the 
excess of cost of investment over share 
of fair value of net assets acquired on the 
date of acquisition.
  c) The Condensed Consolidated Financial 
Statements of the Embassy Office Parks 
Group are consolidated on a line-by-
line basis and intragroup balances and 
transactions for assets and liabilities, equity, 
income, expenses and cash flows between 
entities of the Embassy Office Parks Group 
are eliminated in full upon consolidation.
  d) Non-controlling interests in the net assets 
(excluding goodwill) of consolidated 
subsidiaries are identified separately from 
the equity attributable to shareholders of 
the Company. The interest of non-controlling 
shareholders may be initially measured 
either at fair value or at the non-controlling 
interests’ proportionate share of the fair 
value of the acquiree’s identifiable net 
assets. The choice of measurement basis is 
made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis.
 (ii) Interests in joint arrangements
  A joint arrangement is an arrangement of which 
two or more parties have joint control. Joint 
control is the contractually agreed sharing of 
control of an arrangement, which exists only when 
decisions about the relevant activities require the 
unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
  A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby 
the parties that have joint control of the 
arrangement have rights to the net assets of the 
arrangement. The results of joint ventures are 
incorporated in these Condensed Consolidated 
Financial Statements using the equity method 
of accounting as described below:
  Under the equity method of accounting, the 
investments are initially recognised at cost on 
the date of acquisition and adjusted thereafter 
to recognize the Embassy Office Parks 
Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits 
or losses of the investee in profit and loss, and 
Embassy Office Parks Group’s share of other 
comprehensive income of the investee in other 
comprehensive income.
  Goodwill is calculated at excess of cost of 
investment over share of fair value of net 
assets acquired on the date of acquisition 
and is disclosed as an additional information 
in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
  Dividends received or receivable from joint 
ventures are recognised as a reduction in the 
carrying amount of the investment.
  When Embassy Office Parks Group’s share of 
losses in an equity-accounted investment equals 
or exceeds its interest in the entity, including 
any other unsecured long-term receivables, 
Embassy Office Parks Group does not recognize 
further losses, unless it has incurred obligations 
or made payments on behalf of the other entity.
  Unrealised gains on transactions between 
Embassy Office Parks Group and joint ventures 
are eliminated to the extent of Embassy 
Office Parks Group's interest in these entities. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the 
transaction provides evidence of an impairment 
of the asset transferred. Accounting policies 
of equity accounted investees are consistent 
with the policies adopted by the Embassy 
Office Parks Group.
  The carrying amount of equity accounted 
investments are tested for impairment in 
accordance with the Embassy Office Parks 
Group’s policy.
 Basis of Business Combination
 The Embassy Office Parks Group accounts for its 
business combinations under acquisition method of 
accounting. Acquisition related costs are recognised 
in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in 
the period in which the costs are incurred and the 
services are received. The acquiree’s identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet 
the condition for recognition are recognised at their 
fair values at the acquisition date.
 The Embassy Office Parks Group determines 
that it has acquired a business when the acquired 
set of activities and assets include an input and a 
substantive process that together significantly 
contribute to the ability to create outputs. The 
acquired process is considered substantive if it is 
critical to the ability to continue producing outputs, 
and the inputs acquired include an organised 
workforce with the necessary skills, knowledge, or 
experience to perform that process or it significantly 
contributes to the ability to continue producing 
outputs and is considered unique or scarce or cannot 
be replaced without significant cost, effort, or delay 
in the ability to continue producing outputs. When

Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to Accounts
(all amounts in H million unless otherwise stated)
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to Accounts
(all amounts in H million unless otherwise stated)
the Embassy Office Parks Group acquires a business, 
it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed 
for appropriate classification and designation in 
accordance with the contractual terms, economic 
circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the 
acquisition date.
 When the acquisition of subsidiaries represent a 
business combination, purchase consideration paid 
in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired 
is recognised as goodwill. Where the fair value of 
identifiable assets and liabilities exceed the cost of 
acquisition, after reassessing the fair values of the 
net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is 
recognised as capital reserve.
 Requirements of Ind AS 103 apply to a transaction 
in which assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
constitute a business. However, para B7A and B7B 
of Ind AS 103 allow an optional concentration test to 
perform simplified assessment of whether acquired 
set of activities and assets is not a business. The 
consequence of the test is that if the concentration 
test is met, the set of activities and assets is 
determined not to be a business and no further 
assessment is needed.
 When the acquisition of an asset or group of assets 
does not constitute a business, it is accounted for as 
an acquisition of a group of assets and liabilities. The 
cost of the acquisition is allocated to the individual 
identified assets and liabilities acquired based upon 
their relative fair values and no goodwill or deferred 
tax is recognised.
 For any identifiable asset or liability initially measured 
at an amount other than cost, Embassy Office Parks 
Group initially measures that asset or liability at the 
amount specified in the applicable Ind AS. Embassy 
Office Parks Group deduct from the cost of the group 
of assets the amounts allocated to these assets and 
liabilities, and then allocate the residual cost of 
acquisition to the remaining identifiable assets and 
liabilities based on their relative fair values at the 
date of acquisition.
 Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the 
acquirer is recognised at fair value at the acquisition 
date. Contingent consideration is classified either 
as equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified 
as a financial liability are subsequently remeasured 
to fair value with changes in fair value recognised 
in profit or loss, except for changes in fair value 
which are measurement period adjustments, 
wherein the change is adjusted with the asset/
liability recognised at the acquisition date with 
corresponding adjustment to goodwill. Contingent 
consideration that is classified as equity is not re-
measured at subsequent reporting dates subsequent 
its settlement is accounted for within equity.
 The interest of non-controlling shareholders is 
initially measured either at fair value or at the non-
controlling interests’ proportionate share of the 
acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of 
measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-
acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the 
carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the 
amount of those interests at initial recognition plus 
the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent 
changes in equity of subsidiaries.
 Business combinations arising from transfers of 
interests in entities that are under common control 
are accounted at historical cost. The difference 
between any consideration given and the aggregate 
historical carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of 
the acquired entity is recorded in Unitholders’ equity.
2.2 Summary of material accounting policies
 a) Functional and presentation currency
  The Condensed Consolidated Financial 
Statements are presented in Indian Rupees, 
which is the Embassy Office Parks REIT’s 
functional currency and the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the 
Embassy Office Parks Group operates. All 
financial information presented in Indian Rupees 
has been rounded off to nearest million except 
unit and per unit data.
 b) Basis of measurement
  The Condensed Consolidated Financial 
Statements are prepared on the historical cost 
basis, except for the following:
  - Certain financial assets and liabilities (refer 
accounting policy regarding financial 
instrument): measured at fair values;
  - Net defined benefit (asset)/ liability less 
present value of defined obligations: Fair 
value of plan assets less present value of 
defined benefit plan;
  - The assets and liabilities of the SPVs on the 
date of acquisition have been accounted 
using their Fair value and the goodwill / 
capital reserve amount has been calculated 
accordingly; and
  - Contingent consideration: measured at  
fair value;
  - Assets held for sale: measured at lower of 
carrying amount or fair value less costs of 
disposal - note 2.2 (h).
 c) Use of judgments and estimates
  The preparation of Condensed Consolidated 
Financial Statements in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles in 
India (Ind AS) requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses. Actual results could differ from 
those estimates.
  Estimates and underlying assumptions are 
reviewed on a periodic basis. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimates are revised and in 
any future periods affected.
  Information about critical judgements in 
applying accounting policies that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised 
in the Condensed Consolidated Financial 
Statements is included in the following notes:
  i) Business combinations
   The Embassy Office Parks Group acquires 
subsidiaries that own real estate. At the 
time of acquisition, the Group considers 
whether each acquisition represents the 
acquisition of a business or the acquisition 
of an asset. The Group accounts for an 
acquisition as a business combination 
where an integrated set of activities and 
assets, including property, is acquired. 
More specifically, consideration is given to 
the extent to which substantive processes 
are acquired and, in particular, the extent 
of services provided by the subsidiary.
   In accounting for business combinations, 
judgment is required in identifying 
whether an identifiable intangible asset is 
to be recorded separately from goodwill. 
Estimating the acquisition date fair 
value of the identifiable assets acquired, 
useful life thereof and liabilities assumed 
involves management judgment. These 
measurements are based on information 
available at the acquisition date and are 
based on expectations and assumptions 
that have been deemed reasonable by the 
management. Changes in these judgments, 
estimates and assumptions can materially 
affect the results of operations.
  ii) Impairment of goodwill and intangible 
assets with infinite useful life
   For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite 
useful life acquired in a business combination 
is, from the acquisition date, allocated to 
each of the Embassy Office Parks Group’s 
cash-generating units that are expected to 
benefit from the combination. In performing 
such impairment assessments, management 
compared the carrying value of each of the 
identifiable cash generating units (“CGUs”) 
to which goodwill and such intangible assets 
had been allocated with their respective 
‘value in use’ computed based on discounted 
cash flow method, to determine if any 
impairment loss should be recognized. The 
discounted cash flow method involves 
estimating future cash flows, growth rates 
and discount rates which require significant 
management judgement - Note 2.2 (j).
  iii) Classification of lease arrangements 
as finance lease or operating lease 
- Note 2.2 (r).
  iv) Classification of assets as investment 
properties or as property, plant and 
equipment - Notes 2.2 (f) and (g).
  v) Significant judgements involved in the 
purchase price allocation of the assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed on account 
of Business Combination and deferred 
tax accounting on the resultant fair value 
accounting– Note on Basis of Business 
Combination and Note 2.2 (v) (ii).
  vi) Judgements in preparing Condensed 
Consolidated Financial Statements  
- Note 2.1.

the allocation cost of acquisition to the 
identifiable assets and liabilities based 
on their relative fair values at the date of 
acquisition in case of acquisition that does 
not represent a business combination – 
Note on Basis of Business Combination.
  ix) Classification of assets held for sale & 
liabilities directly associated with the 
assets held for sale - Note 2.2 (h).
   Information about assumptions and 
estimation uncertainties that have a 
significant risk resulting in a material 
adjustment during the half year ended 
30 September 2025 is included in the 
following notes:
   i) Fair valuation and disclosures and 
impairment of non-financial assets 
being investment properties and 
property plant and equipment 
- The fair value of investment 
properties and property, plant and 
equipment are reviewed regularly 
by management with reference to 
independent property valuations 
and market conditions existing at 
half yearly basis. The independent 
valuers are independent appraisers 
with a recognised and relevant 
professional qualification and with 
recent experience in the location and 
category of the investment properties 
being valued. Judgment is also 
applied in determining the extent and 
frequency of independent appraisals.
    SEBI Circulars issued under the REIT 
Regulations require disclosures 
relating to net assets at fair value 
and total returns at fair value (Refer 
Statement of net assets at fair value 
and Statement of total returns at fair 
value for details).
    Refer note 2.2 (j) as regards 
estimates and assumptions 
involved in impairment assessment 
of non-financial assets being 
investment properties and property 
plant and equipment.
   ii) Useful lives of Investment Properties 
and Property, Plant and Equipment–
Notes 2.2(f) and (g).
   iii) Valuation of financial 
instruments –Note 2.2 (l).
   iv) Recognition of deferred tax asset on 
carried forward losses and recognition 
of minimum alternate tax credit: 
availability of future taxable profit 
against which tax losses carried 
forward can be used- Note 2.2(v)
(ii). Further, significant judgements 
are involved in determining the 
provision for income taxes, including 
recognition of minimum alternate 
tax credit, in SPVs entitled for tax 
deduction under Section 80IAB of 
the Income Tax Act, 1961, wherein 
the tax deduction is dependent upon 
necessary details available for exempt 
and non-exempt income.
 d) Current versus non-current classification
  The Embassy Office Parks Group presents assets 
and liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated 
Balance Sheet based on current/ non-current 
classification:
  An asset is treated as current when it is:
  - Expected to be realised or intended to be 
sold or consumed in normal operating cycle;
  - Held primarily for the purpose of trading;
  - Expected to be realised within twelve 
months after the reporting period; or
  - Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted 
from being exchanged or used to settle a 
liability for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period.
  All other assets are classified as non-current.
  A liability is current when:
  - It is expected to be settled in normal 
operating cycle;
  - It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
  - It is due to be settled within twelve months 
after the reporting period; or
  - There is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting period.
  The Embassy Office Parks Group classifies all 
other liabilities as non-current.
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified 
as non-current assets and liabilities.
  The operating cycle is the time between the 
acquisition of assets for processing and their 
realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The 
Embassy Office Parks Group has identified 
twelve months as its operating cycle.
  The Trust has net current liabilities of H41,710.40 
million as at 30 September 2025 mainly due to 
the maturity of Commercial Paper - Series D 
in February 2026, Commercial Paper - Series 
E & F in March 2026, ECPL Series I NCD 2023 
in May 2026 and Embassy REIT Series IV NCD 
2021 in September 2026. Based on the Group’s 
liquidity position including undrawn borrowing 
facilities as well as a low leverage of 31% Net 
debt to Gross asset value, the Trust will be able 
to refinance its borrowings and meet its current 
obligations as and when they fall due.
 e) Measurement of fair values
  A number of the Embassy Office Parks Group 
accounting policies and disclosures require the 
measurement of fair values, for both financial 
and non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair value 
is the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants 
at the measurement date. The fair value 
measurement is based on the presumption that 
the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the 
liability takes place either:
  - in the principal market for the asset 
or liability; or
  - in the absence of a principal market, in 
the most advantageous market for the 
asset or liability.
  The principal or the most advantageous market 
must be accessible by the Embassy Office Parks 
Group. The fair value of an asset or a liability 
is measured using the assumptions that market 
participants would use when pricing the asset 
or liability, assuming that market participants 
act in their economic best interest.
  A fair value measurement of a non-financial 
asset takes into account a market participant’s 
ability to generate economic benefits by using 
the asset in its highest and best use or by selling 
it to another market participant that would use 
the asset in its highest and best use.
  The Embassy Office Parks Group uses 
valuation techniques that are appropriate in 
the circumstances and for which sufficient data 
are available to measure fair value, maximising 
the use of relevant observable inputs and 
minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
  The Embassy Office Parks Group has an 
established control framework with respect to 
the measurement of fair values. The Embassy 
Office Parks Group engages with external 
registered valuers for measurement of fair values 
in the absence of quoted prices in active markets.
  While measuring the fair value of an asset or 
liability, the Embassy Office Parks Group uses 
market observable data as far as possible. Fair 
values are categorised into different levels in a 
fair value hierarchy based on inputs used in the 
valuation techniques as follows-
  - Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities.
  - Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices 
included in Level 1 that are observable for 
the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as 
prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
  - Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that 
are not based on observable market data 
(unobservable inputs).
  When measuring the fair value of an asset or a 
liability, the Embassy Office Parks Group uses 
observable market data as far as possible. If 
the inputs used to measure the fair value of 
an asset or a liability fall into different levels 
of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value 
measurement is categorised in its entirety in 
the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the 
lowest level input that is significant to the entire 
measurement. The Embassy Office Parks Group

Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

(all amounts in H million unless otherwise stated)
recognises transfers between levels of the fair 
value hierarchy at the end of the reporting 
period during which the change has occurred.
 f) Investment properties
  Property that is held for long-term rental yields 
or for capital appreciation or both is classified 
as investment properties. Investment properties 
is measured initially at its cost, including 
related transaction costs and where applicable 
borrowing costs. Subsequent expenditure is 
capitalised to the asset’s carrying amount only 
when it is probable that future economic benefits 
associated with the expenditure will flow to 
the Embassy Office Parks Group and the cost 
of the item can be measured reliably. The cost 
of the assets not ready for their intended use 
before such date, are disclosed as investment 
properties under development. All other 
repairs and maintenance costs are expensed 
when incurred. When part of an investment 
properties is replaced, the carrying amount of 
such replaced position is derecognised.
  Investment properties are depreciated on 
straight-line method over their estimated 
useful lives. However, where the management’s 
estimate of the remaining useful life of the 
assets on a review subsequent to the time of 
acquisition is different, then depreciation is 
provided over the remaining useful life based 
on the revised useful life. The residual values, 
useful lives and methods of depreciation 
are reviewed at each financial year end and 
adjusted prospectively.
  Pursuant to this policy, Management’s estimates 
of useful life of the following major assets under 
straight-line method are as follows:
Asset category Estimated useful life 
(in years)
Buildings** 5 - 60 years
Plant and Machinery 10-15 years
Furniture and Fixtures 12 years
Electrical Equipment 15 years
Leasehold land* 30 - 99 years based 
on the lease period
Leasehold building 10 years based on the 
lease period
  Based on technical evaluation, the Group 
believes that the useful lives, as given above, 
best represent the period over which the Group 
expects to use these assets. Hence, the useful 
lives for these assets is different from the useful 
lives as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II 
of the Companies Act 2013.
  Pro-rata depreciation is provided on properties 
purchased or sold during the year.
  *Upfront premium paid under lease-cum-sale agreements 
to acquire land where the Embassy Office Parks Group has 
an option to purchase the land at the end of/ during the 
lease term are not amortised over the lease period. Lease 
period is the non-cancellable period of a lease, together 
with periods covered by an option to extend the lease if 
the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option.
  ** Useful life of building is restricted to the lease term of 
leasehold land on which the building is constructed.
  Investment properties acquired on Business 
Combination is depreciated over the remaining 
useful life from the date of acquisition as 
certified by the technical valuer.
  Investment properties are subsequently 
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses, if any.
  Investment properties are derecognised either 
when they have been disposed of or when 
they are permanently withdrawn from use and 
no future economic benefit is expected from 
their disposal. The difference between the net 
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of 
the asset is recognised in profit or loss in the 
period of derecognition. In determining the 
amount of consideration from the derecognition 
of Investment properties the Group considers 
the effects of variable consideration, existence 
of a significant financing component, non-cash 
consideration, and consideration payable to the 
buyer (if any).
  Note: Plant and machinery, furniture and fixtures, 
office equipment and electrical equipment 
which are physically attached to the building are 
considered as part of the investment properties.
 g) Property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets
  Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost 
of acquisition or construction less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment. The cost of 
property, plant and equipment includes freight, 
duties, taxes and other incidental expenses 
related to the acquisition or construction of the 
respective assets. The cost of such assets not 
ready for their intended use are disclosed as 
capital work-in-progress.
  Intangible assets are recorded at their 
acquisition cost. The cost of intangible assets 
acquired in a business combination is their 
fair value at the date of acquisition. Following 
initial recognition, intangible assets are carried 
at cost less any accumulated amortisation and 
accumulated impairment losses.
  Depreciation is provided on the straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful lives of each 
component of an item of property, plant and 
equipment and intangibles as follows:
Asset category Estimated useful life 
(in years)
Buildings 60 years
Plant and Machinery 15 years
Furniture and Fixtures 12 years
Electrical Equipment 15 years
Office Equipment 5 years
Computers 3 years
Computer Software 3 years
Operating Supplies 2-5 years
Vehicles 8 years
  Based on technical evaluation, the Group 
believes that the useful lives, as given above, 
best represent the period over which the Group 
expects to use these assets. Hence, the useful 
lives for these assets is different from the useful 
lives as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II 
of the Companies Act 2013.
  Upfront premium paid under lease-cum-sale 
agreements to acquire land where the Embassy 
Office Parks Group has an option to purchase 
the land at the end of/ during the lease term are 
not amortised over the lease period.
  The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed 
as either finite or indefinite.
  Right to use trademark: The earnings potential 
of trade name/ trademark can at times be 
substantial. A trademark is recognized on 
a reporting company’s balance sheet as an 
intangible asset separate from goodwill because 
it satisfies either of the following two tests:
  - It arises from legal rights (a trademark is 
essentially a bundle of rights)
  - It is capable of being sold, transferred, and 
licensed separately from other assets of 
the acquiring company
  The recognition of an acquired trademark 
is performed as part of a purchase price 
allocation, whereby a portion of the price paid 
by the acquirer for all of the acquired assets is 
assigned to the trademark using an acceptable 
valuation methodology.
  The life of the Right to use trademark is 
considered indefinite because there is no 
foreseeable limit nor any specific covenant 
that limits the time period over which the 
asset is expected to generate net cash 
inflows for the SPVs.
  Intangible assets comprising of Right to use 
trademark with indefinite useful lives are not 
amortised, but are tested for impairment 
annually, at the cash-generating unit level. 
The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed 
annually to determine whether the indefinite life 
continues to be supportable. If not, the change 
in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on 
a prospective basis.
  Power purchase agreement is one of the 
essential contracts required for a small power 
generating company with limited production 
capacity and marketability. Since sales with the 
customer take the form of a contract, the power 
purchase agreement meets the contractual 
criteria for recognition. This agreement provides 
ongoing and repeat business for the company 
and provides a platform for the company to 
reach profitability.
  The initial useful life of the power purchase 
agreements is estimated to be 25 years based 
on the contract period and hence are amortised 
over the useful economic life and assessed for 
impairment whenever there is an indication 
that the intangible asset may be impaired.

method for an intangible asset with a finite

useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each 
reporting period and adjusted prospectively.
  Common Area Maintenance (CAM) service 
rights are contract-based intangible assets, 
which represent the value of contractual rights 
that arise from contractual arrangements. An 
entity establishes relationships with its customers 
through certain contracts, these customer 
relationships arise from contractual rights. 
CAM service rights are recognised at their 
fair value as at the date of acquisition, these 
are subsequently amortised on a straight-line 
basis, over their estimated contractual lives 
which is 5 years.
  Property, plant and equipment and Intangibles 
acquired on Business Combination, except 
right-to-use trademark, is depreciated over the 
remaining useful life from the date of acquisition 
as certified by the technical valuer.
  When parts of an item of plant and equipment 
have different useful lives, they are treated as 
separate components and depreciated over 
their respective estimated useful lives.
  The residual values, useful lives and methods of 
depreciation are reviewed at each financial year 
end and adjusted prospectively.
  Pro-rata depreciation is provided on all 
property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets purchased or sold during the year.
  Property, plant and equipment are subsequently 
measured at cost net of accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment 
losses, if any.
  An item of property, plant and equipment 
and any significant part initially recognised 
is derecognised upon disposal or when no 
future economic benefits are expected from 
its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on 
derecognition of the asset (calculated as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset) is 
included in the consolidated statement of profit 
and loss when the asset is derecognised.
  An intangible asset shall be derecognised upon 
disposal or when no future economic benefits 
are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain 
or loss arising on derecognition of an intangible 
asset (calculated as the difference between the 
net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount 
of the asset) is included in the consolidated 
statement of profit or loss when the asset 
is derecognised.
 h) Non-current assets held for sale
  Non-current assets are classified as held 
for sale if it is highly probable that they will 
be recovered primarily through sale rather 
than through continuing use. Such assets 
are generally measured at the lower of their 
carrying amount and fair value less costs of 
disposal. Losses on initial classification as 
held for sale and subsequent gains and losses 
on re-measurement are recognised in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss.
  Once classified as held-for-sale, intangible 
assets, property, plant and equipment and 
investment properties are no longer amortised 
or depreciated.
  Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale 
are presented separately from other items in 
the Condensed Consolidated Balance sheet.
 i) Inventory
  Stores and operating supplies
  Inventories which comprises food and 
beverages and operating supplies are valued 
at lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost of 
inventories comprises purchase price, costs of 
conversion and other incidental costs incurred 
in bringing the inventories to their present 
location and condition. In determining the cost, 
weighted average cost method is used.
  Net realisable value is the estimated selling 
price in the ordinary course of business less 
estimated costs to sell.
 j) Impairment of non-financial assets
  The Embassy Office Parks Group assesses, 
at each reporting date, whether there is an 
indication that a non-financial asset other than 
inventories and deferred tax assets may be 
impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual 
impairment testing for an asset is required, the 
Embassy Office Parks Group estimates the 
asset’s recoverable amount.
  An impairment loss is recognised in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss if 
the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-
generating unit (CGU) exceeds its recoverable 
unit. Impairment loss recognised in respect of 
a CGU is allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, 
and then to reduce the carrying amounts of 
the other assets of the CGU on a pro-rata 
basis. A CGU is the smallest identifiable asset 
group that generates cash flows that are 
largely independent from other assets and 
groups. Impairment losses are recognised in 
the consolidated statement of profit and loss, 
unless it reverses previous revaluation credited 
to equity, in which case it is charged to equity.
  Goodwill arising from a business combination is 
allocated to CGUs or group of CGUs that are 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the 
combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment 
on an annual basis and more often, if there is 
an indication that goodwill may be impaired, 
relying on a number of factors including 
operating results, business plans and future 
cash flows. Impairment is determined for 
goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount 
of each CGU (or group of CGUs) to which the 
goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount 
of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an 
impairment loss is recognised.
  An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s or CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal 
and its value in use. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash flows are discounted 
to their present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to 
the asset. In determining fair value less costs of 
disposal, recent market transactions are taken 
into account. For the purpose of impairment 
testing, assets that cannot be tested individually 
are grouped together into the smallest group 
of assets that generates cash inflows from 
continuing use that are largely independent of 
the cash inflows of other assets or CGU.
  Impairment losses recognised in prior periods 
are assessed at each reporting date for any 
indications that the loss has decreased or no 
longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed 
if there has been a change in the estimates 
used to determine the recoverable amount. 
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is 
not subsequently reversed. In respect of other 
assets, such a reversal is made only to the 
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined, net of depreciation, if 
no impairment loss had been recognised.
 k) Foreign currency transactions
  Transactions in foreign currencies are translated 
into the respective functional currencies of 
Embassy Office Parks Group’s entities at the 
exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.
  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are translated into the 
functional currency at the exchange rate at 
the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities that are measured at fair value in a 
foreign currency are translated into the functional 
currency at the exchange rate when the fair 
value was determined. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities that are measured based on historical 
cost in a foreign currency are translated at the 
exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
  Exchange differences arising on foreign 
exchange transactions settled and from 
translations during the year are recognised in 
the consolidated statement of profit and loss 
of the year except exchange differences arising 
from the translation of the items which are 
recognised in OCI.
 l) Financial instruments
  i) Recognition and initial measurement
   Trade receivables and debt securities 
issued are initially recognised when 
they are originated. All other financial 
assets and financial liabilities are initially 
recognised when the Embassy Office Parks 
Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
   A financial asset or financial liability is 
initially measured at fair value (except 
for trade receivables which are initially 
measured at transaction price) plus, for an 
item not at fair value through profit or loss 
(FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to its acquisition or issue.

  ii) Classification and subsequent 
measurement
   Financial assets
   On initial recognition, a financial asset is 
classified as measured at
   - Amortised cost;
   - Fair value through other comprehensive 
income (FVOCI) – debt instrument;
   - Fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVOCI) – 
equity instrument; or
   - Fair value through profit 
or loss (FVTPL)
   Financial assets are not reclassified 
subsequent to their initial recognition, 
except if and in the period the Embassy 
Office Parks Group changes its business 
model for managing financial assets.
   A financial asset is measured at amortised 
cost if it meets both of the following 
conditions and is not designated as FVTPL:
   - the asset is held within a business 
model whose objective is to hold assets 
to collect contractual cash flows; and
   - the contractual terms of the financial 
asset give rise on specified dates to 
cash flows that are solely payments 
of the principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
   A debt investment is measured at FVOCI 
if it meets both of the following conditions 
and is not designated as FVTPL:
   - the asset is held within a business 
model whose objective is achieved by 
both collecting contractual cash flows 
and selling financial assets; and
   - the contractual terms of the financial 
asset give rise on specified dates to 
cash flows that are solely payments 
of the principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.
   On initial recognition of an equity 
instrument that is not held for trading, 
the Embassy Office Parks Group may 
irrevocably elect to present subsequent 
changes in the investment’s fair value 
in OCI (designated as FVOCI – equity 
investment). This election is made on an 
investment by investment basis.
   All financial assets not classified as measured 
at amortised cost or FVOCI as described 
above are measured at FVTPL. This includes 
all derivative financial assets. On initial 
recognition, the Embassy Office Parks Group 
may irrevocably designate a financial asset 
that otherwise meets the requirements to be 
measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI or at 
FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly 
reduces an accounting mismatch that would 
otherwise arise.
   Financial assets: Business model 
assessment
   The Embassy Office Parks Group makes an 
assessment of the objective of the business 
model in which a financial asset is held at 
a portfolio level because this best reflects 
the way the business is managed and 
information is provided to the Management. 
The information considered includes:
   - the stated policies and objectives 
for the portfolio and the operation of 
those policies in practice. These include 
whether management’s strategy 
focuses on earning contractual interest 
income, maintaining a particular interest 
rate profile, matching the duration of 
the financial assets to the duration 
of any related liabilities or expected 
cash outflows or realising cash flows 
through the sale of the assets;
   - how the performance of the portfolio is 
evaluated and reported to the Embassy 
Office Parks Group’s management;
   - the risks that affect the performance 
of the business model (and the 
financial assets held within that 
business model) and how those 
risks are managed;
   - how managers of the business 
are compensated – e.g. whether 
compensation is based on the fair 
value of the assets managed or the 
contractual cash flows collected; and
   - the frequency, volume and timing 
of sales of financial assets in prior 
periods, the reasons for such sales 
and expectations about future 
sales activity.
   Transfers of financial assets to third parties 
in transactions that do not qualify for 
derecognition are not considered sales 
for this purpose, consistent with the 
Embassy Office Parks Group’s continuing 
recognition of the assets.
   Financial assets that are held for trading 
or are managed and whose performance 
is evaluated on a fair value basis are 
measured at FVTPL.
   Financial assets: Assessment whether 
contractual cash flows are solely payments 
of principal and interest
   For the purpose of this assessment, 
‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of 
the financial asset on initial recognition. 
‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for 
the time value of money and for the credit 
risk associated with the principal amount 
outstanding during a particular period of 
time and for other basic lending risks and 
costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative 
costs), as well as a profit margin.
   In assessing whether the contractual cash 
flows are solely payments of principal 
and interest, the Embassy Office Parks 
Group considers the contractual terms of 
the instrument. This includes assessing 
whether the financial asset contains a 
contractual term that could change the 
timing or amount of contractual cash flows 
such that it would not meet this condition. 
In making this assessment, the Embassy 
Office Parks Group considers:
   - contingent events that would change 
the amount or timing of cash flows;
   - terms that may adjust the contractual 
coupon rate, including variable 
interest rate features;
   - prepayment and extension features; and
   - terms that limit the Embassy Office 
Parks Group’s claim to cash flows 
from specified assets (e.g. non – 
recourse features)
   A prepayment feature is consistent with 
the solely payment of principal and 
interest criterion if the prepayment amount 
substantially represents unpaid amounts 
of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding, which may include 
reasonable additional compensation 
for early termination of the contract. 
Additionally, for a financial asset acquired 
at a significant discount or premium to 
its contractual par amount, a feature 
that permits or requires prepayment at 
an amount that substantially represents 
the contractual par amount plus accrued 
(but unpaid) contractual interest (which 
may also include reasonable additional 
compensation for early termination) is 
treated as consistent with this criterion if 
the fair value of the prepayment feature is 
insignificant at initial recognition.
   Financial assets: Subsequent measurement and gains and losses
Financial assets at 
FVTPL
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, 
including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit and loss.
Financial assets at 
amortised cost
These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest 
income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in 
profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit and loss.

Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to Accounts
(all amounts in H million unless otherwise stated)
Debt instruments 
at FVOCI
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income under the 
effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are 
recognised in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On 
derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit and loss. 
Equity instruments 
at FVOCI
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as 
income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of 
the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and 
are not reclassified to profit and loss.
   Financial liabilities: Classification, 
subsequent measurement and gains and 
losses
   Financial liabilities are classified as measured 
at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial 
liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified 
as held for trading, or it is a derivative or it 
is designated as such on initial recognition. 
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at 
fair value and net gains and losses, including 
any interest expense, are recognised in 
profit or loss. Other financial liabilities are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method. Interest 
expense and foreign exchange gains and 
losses are recognised in profit and loss. 
Any gain or loss on derecognition is also 
recognised in profit and loss.
  iii) Derecognition
   Financial assets
   The Embassy Office Parks Group 
derecognises a financial asset when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from 
the financial asset expire, or it transfers the 
rights to receive the contractual cash flows 
in a transaction in which substantially all of 
the risks and rewards of ownership of the 
financial asset are transferred or in which 
the Embassy Office Parks Group neither 
transfers nor retains substantially all of the 
risks and rewards of ownership and does 
not retain control of the financial asset.
   If the Embassy Office Parks Group enters 
into transactions whereby it transfers 
assets recognised in its Condensed 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, but retains 
either all or substantially all of the risks 
and rewards of the transferred assets, the 
transferred assets are not derecognised.
   Financial liabilities
   The Embassy Office Parks Group 
derecognises a financial liability when its 
contractual obligations are discharged or 
cancelled, or expired.
   The Embassy Office Parks Group also 
derecognises a financial liability when its 
terms are modified and the cash flows 
under the modified terms are substantially 
different. In this case, a new financial 
liability based on the modified terms is 
recognised at fair value. The difference 
between the carrying amount of the 
financial liability extinguished and the new 
financial liability with modified terms is 
recognised in profit and loss.
  iv) Offsetting
   Financial assets and financial liabilities are 
offset and the net amount presented in the 
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet 
only when the Embassy Office Parks Group 
has a legally enforceable right to set off 
the amounts and it intends either to settle 
them on a net basis or to realise the asset 
and settle the liability simultaneously.
 m) Compound financial instruments
  An instrument may contain both a financial liability 
and equity component. The liability component 
of a compound financial instrument is initially 
recognised at the fair value of a similar liability 
that does not have an equity conversion option. 
The equity component is initially recognised 
at the difference between the fair value of the 
compound financial instrument as a whole 
and the fair value of the liability component. 
Any directly attributable transaction costs are 
allocated to the liability and equity components 
in proportion to their initial carrying amounts.
  Subsequent to initial recognition, the 
liability component of a compound financial 
instrument is measured at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method. The equity 
component of a compound financial instrument 
is not measured subsequently.
  Interest related to the financial liability 
is recognised in profit and loss (unless it 
qualifies for inclusion in cost of asset). In 
case of conversion at maturity, the financial 
liability is reclassified to equity and no gain or 
loss is recognised.
 n) Rental support
  Rental supports that are an integral part of an 
acquisition transaction is treated as a deduction 
in the acquisition cost of such investment 
properties. Where, the right to receive the rental 
support is spread over a period of time, the 
right to receive the rental support is reduced 
from the acquisition cost and is recognised as 
a financial asset at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost based on effective 
interest rate method.
 o) Impairment of financial assets
  Financial assets
  The Embassy Office Parks Group recognises 
loss allowances for expected credit losses on:
  - financial assets measured at 
amortised cost; and
  - financial assets measured at FVOCI- 
debt investments
  At each reporting date, the Embassy Office Parks 
Group assesses whether financial assets carried 
at amortised cost and debt securities at FVOCI 
are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-
impaired’ when one or more events that have 
a detrimental impact on the estimated future 
cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.
  Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired 
includes the following observable data:
  - significant financial difficulty of the 
borrower or issuer; or
  - a breach of contract such as a default or 
being past due for 180 days or more; or
  - the restructuring of a loan or advance by 
the Embassy Office Parks Group on terms 
that in the material assessment of the 
Embassy Office Parks Group it would not 
consider otherwise; or
  - it is probable that the borrower will 
enter bankruptcy or other financial 
reorganization; or
  - the disappearance of an active market for a 
security because of financial difficulties
  The Embassy Office Parks Group measures 
loss allowances at an amount equal to 
lifetime expected credit losses, except for the 
following, which are measured as 12 month 
expected credit losses:
  - debt securities that are determined to have 
low credit risk at the reporting date; and
  - other debt securities and bank balances 
for which credit risk (i.e. the risk of default 
occurring over the expected life of the 
financial instrument) has not increased 
significantly since initial recognition.
  Loss allowances for trade receivables are 
always measured at an amount equal to lifetime 
expected credit losses.
  Lifetime expected credit losses are the 
expected credit losses that result from all 
possible default events over the expected life of 
a financial instrument.
  12-month expected credit losses are the 
portion of expected credit losses that result 
from default events that are possible within 12 
months after the reporting date (or a shorter 
period if the expected life of the instrument is 
less than 12 months).
  In all cases, the maximum period considered 
when estimating expected credit losses is 
the maximum contractual period over which 
the Embassy Office Parks Group is exposed 
to credit risk.
  When determining whether the credit risk of 
a financial asset has increased significantly 
since initial recognition and when estimating 
expected credit losses, the Embassy Office 
Parks Group considers reasonable and

Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

(all amounts in H million unless otherwise stated)
supportable information that is relevant and 
available without undue cost or effort. This 
includes both quantitative and qualitative 
information and analysis, based on the Embassy 
Office Parks Group’s historical experience and 
informed credit assessment and including 
forward-looking information.
  The Embassy Office Parks Group assumes that 
the credit risk on a financial asset has increased 
significantly if it is more than 180 days past due.
  The Embassy Office Parks Group considers a 
financial asset to be default when:
  - the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit 
obligations to the Embassy Office Parks 
Group in full, without recourse by the 
Embassy Office Parks Group to actions 
such as realising security (if any is held); or
  - the financial asset is 180 days or more past 
due without any security
  Measurement of expected credit losses: 
Expected credit losses are a probability-
weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses 
are measured as the present value of all cash 
shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash 
flows due to the Embassy Office Parks Group 
and the cash flows that the Embassy Office 
Parks Group expects to receive).
  Presentation of allowance for expected credit 
losses in the balance sheet:  Loss allowances 
for financial assets measured at amortised cost 
are deducted from the gross carrying amount 
of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the 
loss allowance is charged to profit and loss 
account and is recognised in OCI.
  Write-off: The gross carrying amount of a 
financial asset is written off (either partially or 
in full) to the extent that there is no realistic 
prospect of recovery. This is generally the 
case when the Embassy Office Parks Group 
determines that the debtor does not have 
assets or sources of income that could generate 
sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts 
subject to write-off. However, financial assets 
that are written off could still be subject to 
enforcement activities in order to comply with 
the Embassy Office Parks Group’s procedures 
for recovery of amounts due.
  Majority of the financial assets of the Embassy 
Office Parks Group pertain to trade and other 
receivables. Considering the nature of business, 
the Embassy Office Parks Group does not 
foresee any credit risk on its trade and other 
receivables which may cause an impairment. 
As per the agreement with tenants, the 
receivables are covered by clause of payment 
security mechanism which ensures receipt 
of all trade receivables. Also, the Embassy 
Office Parks Group does not have any past 
history of significant impairment of trade and 
other receivables.
 p) Embedded derivatives
  When the Embassy Office Parks Group 
becomes a party to a hybrid contract with a 
host that is not an asset within the scope of 
Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments, it identifies 
whether there is an embedded derivative. 
Embedded derivatives are separated from the 
host contract and accounted for separately if 
the host contract is not a financial asset and 
certain criteria are met.
 q) Financial guarantee contracts
  Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as 
a financial liability at the time the guarantee is 
issued. The liability is initially measured at fair 
value and subsequently at the higher of the 
amount of loss allowance determined as per 
impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the 
amount recognised less, when appropriate, the 
cumulative amount of income recognised in 
accordance with the principles of Ind AS 115.
  The fair value of financial guarantees is 
determined as the present value of the difference 
in net cash flows between the contractual 
payments under the debt instrument and the 
payments that would be required without 
the guarantee, or the estimated amount that 
would be payable to a third party for assuming 
the obligations.
 r) Leases
  Embassy Office Parks Group as a lessee
  A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract 
conveys the right to control the use of an 
identified asset for a period of time in exchange 
for consideration.
  The Embassy Office Parks Group recognises 
right-of-use asset representing its right to 
use the underlying asset for the lease term at 
the lease commencement date. The cost of 
the right-of-use asset measured at inception 
shall comprise of the amount of the initial 
measurement of the lease liability, adjusted 
for any lease payments made at or before the 
commencement date, less any lease incentives 
received, plus any initial direct costs incurred 
and an estimate of the costs to be incurred 
by the lessee in dismantling and removing the 
underlying asset or restoring the underlying 
asset or site on which it is located.
  The right-of-use assets is subsequently 
measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, 
if any and adjusted for any remeasurement 
of the lease liability. The right-of-use assets 
is depreciated using the straight-line method 
from the commencement date over the shorter 
of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. 
Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment 
whenever there is any indication that their 
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. 
Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss.
  The lease liability is initially measured at the 
present value of the lease payments that are not 
paid at the commencement date, discounted 
using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, 
if that rate cannot be readily determined, the 
incremental borrowing rate applicable to the 
entity within the Embassy Office Parks Group. 
Generally, the Embassy Office Parks Group 
uses its incremental borrowing rate as the 
discount rate. For leases with reasonably similar 
characteristics, the Embassy Office Parks 
Group, on a lease by lease basis, may adopt 
either the incremental borrowing rate specific 
to the lease or the incremental borrowing rate 
for the portfolio as a whole.
  The Embassy Office Parks Group recognises 
the amount of the re-measurement of lease 
liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use 
asset. Where the carrying amount of the right-
of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a 
further reduction in the measurement of the 
lease liability, the Embassy Office Parks Group 
recognises any remaining amount of the re-
measurement in profit and loss.
  The Embassy Office Parks Group has elected 
not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease 
liabilities for short-term leases of all assets 
that have a lease term of 12 months or less and 
leases of low-value assets. The Embassy Office 
Parks Group recognizes the lease payments 
associated with these leases as an expense on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.
  Embassy Office Parks Group as a lessor
  i. Determining whether an arrangement 
contains a lease
   At inception of an arrangement, it is 
determined whether the arrangement 
is or contains a lease. At inception or 
on reassessment of the arrangement 
that contains a lease, the payments and 
other consideration required by such an 
arrangement are separated into those 
for other elements on the basis of their 
relative fair values.
  ii. Assets held under leases
   Leases in which the Embassy Office Parks 
Group does not transfer substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership of an 
asset are classified as operating leases. 
Rental income arising is accounted for on a 
straight-line basis over the non-cancellable 
period of lease term. Leases are classified 
as finance leases when substantially all 
of the risks and rewards of ownership 
transfer from the Embassy Office Parks 
Group to the lessee. Amounts due from 
lessees under finance leases are recorded 
as receivables at the Embassy Office Parks 
Group’s net investment in the leases.
  iii. Initial direct costs
   Initial direct costs such as brokerage 
expenses incurred specifically to earn 
revenues from an operating lease are 
capitalised to the carrying amount of 
leased asset and recognised over the non-
cancellable period of lease term on the 
same basis as rental income.
 s) Revenue recognition
  i) Rental income from investment properties
   Rental income from property leased 
under operating lease is recognised in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss on 
319318

Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to Accounts
(all amounts in H million unless otherwise stated)

(all amounts in H million unless otherwise stated)
a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable 
period of the lease term, including rental 
income to the extent of the economic 
right of the Group pursuant to the co-
development agreement. Lease incentives 
granted are recognised as an integral part 
of the total rental income. Contingent rents 
are recognised as revenue in the period in 
which they are earned on a receipt basis.
  ii) Income from finance lease
   For assets let out under finance lease, 
the Group recognises a receivable at an 
amount equal to the net investment in the 
lease. Rentals received are accounted for as 
repayment of principal and finance income. 
Minimum lease payments receivable on 
finance leases are apportioned between 
the finance income and the reduction of 
the outstanding receivable. The finance 
income allocated to each period during 
the lease term so as to produce a constant 
periodic rate of interest on the remaining 
net investment in the finance lease. 
Contingent rents are recorded as income 
in the periods in which they are earned.
  iii) Revenue from contract with customers
   Revenue towards satisfaction of a 
performance obligation is measured at 
the amount of transaction price (net of 
variable consideration) allocated to that 
performance obligation. The transaction 
price of goods sold and services rendered 
is net of variable consideration on account 
of various discounts and schemes offered 
by the Company as part of the contract.
   Revenue from contracts with customers is 
recognised when control of the goods or 
services are transferred to the customer at 
an amount that reflects the consideration 
to which the Group expects to be entitled 
in exchange for those goods or services.
   Revenue is recognised when recovery of the 
consideration is probable and the amount 
of revenue can be measured reliably.
   a) Revenue from maintenance services is 
recognised as and when the services 
are rendered based on the terms of 
the contracts with the lessees.
   b) Revenue from Food, 
beverages and banquets
    Revenue from food and beverages are 
recorded as and when food is served. 
Revenue generated from the banquet 
services offered are charged on the 
basis of cover charges per person 
which is billed (exclusive of applicable 
taxes) based on guaranteed covers if 
actual cover is less than contracted.
   c) Revenue from Room Rentals
    Revenue from room rentals are based 
on the occupancy charged on the basis 
of room rates which are contracted 
(exclusive of applicable taxes).
   d) Sale of solar energy
    Revenue from sale of power is 
recognized net of cash discount 
over time for each unit of 
electricity generated. 
   e) Other operating income
    Other operating income, including 
service charges on rooms and Food 
& Beverage (F&B) revenues and other 
hospitality-related operating income 
is recognised when the services are 
rendered and the same become 
chargeable. Revenue from other 
services is recognised on accrual basis 
as per the terms of the agreement.
  iv) Recognition of dividend and interest 
income
   Dividend income is recognised in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss 
on the date on which the Embassy Office 
Parks Group’s right to receive payment 
is established.
   Interest income is recognised using the 
effective interest method. The ‘effective 
interest rate’ is the rate that exactly 
discounts estimated future cash receipts 
through the expected life of the financial 
instrument to the gross carrying amount of 
the financial asset.
   In calculating interest income, the effective 
interest rate is applied to the gross carrying 
amount of the asset (when the asset is not 
credit-impaired). However, for financial 
assets that have become credit-impaired 
subsequent to initial recognition, interest 
income is calculated by applying the 
effective interest rate to the amortised 
cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no 
longer credit-impaired, then the calculation 
of interest income reverts to the gross basis.
 t) Employee benefits
  Defined contribution plan
  A defined contribution plan is a post-employment 
benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed 
contributions into a separate entity and will have 
no legal or constructive obligation to pay further 
amounts. The Embassy Office Parks Group 
makes specified monthly contributions towards 
government administered provident fund 
scheme. Obligations for contributions to defined 
contribution plans are recognised as an employee 
benefit expense in profit and loss in the periods 
during which the related services are rendered by 
employees. Prepaid contributions are recognised 
as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a 
reduction in future payments is available.
  Gratuity
  A defined benefit plan is a post-employment 
benefit plan other than a defined contribution 
plan. The Embassy Office Parks Group’s net 
obligation in respect of defined benefit plans 
is calculated separately for each plan by 
estimating the amount of future benefit that 
employees have earned in the current and 
prior periods, discounting that amount and 
deducting the fair value of any plan assets.
  The calculation of defined benefit obligation is 
performed annually by a qualified actuary using 
the projected unit credit method. When the 
calculation results in a potential asset for the 
Embassy Office Parks Group, the recognised 
asset is limited to the present value of economic 
benefits available in the form of any future 
refunds from the plan or reductions in future 
contributions to the plan (‘the asset ceiling’). In 
order to calculate the present value of economic 
benefits, consideration is given to any minimum 
funding requirements.
  Remeasurements of the net defined benefit 
liability, which comprise actuarial gains and 
losses, the return on plan assets (excluding 
interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if 
any, excluding interest), are recognised in OCI. 
The Embassy Office Parks Group determines 
the net interest expense (income) on the net 
defined benefit liability (asset) for the period 
by applying the discount rate used to measure 
the defined benefit obligation at the beginning 
of the annual period to the then-net defined 
benefit liability (asset), taking into account any 
changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) 
during the period as a result of contributions 
and benefit payments. Net interest expense and 
other expenses related to defined benefit plans 
are recognised in profit or loss.
  When the benefits of a plan are changed or 
when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in 
benefit that relates to past service (‘past service 
cost’ or ‘past service gain’) or the gain or loss 
on curtailment is recognised immediately 
in profit or loss. The Embassy Office Parks 
Group recognises gains and losses on the 
settlement of a defined benefit plan when the 
settlement occurs.
  Compensated absences
  Short-term employee benefit obligations are 
measured on an undiscounted basis and are 
expensed as the related service is provided. A 
liability is recognised for the amount expected 
to be paid, if the Embassy Office Parks Group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation 
to pay this amount as a result of past service 
provided by the employee, and the amount of 
obligation can be estimated reliably.
  Assets or liabilities related to employee 
benefit arrangements acquired on Business 
Combination are recognised and measured in 
accordance with Ind AS 19 Employee Benefits.
 u) Borrowing costs
  Borrowing costs are interest and other costs 
(including exchange differences relating to 
foreign currency borrowings to the extent that 
they are regarded as an adjustment to interest 
costs) incurred in connection with the borrowing 
of funds. Borrowing costs directly attributable 
to acquisition or construction of a qualifying 
asset form part of the cost of that asset. Other 
321320
SECTION 05 Half-Yearly Report FY2025-26FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to Accounts
(all amounts in H million unless otherwise stated)
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to Accounts
(all amounts in H million unless otherwise stated)
borrowing costs are recognised as an expense 
in the period in which they are incurred.
  Interest expense is recognised using the 
effective interest method. The ‘effective interest 
rate’ is the rate that exactly discounts estimated 
future cash payments through the expected life 
of the financial instrument to the amortised cost 
of the financial liability. In calculating interest 
expense, the effective interest rate is applied to 
the amortised cost of the liability.
  Capitalisation rate used to determine the 
amount of borrowing costs to be capitalised is 
the weighted average borrowing costs (WABC). 
Capitalisation of borrowing costs is suspended 
during the extended period in which active 
development is interrupted. Capitalisation of 
borrowing costs is ceased when substantially all 
the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying 
asset for its intended use or sale are complete.
 v) Taxation
  Income tax comprises current and deferred 
tax. Income tax expense is recognised in 
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss except to the extent it relates to items 
directly recognised in equity or in other 
comprehensive income.
  (i) Current tax:
   Current tax comprises the expected tax 
payable or receivable on the taxable 
income or loss for the period/year and 
any adjustment to the tax payable or 
receivable in respect of previous years. 
The amount of current tax reflects the best 
estimate of the tax amount expected to 
be paid or received after considering the 
uncertainty, if any, related to income taxes. 
It is measured using tax rates (and tax 
laws) enacted or substantively enacted by 
the reporting date.
   Current tax assets and liabilities are offset 
only if there is a legally enforceable right 
to set off the recognised amounts, and it is 
intended to realise the asset and settle the 
liability on a net basis or simultaneously.
  (ii) Deferred tax:
   Deferred tax is recognised in respect of 
temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the corresponding 
amounts used for taxation purposes. 
Deferred tax is also recognised in respect of 
carried forward tax losses and tax credits. 
Deferred tax is not recognised for:
   - Temporary differences arising on 
the initial recognition of assets and 
liabilities in a transaction that is not a 
business combination and that affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit 
or loss at the time of the transaction;
   - Temporary differences related to 
investments in subsidiaries, associates, 
and joint arrangements to the extent 
that the Embassy Office Parks Group 
is able to control the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary differences 
and it is probable that they will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future; and
   - Taxable temporary differences arising 
on initial recognition of goodwill.
   Deferred income tax asset are recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against 
which they can be used. The existence 
of unused tax losses is strong evidence 
that future taxable profit may not be 
available. Therefore, in case of a history of 
recent losses, the Embassy Office Parks 
Group recognises a deferred tax asset 
only to the extent that it has sufficient 
taxable temporary differences or there is 
convincing other evidence that sufficient 
taxable profit will be available against which 
such deferred tax asset can be realised.
   Deferred tax assets – unrecognised or 
recognised, are reviewed at each reporting 
date and are recognised/reduced to 
the extent that it is probable/no longer 
probable respectively that the related tax 
benefit will be realised.
   Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates 
that are expected to apply to the period 
when the asset is realised or the liability is 
settled, based on the laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date.
   The measurement of deferred tax reflects 
the tax consequences that would follow 
from the manner in which the Embassy 
Office Parks Group expects, at the 
reporting date, to recover or settle the 
carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
   Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset 
if there is a legally enforceable right to 
offset current tax assets and liabilities, and 
they relate to income taxes levied by the 
same tax authority on the same taxable 
entity, or on different tax entities, but they 
intend to settle current tax liabilities and 
assets on a net basis or their tax assets and 
liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
   Tax impact of timing difference which 
arise during the tax holiday period are 
recognised only to the extent of those 
differences which are reversed after the tax 
holiday period.
   Minimum Alternative Tax (‘MAT’) under 
the provisions of the Income Tax, 1961 
is recognised as current tax in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss. The credit available under the Act in 
respect of MAT paid is recognised as an 
asset only when and to the extent there 
is convincing evidence that the Embassy 
Office Parks Group will pay normal income 
tax during the period for which MAT credit 
can be carried forward for set-off against 
normal tax liability. MAT credit recognised 
as an asset is reviewed at each balance 
sheet date and written down to the 
extent the aforesaid convincing evidence 
no longer exists.
   Deferred tax assets or liabilities acquired 
on Business Combination are recognised 
and measured in accordance with Ind AS 
12 Income taxes.
 w) Provisions and contingencies
  The Embassy Office Parks Group recognises 
a provision when there is a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past 
obligating event that probably requires an 
outflow of resources and a reliable estimate 
can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
A disclosure for a contingent liability is made 
when there is a possible obligation or a present 
obligation that may, but probably will not, 
require an outflow of resources. Where there 
is a possible obligation or a present obligation 
that the likelihood of outflow of resources is 
remote, no provision or disclosure is made.
  Provisions for onerous contracts, i.e. contracts 
where the expected unavoidable costs of 
meeting the obligations under the contract 
exceed the economic benefits expected to 
be received under it, are recognised when 
it is probable that an outflow of resources 
embodying economic benefits will be required 
to settle a present obligation as a result of 
an obligating event, based on a reliable estimate 
of such obligation.
  If the effect of the time value of money is 
material, provisions are discounted.
 x) Operating segments
  An operating segment is a component of the 
Embassy Office Parks Group that engages 
in business activities from which it may earn 
revenues and incur expenses. All operating 
segments’ operating results are reviewed 
regularly by a representative of the Embassy 
Office Parks Group, the Embassy Office Parks 
Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker 
(‘CODM’), to make decisions about resources 
to be allocated to the segment and assess its 
performance, and for which discrete financial 
information is available.
  Net Operating Income (‘NOI’) is the key metric 
reported to the CODM for the purposes of 
assessment of the segment results. The same is 
defined as follows:
  Commercial Offices segment:
  NOI for commercial offices is defined as 
Revenue from operations (which includes (i) 
facility rentals, (ii) maintenance services income, 
(iii) income from finance lease, and (iv) other 
operating income for Commercial Offices) less 
Direct operating expenses (which includes (i) 
Operating and maintenance expenses including 
common area maintenance expenses (ii) 
property taxes, (iii) rent, and (iv) insurance).
  Hospitality segment:
  NOI for hospitality segment is defined as 
Revenue from operations (which includes (i) 
323322

(all amounts in H million unless otherwise stated)
room rentals, (ii) sale of food and beverages, 
(iii) other operating income for hospitality 
less Direct operating expenses (which 
includes (i) cost of materials consumed, (ii) 
employee benefits expenses, (iii) Operating 
and maintenance expenses excluding property 
management fees, and (iv) Other expenses).
  Other segment:
  NOI for other segments is defined as Revenue 
from operations (which includes income 
from generation of renewable energy) less 
Direct operating expenses (which includes 
(i) Operating and maintenance and (ii) 
Other expenses).
  Certain income (such as interest, dividend 
and other income) and certain expenses 
(such as Other expenses excluding Direct 
operating expenses, depreciation, amortization, 
impairment and finance cost) are not specifically 
allocable to segments and accordingly these 
expenses are adjusted against the total income 
of the Embassy Office Parks Group.
 y) Cash and cash equivalents
  Cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet comprises of cash at banks and 
on hand, deposits held at call with bank or 
financial institutions, other short-term, highly 
liquid investments with original maturities of 
three months or less that are readily convertible 
to known amounts of cash and which are subject 
to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
 z) Distribution Policy:
  Under the provisions of the REIT Regulations, 
Embassy Office Parks REIT is required to 
distribute to the Unitholders not less than ninety 
percent of the net distributable cash flows 
(‘NDCF’) of Embassy Office Parks REIT. The 
NDCF was calculated in accordance with the 
REIT Regulations and in the manner provided in 
the NDCF framework defined by the Manager. 
The Manager had made certain clarificatory 
amendments to the NDCF framework under 
the Distribution Policy to ensure that there 
is no ambiguity in computing the NDCF at 
Embassy REIT and SPV/Holdco level. The 
amended framework was approved by a special 
majority in the Unitholder’s Meeting held on 8 
July 2021 and was effective from 1 April 2021. 
In order to promote standardisation of framework 
for computing NDCF, a revised framework was 
defined by SEBI vide master circular no. SEBI/
HO/DDHS-PoD-2/P/CIR/2024/43 dated 15 May 
2024. The amended framework was approved 
by the Board of Directors at their meeting 
held on 2 February 2024. This framework 
was applicable with effect from 1 April 2024 
and accordingly, Embassy Office Parks REIT 
had computed the NDCF for the previous 
year. Further, SEBI has amended the NDCF 
framework vide SEBI master circular no. SEBI/
HO/DDHS-PoD-2/P/CIR/2025/99 dated 11 July 
2025 w.e.f 1 April 2025. In accordance with this 
circular, Embassy Office Parks REIT along with 
its SPVs, subject to applicable provisions in 
the Companies Act, 2013, needs to ensure that 
minimum 90% distribution of NDCF be met for 
a given financial year on a cumulative periodic 
basis. The distributions shall be declared and 
paid once every quarter in every financial year.
  The aforesaid net distributable cash flows are 
made available to Embassy Office Parks REIT 
in the form of (i) Interest paid on Shareholder 
Debt provided by Embassy Office Parks REIT 
to the SPV’s/Holding Company, (ii) Principal 
repayment of Shareholder Debt, (iii) Dividend 
declared by the SPVs/Holding Company and (iv) 
Proceeds from sale of any Embassy REIT assets.
 aa) Cash distribution to Unitholders
  The Group recognises a liability to make cash 
distributions to Unitholders when the distribution 
is authorised and a legal obligation has been 
created. As per the REIT Regulations, a distribution 
is authorised when it is approved by the Board of 
Directors of the Manager. A corresponding liability 
in the form of dividend and interest is recognised 
directly in other equity and distribution in the form 
of repayment of capital is recognised directly on 
the face of balance sheet.
 ab) Consolidated Statement of Cash flows
  Consolidated Cash flows are reported using the 
indirect method, whereby Profit/ (loss) before 
share of profit of equity accounted investees and 
tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of 
a non-cash nature and any deferrals or accruals 
of past or future cash receipts or payments. 
The cash flows from operating, investing and 
financing activities of the Embassy Office Parks 
Group are segregated.
  For the purpose of the Consolidated Statement of 
Cash Flow, cash and cash equivalents consist of 
cash and short-term deposits, as defined above, 
as they are considered an integral part of the 
Embassy Office Parks Group’s cash management.
 ac) Earnings per unit
  The basic earnings per unit is computed by 
dividing the net profit/ (loss) attributable to 
the Unitholders of the Trust by the weighted 
average number of units outstanding during 
the reporting period. The number of units 
used in computing diluted earnings/ (loss) 
per unit comprises the weighted average units 
considered for deriving basic earnings/ (loss) 
per unit and also the weighted average number 
of units which could have been issued on the 
conversion of all dilutive potential units.
  Dilutive potential units are deemed converted 
as of the beginning of the reporting date, 
unless they have been issued at a later date. 
In computing diluted earnings per unit, only 
potential equity units that are dilutive and which 
either reduces earnings per share or increase 
loss per units are included.
 ad) Earnings before share of profit of equity 
accounted investee, finance costs, depreciation, 
amortisation, impairment and tax
  The Embassy Office Parks Group has elected 
to present earnings before share of profit 
of equity accounted investee, finance costs, 
depreciation, amortisation, impairment and 
tax as a separate line item on the face of the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. The 
Embassy Office Parks Group measures earnings 
before finance cost, depreciation, amortisation, 
impairment and tax excluding share of profit 
of equity accounted investees on the basis of 
profit/ (loss) from continuing operations. In its 
measurement, the Embassy Office Parks Group 
does not include depreciation, amortisation, 
impairment, finance costs, share of profit of 
equity accounted investees and tax expense.
 ae) Statement of net assets at fair value
  The disclosure of Statement of Net Assets at Fair 
value comprises of the fair values of the properties 
held by Asset SPVs and the HoldCo as well as book 
values of the total liabilities and other assets of all 
SPVs consolidated. The fair value of the property 
held by Asset SPVs and HoldCo are reviewed semi-
annually by the independent property valuer taking 
into consideration market conditions existing at 
the reporting date, and other generally accepted 
market practices. The independent valuer is leading 
independent appraiser with a recognised and 
relevant professional qualification and experience.
 af) Joint development accounting
  Land/development rights received under joint 
development arrangements is measured at the 
fair value of the estimated construction service 
rendered to the landowner and the same is 
accounted on completion of the project. Further, 
non-refundable deposit amount paid by the 
Group under joint development arrangements 
is recognised as Investment property under 
development and on the completion of 
the project, the non-refundable amount is 
transferred as land cost to Investment Property.
 ag) Government Grants
  Government grants are recognised where there 
is a reasonable assurance that the grant will 
be received and all attached conditions will 
be complied with:
  - When the grant relates to an expense 
item, it is recognised as income on a 
systematic basis over the periods that the 
related costs, for which it is intended to 
compensate, are expensed.
  - When the grant relates to an asset, it is 
recognised as income in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss in equal 
amounts over the expected useful life of 
the related asset.
  Repayment of grant relating to income shall be 
applied first against any unamortised deferred 
credit recognised in respect of the grant. To 
the extent that the repayment exceeds any 
such deferred credit, or when no deferred 
credit exists, the repayment shall be recognised 
immediately in profit or loss.
  Repayment of grant related to an asset shall 
be recognised by increasing the carrying 
amount of the asset or reducing the deferred 
income balance by the amount repayable. The 
cumulative additional depreciation that would 
have been recognised in profit or loss to date 
in the absence of the grant shall be recognised 
immediately in profit or loss.

 (a) Terms/ rights attached to Units
  The Trust has only one class of Units. Each Unit represents an undivided beneficial interest in the Trust. Each 
holder of Units is entitled to one vote per unit. The Unitholders have the right to receive at least 90% of the 
Net Distributable Cash Flows of the Trust at least once in every six months in each financial year in accordance 
with the REIT Regulations. The Board of Directors of the Manager approves distributions to Unitholders. The 
distribution will be in proportion to the number of Units held by the Unitholders. The Trust declares and pays 
distributions in Indian Rupees.
  Under the provisions of the REIT Regulations, Embassy Office Parks REIT is required to distribute to Unitholders 
not less than 90% of the net distributable cash flows of Embassy Office Parks REIT for each financial year. 
Accordingly, a portion of the Unitholders’ funds contains a contractual obligation of the Trust to pay cash to 
the Unitholders. Thus, in accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 32 – Financial Instruments: Presentation, 
the Unit Capital should have been classified as compound financial instrument which contains both equity and

PoD-2/P/CIR/2025/99 dated 11 July 2025 issued under the REIT Regulations, require the Unit Capital in entirety 
to be presented/classified as “Equity”, which is at variance from the requirements of Ind AS 32. In order to comply 
with the aforesaid SEBI requirements, the Embassy Office Parks REIT has presented unit capital as equity in 
these financial statements. Consistent with Unitholders’ funds being classified as equity, the distributions to 
Unitholders in the form of interest and dividend is presented in Statement of Changes in Unitholders' Equity 
and distribution to Unitholder in the form of repayment of capital is presented as a seperate line item on face of 
balance sheet and not as finance cost. In line with the above, the dividend payable to Unitholders is recognised 
as liability when the distributions are approved by the Board of Directors of the Investment Manager.
 (b) Unitholders holding more than 5 percent Units in the Trust
 (c) The Trust has not allotted any fully paid-up units by way of bonus units nor has it bought back any class of 
units during the period of five years immediately preceding the balance sheet date. Further, the Trust had 
issued an aggregate of 111,335,400 Units at a price of H331.00 each for consideration other than cash during 
the period of five years immediately preceding the balance sheet date.

weighted average number of units outstanding during the period. Diluted EPU amounts are calculated by dividing 
the profit/(loss) attributable to Unitholders by the weighted average number of units outstanding during the 
period plus the weighted average number of units that would be issued on conversion of all the potential dilutive 
instruments into Unit capital.

 iv) Claims not acknowledged as debt in respect of Property Tax matters
  MPPL:
  (a) The SPV has received a demand order dated 5 October 2015 to pay a demand of Rs.844.66 million 
(Rs.2,739.49 million including penalty and interest upto June 2016) towards the difference in property 
tax payable by the SPV, which difference arose on account of classification of the property under 
different schedules for the purpose of computing property taxes, for the period 2008-09 to 2015-16. 
The SPV is contesting that the concerned property being an industrial estate that has been developed as 
special economic zone must be classified as category XIV as per the notification issued under Karnataka 
Municipal Corporation Act, 1976 ('the Act') and Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagar Palike Property Tax Rules, 
2009 ('Rules'). Whereas, the Assistant Revenue Officer has been considering the concerned property 
under category VIII as per the notification issued under the Act and Rules. The SPV filed a writ petition 
against the demand order which has been dismissed by the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka. The said 
court upheld the demand made by BBMP. Against the order passed by single judge for the dismissal 
of writ petition, MPPL has based on external legal opinion filed an appeal before the aforementioned 
court and the same has been admitted by the court on 27 June 2016. The Hon'ble High Court restrained 
BBMP from taking any coercive action against the SPV and also directed BBMP to allow the SPV to make 
payment of property tax for the assessment year 2016-17. The matter is currently pending as at the date 
of these financial statements. Accordingly, this has been disclosed as a contingent liability. The SPV has 
paid Rs.646.69 million (31 March 2025: Rs.646.69 million) under protest against the above demand. The 
SPV has received a revised demand note dated 27 June 2024 where the updated demand amount is 
Rs.652.20 million (excluding penalty & interest).
  (b) The SPV has also received demand notices dated 9 October 2017 to pay a sum of Rs.760.07 million 
including penalty as of that date towards the differential property tax based on the total survey report for 
certain blocks for the period 2008-09 to 2017-18. An appeal had been filed before the Joint Commissioner, 
BBMP, Bytarayanapura, Bangalore (“Joint Commissioner”) objecting the total survey report and property 
tax assessment notice arising therefrom. New demand notices dated 17 January 2019 were issued to pay 
a sum of Rs.860.39 million (including penalty) towards the differential property tax for the period 2008-
09 to 2017-18 and interest upto the date of payment as per the demand notices. The SPV submitted a 
letter to the Joint Commissioner dated 29 March 2019 referring to the appeals preferred by the SPV 
and had paid a sum of Rs.286.80 million towards property tax demanded under protest. An order was 
passed by the Joint Commissioner dismissing the appeal preferred by the SPV. Against the order passed 
by the Joint Commissioner, MPPL has, based on external legal opinion, filed  a writ petition before  the 
Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka on 3 August 2020 on various grounds, inter alia, that the rates BBMP 
has relied on to calculate property tax in the said demand notices dated 9 October 2017 has been already 
challenged in a writ appeal filed by the SPV and pending before Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka as 
mentioned in note iv(a) above. Additionally new notices dated 24 July 2019 and 18 March 2021 were 
issued to pay a sum of Rs.78.56 million (including penalty) and Rs.27.25 million (including penalty) 
towards the differential property tax for the year 2018-19 and 2019-20 respectively and the SPV has 
paid Rs.35.26 million towards property tax demanded under protest. However, BBMP vide notice dated 
17 June 2021 have returned the demand draft amount of Rs.9.08 million (differential property tax for the 
year 2019 -20 paid) requesting payment of interest and penalty along with the differential tax amounting 
to Rs.27.25 million. The BBMP has issued distress warrant on 1 February 2022 in relation to the above 
said matter with a notice to pay Rs. 727.09 million against which MPPL has obtained an interim stay on 
16 February 2022 from the Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka till the next date of hearing. Pursuant to the 
return of the demand draft amounting to Rs.9.08 million, the SPV has filed an writ petition before the 
Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka for (i)  staying the operation and execution of the demand notices dated 
18 March 2021 and endorsement dated 17 June 2021 and (ii) directing the BBMP to accept the payment 
of differential property tax. The Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka on 30 September 2022 directed the 
BBMP to accept the principal payment of Rs.9.08 million. Basis the order of the Hon'ble High Court of 
Karnataka, MPPL has deposited the principal payment of Rs.9.08 million to BBMP vide letter dated 11 
October 2022 via demand draft.
   Pursuant to the One Time Settlement Scheme promulgated by the State of Karnataka vide government 
order dated 22 February 2024 (OTS Scheme) which allowed for payment of past dues with penalty 
while waiving interest, and based on the representation from BBMP, the SPV has made an under-protest 
payment of Rs.385.47 million (inclusive of one time penalty as per the OTS Scheme) towards the full 
and final satisfaction of the demand notices mentioned above. However, while determining the amount 
payable under the OTS Scheme, the BBMP has not considered a payment of Rs.26.19 million and therefore, 
the SPV has claimed for the credit of this amount. Further, the final amount payable was calculated based 
on BBMP's classification of the property which has been disputed by the SPV as specified at (a) above. 
However, the contingent liability amount for (a) has not been reduced on this account. Accordingly, a net 
contingent liability of Rs.385.47 million (31 March 2025: Rs.385.47 million) has been disclosed in these 
financial statements. Subsequent to the under-protest payment by the SPV, the OTS Scheme has been 
amended to dispense with the payment of penalty along with the interest. The SPV has addressed a letter 
to the BBMP seeking benefit of such amendment in respect of the under-protest payment already made.

works claimed to have been undertaken at the site of Embassy Energy, on the basis of certain

on the basis that the payments are due from ISPL (and/ or its parent entity) to the third party sub-
contractor and not from SPV, and therefore the third party sub-contractor has no claim against SPV. 
By its letters dated 18 March 2019, the third party sub-contractor has responded to the letter from 
SPV, denying all statements made by SPV and reiterating that the unpaid amounts are due from 
SPV. The third party sub-contractor has thereafter filed an application under Section 9 of the Code 
before the Bangalore bench of National Company Law Tribunal claiming debt of Rs.1,082.50 million

referred to as “Respondents”), in relation to the share purchase agreement dated November 17, 
2020 (“SPA”) among the Claimants and the Respondents (on behalf of Embassy REIT). The Interim 
Application alleged that the SPA was void, inter alia, since (i) the Claimants were allegedly not aware 
that Survey no. 9/4, a land parcel located within the ETV Project campus and owned by VTPL since 
2004, was transferred to Embassy REIT as part of the acquisition of 100% of the equity share capital

  To provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the Group has 
classified its financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the accounting standard. An 
explanation of each level is mentioned below:
  Level 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. This includes listed 
equity instruments, traded bonds and mutual funds that have quoted price. The fair value of all equity 
instruments (including bonds) which are traded in the stock exchanges is valued using the closing price as at 
the reporting period. The mutual funds are valued using the closing NAV.
  Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, traded 
bonds, over-the counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of 
observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs 
required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.
  Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is 
included in Level 3.
  Transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3
  There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the half year ended 30 September 2025 
and year ended 31 March 2025.
  Determination of fair values
  Fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure 
purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made 
in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.
  i) The fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities are considered to be equivalent to their 
carrying values.
  ii) The fair values of borrowings at fixed rates are considered to be equivalent to present value of the future 
contracted cashflows discounted at the current market rate. The fair value has been categorised as 
Level 3 Fair value.
45 Operating segments
 Ind AS 108 establishes standards for the way that business enterprises report information about operating 
segments and related disclosures. Based on the ‘management approach’ as defined in Ind AS 108, the Chief 
Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’) evaluates the Embassy Office Parks' performance and allocates resources 
based on an analysis of various performance indicators by operating segments. The accounting principles used in 
the preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are consistently applied to record revenue 
and expenditure in individual segments and are as set out in the significant accounting policies.
 Operating segments of Embassy Office Parks Group are (i) Commercial Offices, (ii) Hospitality and (iii) Other 
segments. Other segments comprise Generation of Renewable Energy. Revenue and identifiable operating 
expenses in relation to segments are categorized based on items that are individually identifiable to that segment.
 Net Operating Income (‘NOI’) is the key metric reported to the CODM for the purposes of assessment of the 
segment results. The same is defined as follows:
 a) Commercial Offices segment:
  NOI for Commercial Offices is defined as revenue from operations (which includes (i) facility rentals, (ii) 
maintenance services income, (iii) income from finance lease, and (iv) other operating income for Commercial 
Offices) less direct operating expenses (which includes (i) operating and maintenance expenses including 
common area maintenance expenses (ii) property taxes, (iii) rent and (iv) insurance).
 b) Hospitality segment:
  NOI for hospitality segment is defined as revenue from operations (which includes (i) room rentals, (ii) sale 
of food and beverages, (iii) other operating income from hospitality) less direct operating expenses (which 
includes (i) cost of materials consumed, (ii) employee benefits expenses, (iii) operating and maintenance 
expenses excluding property management fees and (iv) other expenses).
 c) Other segment:
  NOI for other segments is defined as revenue from operations (which includes income from generation of 
renewable energy) less direct operating expenses (which includes (i) operating and maintenance expenses 
and (ii) other expenses).
  Other income and certain expenses (such as other expenses excluding direct operating expenses, depreciation, 
amortisation, impairment loss and finance cost) are not specifically allocable to segments and accordingly 
these expenses are adjusted against the total income of the Embassy Office Parks Group.
  Further, the information relating to segment assets and segment liabilities are not regularly provided to CODM 
for review and hence the same is not disclosed.

50 Advance paid for co-development of property, including development rights of land (M3 Block B)
 Block B
 During the financial year ended 31 March 2020, to consolidate the M3 land parcel within Embassy Manyata campus, 
MPPL and EPDPL entered into a co-development agreement whereby EPDPL undertook to develop 0.6 msf M3 
Block B warm shell building to be handed over to MPPL by agreed delivery date for a total consideration of H 
7,367.35 million. Furthermore, as per the co-development agreement, during the period of construction, EPDPL 
was obligated to pay interest to MPPL on the amount of the Development Consideration disbursed by MPPL to 
EPDPL. There had been delay in project development as per the planned construction timeline due to delay in the 
acquisition of necessary development rights and receipt of certain regulatory approvals.
 The parties had agreed to utilise a portion of the excess FSI available with MPPL to complete the construction of 
the warm shell building and have received necessary regulatory approvals in this regard. Consequently, pursuant 
to the independent benchmarking reports obtained, the parties reduced the total consideration from H 7,367.35 
million to H 6,658.15 million.
 As per terms of the co-development agreement, consideration is contingent on pre-defined Net Operating Income 
achieved and therefore consideration was trued up/down accordingly upon project completion and final handover.
 MPPL has obtained mortgage of 8.1 acres of land as security against the consideration paid till date.
 During the previous year ended 31 March 2025, the warmshell building has been completed and occupancy 
certificate has been obtained. MPPL has received the final handover of M3 Block B building and true-up has 
been effected. Accordingly, true-up consideration of H 490 million has been paid in accordance with the terms of 
the agreements.

1. Purpose of Valuation
The Report is being prepared to be relied upon by the Reliant Parties and inclusion, as a whole, a summary thereof
or any extracts of the report, in any documents prepared in relation for the disclosure of valuation of assets forming
part of the portfolio of Embassy Office Parks REIT under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Real Estate
Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014 [SEBI (REIT) Regulations], as amended, together with circulars,
clarifications, guidelines and notifications thereunder by SEBI and also disclosure as per fair value accounting under
Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS 40).
2. Valuation Guidelines and Definition
Given the purpose of valuation as mentioned above, the valuation exercise has been carried out to estimate the
“Market Value” of the Subject Properties in accordance with the IVSC International Valuation Standards issued in
2021 and effective from 31 st January 2022.
As per IVS 104, “Market Value” is defined as ‘The estimated amount for which an asset or liability should exchange
on the valuation date between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s -length transaction after proper
marketing and where the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion’.
3. Valuation Approach
The basis of valuation for the Subject Property being Market Value, the same has been derived by the following
approach:
Discounted Cash Flow Method using Rental Reversion 
The market practice in most commercial/ IT developments involves contracting tenants in the form of pre -
commitments at sub -market rentals to increase attractiveness of the property to prospective tenants typically 
extended to anchor tenants. Additionally, there are instances of tenants paying above -market rentals for certain 
properties as well (primarily owing to market conditions at the time of contracting the lease). In order to arrive at a 
unit value for these tenancies, we have considered the impact of such sub/above market leases on the valuation of 
the Subject Property. 
For larger tech parks tenants such as Embassy 247, Embassy TechZone, Embassy Quadron, Embassy Qubix, 
Embassy Manyata, Embassy Golflinks and Embassy Galaxy we have factored a 10% discount on the market rental 
for anchor tenants post lease expiry. 
For the purpose of the valuation of Subject Properties, Income Approach - Discounted Cash Flow Method using 
Rental Reversion has been adopted. 
4. Valuation Methodology
In order to compute the Market Value of the Subject Property the following understanding /assessment is required:
EMBASSY OFFICE PARKS REIT 
L. Anuradha MRICS
(IBBI/RV/02/2022/14979)  
a. Micro Market Assessment where the Subject Property is located.
b. Portfolio Assessment (existing and future supply, demand from occupiers, average office space take up
by an occupier in a particular sector, existing vacancy and the rentals)
c. Situation of the Subject Property (current achievable rentals, vacancy numbers, competing supply in the
micro market etc.) with respect to the micro market.
The details are elaborated below: 
Portfolio & Rental Assessment: 
• The area details, ownership interests of the Subject Property have been provided by the Client.
• Physical site inspections were conducted to assess the current status of the Subject Property.
• The rent rolls along with corresponding leases deeds (on a reasonable sample basis) were reviewed to
identify tenancy characteristics for the Subject Property.
• The current effective rent is weighted average rentals for leased office/ retail  plus other income.
Preparation of Future Cash Flows: 
• Computing the monthly rental income projected and translating the same to a quarterly cash flow.
• The operational expenses of the respective properties are reviewed to understand the recurring, non -
recurring, recoverable and non -recoverable nature expenses and accordingly estimate the margins on the
common area maintenance income, which accrues as cash  inflows to the Subject Property and normalised
for the purpose of cash flow projections.
• The projected future cash flows from the Subject Property are based on existing lease terms for the
operational area till the expiry of the leases or re -negotiation, whichever is earlier, following which, the
lease terms have been aligned with market rents achievable by the Subject Property.
• The cash flows for the operational, under construction and proposed development area have been projected
separately for the purpose of estimating and reporting valuation in accordance with the SEBI (REIT)
Regulations
• For vacant area, under -construction area and proposed development area, the achievable market rent -led
cash flows are projected factoring appropriate lease-up time frame for vacant/under-construction/proposed
development area.

• Recurring operational expenses, fit -out income (wherever applicable, however, the same has not been
included in the NOI for the purpose of arriving at the terminal value by capitalisation) and vacancy
provision have been adopted in-line with prevalent market practices and conditions.
• In addition, appropriate rent -free periods have been adopted during lease roll -overs to consider potential
rent-free terms as well as outflows towards brokerage.
• These cash flows have been projected for 10 -year duration from the date of valuation wherein 11th year
Net operating income (NOI) is capitalized for the assessment of terminal value. These future cash flows
are then discounted to present -day value (valuati on date) at an appropriate discount rate to arrive at the
Market Value of the Subject Property.
5. Information Sources
The Subject P roperty related information for the valuation exercise have been provided by the client , unless
otherwise mentioned. The documents provided have been assumed to be a true copy of the original. The rent rolls 
have been cross- checked with the lease deeds on a sample basis only to ensure its correctness.

construction in accordance with the SEBI (REIT) regulations as it has not received the Occupancy Certificate as on

and Proposed buildings are expected to be completed by FY 2030. 
Locational Advantage 
The Subject Property falls in the Pallavaram Thoraipakkam corridor geographically, However, since the region is 
an emerging corridor as detailed below and Embassy having a first mover advantage there is no direct comparable 
of a similar development to the subject property in the same corridor for benchmarking. Hence, we have considered 
the Suburban South, which is a more established market and has bench mark competing developments in the area.  
The subject property has added advantage of being near the international airport and GST road and the OMR  and 
further the proposed metro station.

1. Cap Rate - Office
Capitalization rate (“Cap rate”) is a real estate industry metric referring to the ratio of the Net Operating Income (NOI) ar ising rental income to their 
gross asset value, indicating the expected income yield of the investor from concerned property. It re flects the expectation of the investor on stability 
of rental income driven by the asset quality, tenant profile, market demand-supply dynamics and macro-economic expectations on prevailing risk free/ 
low risk interest rates.  
The capitalization rate adopted for valuing various assets has been based on factors such as:  
• Relevant parameters of some key investments in comparable properties of similar quality, use, tenant profile made by institut ional real estate
investors were perused. Further, considering that these investments have been made through private equity and the  subject valuation is being
carried out for public listing with better liquidity / marketability of ownership interest, the cap rate for the Subject Property was suitably adjusted.
The selected comparable investments consist of investment -grade A properties with a similar tenant profile, commercial usage backed by
institutional investors. These properties primarily include large office parks, aligning closely with the characteristics  of the REIT properties.
Considering these criteria, following comparable transactions have been analyzed to derive the capitalization rate:
• **Includes c.75,000 SF area under development that was expected to be operational by September  30, 2023.
• Source: Secondary Market Research
• Note: The above information is based on information published in public domain and discussions with various market players.
EMBASSY OFFICE PARKS REIT 
L. Anuradha MRICS
(IBBI/RV/02/2022/14979)  
Based on these considerations, an exit capitalisation rate ranging between 7.50% and 8.25% has been adopted, with the lower end of the range applied 
to assets demonstrating superior performance and fundamentals within the portfolio. The cap rate considered for the valuation of subject properties has 
been captured in the specific subject property section. 
2. Capitalization Rate Assumptions - Hospitality Development
Hotels are undisputedly a combination of business and real estate; the day-to-day operation of a hotel represents a business over and above the real estate
value. The exercise is aimed at assessing the value of the property on the earnings generating capac ity of the hotel. As per discussions with the Client,
we understand that the investors are investing with a view of future earnings and not for the purpose of selling the assets i n the present time. Hence the
most appropriate method is the EV/EBITDA Multiple approach.
For this method, we have evaluated the historical data of publicly listed large and medium -sized hotel companies and calculated an average multiple. 
The average/median EV/EBITDA multiple from FY 2012 to FY 2025 ranges from 15 to 20. Many of these companies own multiple operational assets 
across various regions, with some also holding management contracts. Given that our subject property is a standalone asset, w e have applied an 
EV/EBITDA multiple of 14, which aligns with investor return expectations for standalone properties, resulting in a 7.14% capitalization rate.

3. Discount Rate
The discount rate applied to the available cash flows reflects the opportunity cost to all the capital providers,
namely shareholders (Cost of Equity) and creditors (Cost of Debt), weighted by the relative contribution to the 
total capital of the company ( WACC). The opportunity cost to the capital provider equals the rate of return the 
capital provider expects to earn on other investments of equivalent risk. 
• Cost of Debt
The cost of debt is the return that a company provides to its debtholders and creditors. These capital
providers need to be compensated for any risk exposure that comes with lending to a company. The cost
of debt for real estate assets is often influenced by the stage of development of the asset. The mature and
income-generating assets are considered less risky, leading to lower interest rates. In this context, the cost
of debt for Embassy REIT properties is benchmarked to the interest rates observed in REI Ts, as all bear
similar characteristics in terms of type and development status of properties. Since a major portion of
REITs' portfolios consists of completed, income -generating assets, the cost of debt aligns more closely
with the Lease Rent Discounting (LRD) rate.
This approach ensures that the cost of debt is aligned with the risk profile of the property and current
market conditions,
Please find below Cost of Debt for Comparable REIT.
Entity Name Cost of Debt 
Embassy REIT (June 2025) 7.5% 
Brookfield REIT (June 2025) 8.1% 
Mindspace REIT (June 2025) 7.8% 
Knowledge REIT (June 
2025) 8.9% 
  Source: Analyst Presentation for respective REIT 
The cost of debt for September 2025 valuation has been taken at 8.4 % basis the range of cost of debt for 
the REITs as mentioned in the above table.

for commercial office. Apart from that we have also benchmarked CAPM model and inputs of same is
detailed out as under
a. We have considered risk free rate of 6.96% based on average 10-year treasury bond yield.
b. For calculation of beta, we have benchmarked industry (Nifty Realty Index). We have considered
average 5-year Beta of Nifty Realty index with respect to Nifty 50.

• Debt-Equity Ratio (weightage of WACC)
As discussed earlier, the cost of debt has been derived based on prevailing LRD rates, while the cost of
equity has been calibrated to account for both asset -specific and market -specific factors, reflecting
investor expectations from an operational Grade A  office spaces. Additionally, the debt -to-equity mix
has been determined considering the typical LRD tenures and the extent to which debt financing
contributes to the overall asset value.
It may be noted basis management representation that the current debt equity structure of Embassy REIT
is 49:51 and planned debt equity structure for Embassy REIT is 45:55.
However, SEBI REIT Regulations states that the maximum permissible limit for debt is 49%. Hence, we
have considered the debt and equity mix of 45% and 55% which lies well within the limit specified as
per the SEBI REIT Regulations and is also accepted by the market participants.
Derivation of WACC - Operational 
Based on the above, the following WACC rate has been assumed for completed commercial assets part of the 
Embassy REIT: 
Particulars Cost Weightage WACC 
Debt 8.4% 45.0% 
~11.75% 
Equity 14.5% 55.0% 
Derivation of WACC – Under Construction 
• Cost of debt for under construction properties is considered based on prevailing Construction finance rates at 10%.
• Additionally, the proportion of debt and equity has been derived considering the leverage extended for construction
of Grade A office developments based on industry benchmarks and feedback received from financial institutions.
• The derived discount rate of 13% is arrived basis the assumption that the properties would have a higher discount
rate during the construction period and would be normalized post construction to 11.75%.

Annexure 2: Extract of Methodology & Key Assumptions for the Valuation of Properties 
Note: The Properties has been referred to as “Subject Properties” by the valuer. Similar 
representation has been followed in this section.  
Valuation Approach and Methodology 
• PURPOSE OF VALUATION
The purpose of this valuation exercise is to estimate the value of the Subject Properties
as part of the portfolio of Embassy Office Parks REIT, for reporting purposes under the
SEBI (Real Estate Investment Trust) Regulations, 2014, as amended, together with
clarifications, guidelines and notifications thereunder and also disclosure requirement
of fair valuation of investment properties as per SEBI.
• VALUATION GUIDELINE AND DEFINITION
Given the purpose of valuation as mentioned above, the valuation exercise has been
carried out to estimate the “Market Value” of the Subject Properties in accordance with
the IVSC International Valuation Standards issued in 2021 and effective from 31
January 2022.
As per IVSC International Valuation Standards, “Market Value” is defined as ‘ The
estimated amount for which an asset or liability should exchange on the valuation date
between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s -length transaction after proper
marketing and where the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without
compulsion.’
• VALUATION APPROACH
The basis of valuation for the Subject Properties  being Market Value, the same has
been derived by the following approach:
Discounted Cash Flow Method using Rental Reversion
The market practice in most commercial/ IT developments involves contracting tenants in
the form of pre -commitments at sub -market rentals to increase attractiveness of the
property to prospective tenants typically extended to anchor tenants. Additionally, there are
instances of tenants paying above -market rentals for certain properties as well (primarily
owing to market conditions at the time of contracting the lease). In order to arrive at a unit
value for these tenancies, we have considered the impact of such sub/above market leases
on the valuation of the Subject Properties.
For the purpose of the valuation of Subject Properties, Income Approach - Discounted
Cash Flow Method using Rental Reversion has been adopted.
• VALUATION METHODOLOGY
In order to compute the Market Value of the Subject Properties the following understanding 
/assessment is required: 
a. Micro Market Assessment where the Subject Properties is located.
561560
Half-Yearly Report FY2025-26SECTION 05 INDEPENDENT PROPERTY CONSULTANT REVIEW REPORT
Embassy Office Parks REIT/ EOPMSPL 
Independent Property Consultant Report 
November 2025 
 Embassy Office Parks REIT/ EOPMSPL    Cushman & Wakefield   
b. Portfolio Assessment (existing and future supply, demand from occupiers, average office
space take up by an occupier in a particular sector, existing vacancy and the rentals)
c. Situation of the Subject Properties  (current achievable rentals, vacancy numbers,
competing supply in the micro market etc.) with respect to the micro market.
The details are elaborated below:  
Portfolio & Rental Assessment: 
• The area details, ownership interests of the Subject Properties have been provided by the
Client.
• Physical site inspections were conducted to assess the current status of the Subject
Properties.
• The rent rolls along with corresponding leases deeds (on a reasonable sample basis) were
reviewed to identify tenancy characteristics for the Subject Properties.
• The current effective rent is weighted average rentals for leased office/ retail plus other
income.
Preparation of Future Cash Flows: 
• Computing the monthly rental income projected and translating the same to a quarterly cash
flow.
• The operational expenses of the respective properties are reviewed to understand the
recurring, non-recurring, recoverable and non -recoverable nature expenses and accordingly
estimate the margins on the common area maintenance income, which accrues as cash
inflows to the Subject Properties and normalised for the purpose of cash flow projections
• The projected future cash flows from the Subject Properties are based on existing lease terms
for the operational area till the expiry of the leases or re -negotiation, whichever is earlier,
following which, the lease terms have been aligned with market rents achievable by the
Subject Properties.
• The cash flows for the operational, under construction and proposed development area have
been projected separately for the purpose of estimating and reporting valuation in accordance
with the SEBI (REIT) Regulations
• For vacant area, under -construction area and proposed development area, the achievable
market rent -led cash flows are projected factoring appropriate lease -up time frame for
vacant/under-construction/proposed development area.
• Recurring operational expenses, fit-out income (wherever applicable, however, the same has
not been included in the NOI for the purpose of arriving at the terminal value by capitalisation)
and vacancy provision have been adopted in -line with prevalent mark et practices and
conditions.
• In addition, appropriate rent -free periods have been adopted during lease roll -overs to
consider potential rent-free terms as well as outflows towards brokerage.
• These cash flows have been projected for 10-year duration from the date of valuation wherein
11th year Net operating income (NOI) is capitalized for the assessment of terminal value.
These future cash flows are then discounted to present -day value (valuati on date) at an
appropriate discount rate to arrive at the Market Value of the Subject Properties.
