INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REVIEW REPORT ON CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED 
QUARTERLY AND YEAR TO DATE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THE COMPANY 
PURSUANT TO THE REGULATION 33 OF SEBI (LISTING OBLIGATIONS AND 
DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS) REGULATIONS, 2015, AS AMENDED 
® TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF 
MODI NATURALS LIMITED 
1. o) 
We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Unaudited Financial Results of 
MODI NATURALS LIMITED (the “Company™ or “Parent”) and its subsidiary (the Parent and its 
subsidiary together referred to as the “Group™). being submitted by the Parent pursuant to the 
requirement of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, as amended. 
This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Parent’s Management and approved by the 
Parent’s Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial 
Reporting” (“Ind AS 34”), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act.2013 read with 
relevant rules issued there under and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our 
responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent 
Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). A review 
of Interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of Parent’s personnel 
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review 
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with 
Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013 and 
consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant 
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly. we do not express an audit opinion. 
We also performed procedures in accordance with the circular issued by the SEBI under Regulation 
33(8) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as 
amended, to the extent applicable. 
The Statement includes the results of its one subsidiary company named Modi Biotech Private 
Limited (100% Holding). 
Based on our review conducted and procedures stated in paragraph 3 above and based on be 
considerations of the review report of other auditor referred to in paragraph six below. nothing has 
come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Un- 
audited Financial Results, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles 
laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standard and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 
33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended, 
including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.

6. We did not review the financial results of its subsidiary company included in the consolidated 
unaudited financial results, whose financial results reflect total revenues of Rs. 8482.05 lacs; total 
net profit after tax of Rs.744.51 lacs and total comprehensive profit of Rs.745.86 Lacs and the total 
assets of Rs.26030.24 lacs for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, as considered in the Statement. 
These financial results have been reviewed by other auditor whose report has been furnished to us by 
the Management and our conclusion on the Statement, in so far as it relates to the amounts and 
disclosures included in respect of these subsidiary, is based solely on the reports of the other auditor 
and the procedures performed by us as stated in paragraph 3 above. 
Our conclusion on the Statement is not modified in respect of this matter.
