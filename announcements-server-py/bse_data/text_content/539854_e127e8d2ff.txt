and Disclosure Requirements) Regulationq 2015, as amended
To the Board of Directors of
Halder Venture Limited
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Standalone Unaudited Financial Results of
Halder Venture Limited (the "Company") for the quarter and half year ended September 30,2025
(the "Statement") attached herewith, being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirement of
Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations,20l5,as
amended (the'Listing Regulations').
The Company's Management is responsible forthe preparation of the Statement in accordance with
the recognition and measurement principles laid down in lndian Accounting Standard 34, (Ind AS 34)
"Interim Financial Reporting" prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act,2013 as amended,
read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India
and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. The Statement has been approved
by the Company's Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement
based on our review.
We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with tl-re Standard on Review Engagements
(SRE) 2410, "Review of lnterim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the
Entity" issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of lndia. This standard requires that we plan
and perfonn the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the Statement is free of material
misstatement. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of
persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
Standards on Ar-rditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would
become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not
express an audit opinion.
Based on our review conducted as above, notliing has come to our attention that causes us to believe
that tl-re accompanying Staternent, prepared in accordance with tl,e recognition and measurement
principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standards ('Ind AS') specified under Section
133 of the Companies Act, 2013 as amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other
accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be
disclosed in tenns of the Listing Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or
that it contains any material misstatement.

Financial Results of the'Com'pany pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI-(Listing Obligations
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended
To the Board of Directors of
Halder Venture Limited
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Unaudited Financial Results of
Halder Venture Limited (the "Parent") and its subsidiaries (the Parent and its subsidiaries together
referred to as "the Group"), for the quarter and half year ended September 30,2025 (the "Statement")
attached herewith, being submitted by the Parent pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the
SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended ('Listing
Regulations').
The Parent's Management is responsible for the preparation of the Statement in accordance with the
recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, (Ind AS 34)
"Interim Financial Repofiing" prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act,2013 as amended,
read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India
and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. The Statement has been approved
by the Parent's Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement
based on our review.
We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements
(SRE) 2410, "Review of lnterim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the
Entity" issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of lndia. This standard requires that we plan
and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the Statement is free of material
misstatement. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of
persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would
become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not
express an audit opinion.
2.
We also performed procedures in accordance with the Master Circular issued by the Securities and
Exchange Board of India under Regulation 33(8) of the Listing Regulations, to the extent applicable.
4. The Statement includes the resr-rlts of the entities as mentioned in Annexr-rre-1.

Based on ollr review cor-rducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above, nothing has
come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in
with the
A,.qq4qlg !tap{a4!q ('In4 AqJ lpe_qqled under Section 113 ql_!E_ Co4qpa4199.{9!, 2Q!3 .as
amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principies generally
accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of the Listing
Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material
misstatement.
6. We draw attentiot't to note 6 andl of the Statement which describes the unavailability of reviewed
interim financial statements and otherfinancial information inrespect of two (2) subsidiaries and five
(5) step-down subsidiaries. The consolidated unaudited finar-rcial results include the financial results
of two (2) subsidiaries and five (5) step-down subsidiaries which are located outside India and have
not been reviewed by their auditors, whose financial results before consolidation adjustments reflect
total assets of Rs.1BB5B.4B lakhs as at September 30,2025, total revenue of Rs.2679.14 lakhs and
Rs.5898.24 lakhs, total net loss after tax of Rs.895.01 lakhs and Rs.1010.15 lakhs and total
comprehensive loss of Rs.895.01 lakhs and Rs.1010.15 lakhs for the quarter ended September 30,
2025 and forthe half year ended September 30,2025,respectively ar-rd cash flows (net) of Rs.928.06
lakhs for the l-ialf year ended September 30,2025.In our view, in order to strengthen corporate
governance, the interirn finar-rcial statements of these subsidiaries which have been prepared by the
management of the respective entities, should have been reviewed by their auditors before the same
was included in the accompanying Statement. Our conclusion on the Statement is not modified in
respect of the above matter.
