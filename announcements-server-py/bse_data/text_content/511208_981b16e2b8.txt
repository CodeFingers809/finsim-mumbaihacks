Dear Sir / Madam, 
Subject: Update on Non-Compliance with Regulation 33 — Delay in Submission of 
Consolidated Financial Results for Quarter Ended June 30, 2025 and 
Subsequent Developments 
This letter is being submitted as a consolidated update, further to our earlier communications 
and in response to the notices issued by Bombay Stock Exchange (‘BSE’) and National Stock 
Exchange (‘NSE’) [Both collectively be referred to as “the Stock Exchanges”], regarding 
non-compliance with Regulation 33 of the SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015 (“SEBI LODR 
Regulations”) due to the delay in submitting the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results 
for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, and the consequent action for levying fines and proposed 
freezing of the promoter demat accounts. 
As required, we wish to update the Stock Exchanges on the discussions and observations of 
the Board of Directors of IL&FS Investment Managers Limited (“the Company”) at their 
meeting held on November 13, 2025, wherein the matter was placed in detail. 
1. Background — Regulatory Requirement and Non-Submission 
(a) Under Regulation 33 of SEBI LODR Regulations, the Company was required 
to submit its Unaudited Standalone and Consolidated Financial Results for the 
quarter ended June 30, 2025, along with the Limited Review Report, by 
August 14, 2025. 
(b) The Standalone Financial Results were duly approved by the Board and filed 
with the Stock Exchanges on August 14, 2025, within the prescribed timeline. 
(c) The Consolidated Financial Results could not be completed and submitted due 
to non-receipt of the Board-approved Unaudited Financial Results and Limited 
Review Report from the Company’s subsidiary, Andhra Pradesh Urban 
Infrastructure Asset Management Limited (“APUIAML”). 
(d APUIAML informed that it was unable to convene its Board Meeting due to 
the continued unavailability of its Directors—senior Government officials of 
the State of Andhra Pradesh (Chief Secretary and Principal Secretaries)—who
3. 
were occupied with State-level review meetings and Government 
commitments. 
(e) The Company made a disclosure under Regulation 30 on August 14, 2025, 
informing the Stock Exchanges of the delay and its underlying reason. 
Continuous Follow-Up and Escalation with APUIAML — July to August 2025 
The Company began its consolidation process well in advance and undertook 
persistent follow-up actions with APUTAML beginning July 03, 2025, including: 
(a) Initial request on July 03, 2025: Request for first-cut of financials and 
thereafter signed financials with Limited Review Report for consolidation 
purpose. 
(b) Multiple reminders — July 30 to August 12, 2025: 
Emails were sent on July 30, August 04, August 05, August 06, and August 12 
requesting Board-approved financials of APUIAML, signed Limited Review 
Report, and confirmation of the Board meeting date. 
APUIAML officials responded explaining Independence Day week 
commitments, Secretariat-level meetings, Senior Government officers being 
unavailable, Change of CEO at APUIAML, pending internal audit cycles etc. 
() High-level escalation — August 18 to August 26, 2025: 
Emails on August 18, August 22, August 24, and August 26 included: 
o Requests to schedule the Board Meeting, 
o Attempts to arrange a meeting between IIML CEO and APUIAML CEO, 
o APUIAML s assurance that the matter was escalated to Principal Secretary 
and Chief Secretary. 
Despite repeated escalation, APUIAML remained unable to convene its Board 
Meeting. 
Notices from Stock Exchanges & Company’s Responses 
The Stock Exchanges issued: 
o September 15, 2025 notices levying fines, and 
o October 01, 2025 notices (enclosed) proposing freezing of promoter shareholding, 
among other actions. 
Detailed responses submitted by the Company on September 19, 2025, October 06, 
2025, and October 13, 2025 explaining: 
o Impossibility of Performance: The delay in filing the Consolidated Financial 
Results arose solely due to the non-receipt of financial results from our subsidiary, 
without which consolidation could not be completed. This circumstance 
constituted an impossibility of performance and was entirely beyond the 
Company’s control.
Full Compliance with Disclosure Obligations: The Company has fully complied 
with its obligations under Regulation 30 of the SEBI (LODR) Regulations by 
making timely disclosures regarding the reasons for the delay. 
Subsidiary-Related Constraints: The delay stemmed from administrative and 
operational constraints at APUIAML, including repeated postponements of its 
Board Meetings. Despite continuous engagement with APUIAML and its 
auditors, the Company was unable to obtain the requisite information within the 
prescribed timelines. 
Good-Faith Conduct by the Company: The Company reiterated that the delay 
was neither deliberate nor attributable to any lapse on the part of IIML. All steps 
were taken in good faith to expedite the submission of the subsidiary’s results and 
consequent consolidation. 
Request against Freezing of Promoter Shareholding: In light of the above, the 
Company requested that the promoter shareholding not be subjected to fieezing, 
as the circumstances leading to the delay were neither intentional nor attributable 
to the Company and the delay was solely attributable to the impossibility of 
performance due to circumstances beyond the Company’s control, and not due to 
any default, negligence, or willful omission 
Opportunity for Personal Hearing: The Company further requests that, prior to 
any punitive action, it be granted an opportunity of personal hearing in accordance 
with the principles of natural justice. 
. Follow-up Notes to APUIAML — October 2025 
The Company undertook continuous follow-ups with APUIAML for early completion 
of its financial statements and communicated the regulatory implications of the delay 
through multiple correspondences. The correspondence emphasized the potential 
regulatory consequences, including imposition of fines, freezing of promoter 
shareholdings, and possible suspension of trading of the Company’s securities, and 
requested that APUIAML’s Audit Committee and Board take necessary action to 
ensure timely compliance. 
(@) 
(b) 
Detailed Note dated October 10, 2025 
The Company sent a comprehensive note to titled: “Non-Compliance with 
Regulation 33 — Non-Submission of Consolidated Financial Statements for Q1 
FY 2025-26”. The note highlighted the regulatory consequences including 
freezing of promoter demat accounts and possible suspension of trading, and 
requested APUIAML to place the note before its Audit Committee and Board 
to ensure timely completion of financial statements and compliance with 
applicable SEBI regulations. 
Reminder dated October 15, 2025 
The Company urged APUIAML to urgently finalise and approve its Limited 
Review Results for June 30, 2025, and commence preparation of financials for 
September 2025 to avoid repeat non-compliance.
5. Board’s Observations and Comments — Meeting Held on November 13, 2025 
A comprehensive background note was placed before the Board detailing: 
Regulatory requirements, 
Timeline of follow-ups (July—October 2025), 
Copies of all emails exchanged with APUIAML, 
All notices received from Exchanges and detailed replies submitted thereto 
Detailed note dated October 10 and reminder dated October 15. 
Board Observations and Comments: 
After detailed review of the material placed, the Board of Directors made the 
following observations: 
1. The delay in submission of the Consolidated Financial Results was solely 
attributable to circumstances beyond the control of the Company, specifically 
the inability of APUIAML to convene its Board Meeting and approve its 
Limited Review Results, owing to unavailability of Government-nominated 
Directors 
The Company has acted diligently, maintaining continuous follow-up with 
APUIAML and ensuring full transparency through timely disclosures to the 
Stock Exchanges. 
There is no lapse, negligence, or omission on part of the Company, and the 
situation constituted a bona fide case of impossibility of performance under 
Regulation 33(3)(b) of the SEBI LODR Regulations and thus no lapse, 
negligence, or omission can be attributed to the Company. 
The Company’s follow up emails/ reminders to APUIAMAL, detailed 
response dated September 19, 2025, October 06, 2025 and October 13, 2025 in 
response to the Notices issued by Stock exchanges on September 15, 2025 (for 
levying fines) and October 01, 2025 (for proposed fieezing of promoters 
demat account), as well as the follow-up note and communications sent to 
APUIAML on October 10 and October 15, 2025, were duly noted and 
endorsed by the Board. 
The Board advised the management to continue engaging with APUTAML and 
its auditors to ensure early completion of APUIAML’s quarterly financial 
statements and avoid recurrence of such delays going forward. 
The Board authorised the Company to apprise the Stock Exchanges of its 
observations and to reiterate the Company’s request for Non-fieezing of 
promoter demat accounts and Non-levy of fines and coercive action; 
6. Final Development — Receipt of APUIAML Financials and Completion of 
Consolidation 
Following the above developments, the Company received the Board-approved 
Unaudited Financial Results and Limited Review Report of APUIAML necessary for 
consolidation.
Upon receipt: 
o The Company immediately undertook and completed Group consolidation; 
o The Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 
were placed before and approved by the Board of Directors at the same meeting 
held on November 13, 2025. 
The Consolidated Financial Results have since been submitted to the Stock 
Exchanges. In respect of the SOP-related fines, the Company will be submitting a 
detailed waiver application to the Stock Exchanges, requesting relief in view of the 
circumstances that led to the delay. 
In accordance with the Board’s directions, we hereby place on record that: 
e The Consolidated Financial Results have now been duly completed, approved and 
submitted with the Stock Exchanges 
e The delay was neither intentional nor attributable to the Company. 
« We once again request the Exchanges not to take penal measures, including freezing 
of promoter shareholding. 
The Company remains committed to ensuring timely and transparent compliance. 
You are requested to kindly take the above information including Board’s observations and 
comments on record as required under the Notices issued by Stock Exchanges on October 01, 
2025. 
Thanking you, 
Yours faithfully, 
For IL&FS Investment Managers Limited
