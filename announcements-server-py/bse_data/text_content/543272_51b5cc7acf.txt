Independent Auditor’s Review Report on Consolidated Unaudited Quarterly Financial Results and Year 
to Date Results of the Company pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) 
  
   To the Board of Directors of Easy Trip Planners Limited 
 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of consolidated unaudited financial results (‘the Statement’) 
of Easy Trip Planners Limited (‘the Holding Company’) and its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its 
subsidiaries together referred to as ‘the Group’) and its associates, (refer Annexure 1 for the list of 
subsidiaries and its associates, included in the Statement) for the quarter ended 30 September 2025 and 
the consolidated year to date results for the period 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025 being submitted by 
the Holding Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) (‘Listing Regulations’).  
 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Holding Company’s management and approved by the 
Holding Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting (‘Ind AS 
34’), prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’), and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India and is in compliance with the presentation and disclosure requirements of 
Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement 
based on our review. 
 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 
2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists of making 
inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and 
other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with 
the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act, and consequently, does not enable 
us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an 
audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
 
We also performed procedures in accordance with the circular CIR/CFD/CMD1/44/2019 dated 29 March 
2019 issued by the SEBI under Regulation 33 (8) of the Listing Regulations, to the extent applicable. 
 
4. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above, nothing has 
come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance 
with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under section 133 of 
the Act, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information 
required to be disclosed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations, 
including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.

5. We did not review the interim financial information of nineteen(19) subsidiaries included in the Statement, 
whose financial information reflects total assets of INR 4,440.56 million as at 30 September 2025, total 
revenues of INR 689.21 million  and  INR 1,306.04 million, total net loss after tax of INR 67.26 million and 
INR 59.75 Million, total comprehensive loss of INR 58.86 million and INR 73.57 million, for the quarter and 
six-month period ended on 30 September 2025 respectively, cash flow(net) of INR (4.37) million for the 
period ended 30 September 2025, as considered in the Statement. These interim financial information have 
been reviewed by other auditors whose review reports have been furnished to us by the management, and 
our conclusion in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries 
is based solely on the review reports of such other auditors and the procedures performed by us as stated 
in paragraph 3 above. 
 
Our conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter with respect to our reliance on the work done by and 
the reports of the other auditors. 
 
6. The Statement includes the Group’s share of net loss after tax of INR 7.22 million and INR 13.60 million, 
and total comprehensive loss of INR 7.22 million and INR 13.60 million for the quarter and six-months period 
ended on 30 September 2025 respectively, in respect of three (3) associates, based on their interim financial 
information, which have not been reviewed/audited by their auditors, and have been furnished to us by the 
Holding Company’s management. Our conclusion on the Statement, in so far as it relates to the amounts 
and disclosures included in respect of these associates, are based solely on such unaudited/unreviewed 
interim financial information. According to the information and explanations given to us by the management, 
this interim financial information are not material to the Group. 
 
Our conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter with respect to our reliance on the financial 
information certified by the Board of Directors.

Independent Auditor’s Review Report on Standalone Unaudited Quarterly Financial Results and Year 
to Date Financial Results of the Company pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) 
To the Board of Directors of Easy Trip Planners Limited  
 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of standalone unaudited financial results (‘the Statement’) 
of Easy Trip Planners Limited  (‘the Company’) for the quarter ended 30 September 2025 and the year to 
date results for the period 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025 being submitted by the Company pursuant 
to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015 (as amended) (‘Listing Regulations’).  
 
2. The Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company’s management and approved by the Company’s 
Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid 
down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting (‘Ind AS 34’), prescribed under section 
133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’), and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and 
is in compliance with the presentation and disclosure requirements of Regulation 33 of the Listing 
Regulations. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements 
(SRE) 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists 
of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying 
analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in 
accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act, and consequently, 
does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might 
be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
 
4. Based on our review conducted as above ,nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that 
the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles 
laid down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under section 133 of the Act, and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in accordance with the 
requirements of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, 
or that it contains any material misstatement.
