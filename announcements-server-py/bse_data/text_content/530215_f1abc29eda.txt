 Srikakulam/Vizag, Andhra Pradesh – November 17, 2025: 
 Kings Infra Ventures Ltd. (KIVL), a pioneer in sustainable aquaculture since 1987, has announced a strategic

Following the submission of a Letter of Intent (LoI) to the Government of Andhra Pradesh, Kings Infra

held detailed meetings with the District Collector of Srikakulam and the MRO to identify 500 acres of 
suitable land for the project. 
These discussions focused on:

Formal agreements with all stakeholders will be executed once land identification and statutory clearances 
are completed, ensuring a structured and legally compliant framework for project execution.
