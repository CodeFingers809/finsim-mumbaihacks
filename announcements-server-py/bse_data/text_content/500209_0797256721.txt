Notice to Shareholders in the United States:
  
1) The Buyback is in relation to the securities of an Indian company and is subject to Indian laws and disclosure requirements. 
It is important for Shareholders in the United States (U.S.) to be aware that this document is subject to tender offer laws 
and regulations in India, which are different from those in the U.S.; and has been prepared in accordance with Indian format 
and style, which differs from customary U.S. format and style. Financial  information included in this Letter of Offer or in 
other documents relating to the Buyback has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Indian 
Accounting Standards notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, and thus may not be 
comparable to financial information of companies in the U.S. or other companies whose financial statements are prepared 
in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The Buyback will remain open for a fixed period of 5 
 
 
13 
 
Working Days as required under Regulation 9(vi) of the Buyback Regulations and not a minimum of 20 U.S. business days 
as prescribed by Rules 13e-4 and 14e-1 under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“ Exchange Act”). The 
Buyback will be conducted in the U.S. pursuant to an order granting exemptions from Rules 13e4(f)(1)(i), 13e-4(f)(3), 13e-
4(f)(8)(i), and 14e -1(a) under the Exchange Act granted by the SEC, and will otherwise be in accordance with the 
requirements of the Exchange Act, the Act, the relevant rules framed thereunder, including the Share Capital Rules and the 
Management Rules, to the extent applicable, and the Buyback Regulations. For details of the exemptive relief obtained by 
the Company from the SEC, see the section titled “Details of Statutory Approvals” on page 47 of this Letter of Offer. 
2) The receipt of cash pursuant to the Buyback by an Eligible Shareholder may be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal 
income tax purposes and under applicable state and local, as well as foreign and other, tax laws. Each Eligible Shareholder 
is urged to consult their independent professional advisor immediately regarding the tax consequences of acceptance of the 
Offer. 
3) It may be difficult for Shareholders in the U.S. to enforce their rights and any claims they may have arising under the U.S. 
federal securities laws in connection with the Buyback, since the Company is incorporated in a country other than the U.S. 
and some or all of its officers and directors may be residents of a country other than the United States. Shareholders in the 
U.S. may not be able to sue the Company or its officers or directors in a non -U.S. court for violations of U.S. securities 
laws. Further, it may be difficult to compel the Company or its affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction or 
judgment of a U.S. court. 
4) Neither the SEC nor any state securities commission of the U.S. has approved or disapproved the Buyback or passed any 
comment upon the adequacy or completeness of this Letter of Offer. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence 
in the U.S. 
5) The Company expresses no opinion as to whether the Eligible Shareholders should participate in the Offer and, accordingly, 
Eligible Shareholders are advised to consult their own advisors to consider participation in the Offer.  
This Letter of Offer is being sent to Eligible Shareholders by email (and, if so requested by any shareholder (including U.S. 
shareholders), or if any U.S. shareholder has not registered an email address with the Depositories,  or if any ADS holder (as of 
the date of dissemination of this  Letter of Offer) so requests, a physical form shall be couriered to such shareholder’s or ADS 
holder’s registered postal address as available with the Company).

jurisdiction outside India. Recipients of this Letter of Offer resident in jurisdictions outside India should inform themselves of 
and observe any applicable legal requirements. This Buyback is not directed towards any person or entity in any jurisdiction or 
country where the same would be contrary to the applicable laws or regulations. This Letter of Offer does not in any way 
constitute an offer to sell, or an invitation to sell, any securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer or invitation is  not 
authorized, or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such offer, or solicitation which would subject the Company or the 
Manager to the Buyback to any new or additional requirements or registrations . Potential users of the information contained in 
this Letter of Offer are requested to inform themselves about and to observe any applicable legal requirements or restrictions.  
This Letter of Offer has been prepared for the purposes of compliance with the Buyback Regulations. Accordingly, the 
information disclosed herein may not be the same as that which would have been disclosed if this document had been prepared 
in accordance with the laws and regulations of any jurisdiction outside of India. The Company and the Manager to the Buyback

not restricted to, registration of this Letter of Offer under any local securities laws), shall not be treated by such Shareholders as 
an offer being made to them. Any Shareholder who tenders his, her or its Equity Shares in the Buyback shall be deemed to have

6.13 Intention of promoter and promoter group to participate in Buyback: 
6.13.1 In terms of the Buyback Regulations, under the tender offer route, the Promoter and Promoter Group have the option 
to participate in the Buyback. In this regard, the Promoter and Promoter Group of the Company have expressed their 
intention of not participa ting in the Buyback vide their letters dated September 14, 2025, September 16, 2025, 
September 17, 2025, September 18, 2025, and September 19, 2025.  
6.13.2 The date and price of the acquisition and other details of the Equity Shares held by the promoter and promoter group 
who are intending to tender their shares: Not applicable.  
6.14 Pursuant to the proposed Buyback and depending on the response to the Buyback, the voting rights of the Promoters and 
Promoter Group in the Company which constitutes 13.05% as on date of the Public Announcement, may change. We confirm 
that after the completion of the Buyback, the public shareholding of the Company shall not fall below the minimum level 
required as per Regulation 38 of the LODR Regulations. Any such change in the voting rights of the Promoters and Promoter 
Group post conclusion of buyback will not result in any change in control over the Company. 
7. AUTHORITY FOR THE BUYBACK 
7.1 This Buyback is being undertaken in accordance with Article 14 of the Articles of Association of the Company, Sections 68, 
69, 70 and other applicable provisions, if any, of the Act, the relevant rules framed thereunder, including the Share Capital  
Rules, and the Management Rules, to the extent applicable, and the Buyback Regulations.  
7.2 Given the Company’s class of securities registered under Section 12 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, 
and the shareholding of U.S. residents by way of ADSs and Equity Shares, it was necessary for the Company to seek and obtain 
exemptive relief from the SEC on certain aspects of the tender offer procedures, due to conflicting regulatory requirements 
between Indian and U.S. laws for tender offer buybacks, and the same has been obtained post the Board’s approval for the 
Buyback. 
7.3 This Buyback is further subject to approvals, permissions and sanctions as may be necessary, from time to time from statutory, 
regulatory or governmental authorities as required under applicable laws, including but not limited from RBI, SEBI and /or the 
Indian Stock Exchanges. 
7.4 The Board at its meeting dated September 11, 2025 passed a resolution approving the Buyback of Equity Shares of the Company 
and sought approval of its Shareholders, by a special resolution, through a Postal Ballot Notice dated September 25, 2025. The 
Shareholders of the Company have approved the Buyback by way of a special resolution, through the postal ballot concluded 
on November 4, 2025. 
8. NECESSITY / OBJECTIVE OF THE BUYBACK 
8.1 The Buyback is being undertaken by the Company after taking into account the strategic and operational cash needs in the 
medium term and the need for returning surplus funds to the members in an effective and efficient manner in line with its capital 
allocation policy. The financial parameters / internal factors that shall be considered include, but are not limited to:  
• Expected cash requirements of the Company towards working capital, investments in AI and other areas, capital 
expenditure in technology and infrastructure etc.; 
• Investments required towards execution of the Company’s strategy; 
• Funds required for any acquisitions that the Board may approve; 
• Minimum cash required for contingencies or unforeseen events; 
• Any other significant developments that require cash investments 
8.2 The expected cash generation and strong balance sheet position of the Company allows it to reward its members, while retaining 
sufficient capital for business requirements. Since 2017, the Company has undertaken multiple buybacks, which, along with 
 
 
28 
 
regular and special dividends has enabled the Company to distribute the surplus cash to shareholders in a predictable and 
efficient manner. 
8.3 As of June 30, 2025, the Company had consolidated cash and investments (comprising of cash and cash equivalents, current 
and non- current investments excluding investments in equity and preference shares and others) of ₹ 45,204 crore.  
8.4 The Buyback is being undertaken for the following reasons: 
• The Buyback will help the Company to return surplus cash to its members, in line with the stated Capital Allocation 
Policy; 
• The Buyback is expected to improve return on equity through distribution of cash and improve earnings per share by 
reduction in the equity base in the long term, thereby leading to long term increase in members’ value;  
• The Buyback gives an option to all the members of the Company as on the Record Date, either to sell their Equity 
Shares and receive cash or not to sell their Equity Shares and get a resultant increase in their percentage shareholding 
in the Company post the Buyback, without additional investment; and 
• The Buyback, which is being implemented through the Tender Offer route would involve allocating to the Small 
Shareholders the higher of: (a) the number of shares entitled as per their shareholding; or (b) 15% of the number of 
shares to be bought back, as per Regulation 6 of the Buyback Regulations. The Company believes that this reservation 
for small shareholders would benefit a large number of the Company’s public shareholders, who would be classified 
as “Small Shareholders”. 
8.5 As per the stated Capital Allocation Policy, “ Effective from financial year 2025, the Company expects to continue its policy of 
returning approximately 85% of the free cash flow cumulatively over a 5- year period through a combination of semi -annual 
dividends and/or share buyback/ special dividends, subject to applicable laws and requisite approvals, if any”. Under this policy, 
the Company expects to progressively increase its annual Dividend Per Share (excluding special dividend if any). In line with 
the above Capital Allocation Policy, the Buyback is expected to create long term value for the shareholders with a reduction in 
the equity base. 
9. MAXIMUM NUMBER OF EQUITY SHARES THAT THE COMPANY PROPOSES TO BUYBACK  
9.1 The indicative number of Equity Shares at the Buyback Price and the Buyback Offer Size bought back would be 10,00,00,000 
(Ten crore) Equity Shares, comprising approximately 2.41% of the total paid-up equity share capital of the Company as of June 
30, 2025 (on a standalone basis). 
10. MAXIMUM AMOUNT REQUIRED UNDER THE BUYBACK 
10.1 The amount of funds required for the Buyback will aggregate to ₹ 18,000 crore (Rupees Eighteen Thousand Crore only), being 
24.31% and 21.68% of the aggregate of the total paid- up share capital and free reserves of the Company on a standalone and 
consolidated basis, respectively, which is less than 25% of the aggregate of the total paid- up share capital and free reserves of 
the Company based on the latest audited interim condensed financial statements of the Company as at June 30, 2025 on a 
standalone basis and consolidated basis. 
10.2 The Buyback Offer Size does not include any expenses or transaction costs incurred or to be incurred for the Buyback, such as, 
brokerage, filing fees, advisory fees, intermediaries’ fees, public announcement publication expenses, printing and dispatch 
expenses, applicable taxes such as securities transaction tax, goods and services tax, stamp duty etc. and other incidental and 
related expenses. 
10.3 The funds for the implementation of the proposed Buyback will be sourced out of the free reserves and securities premium 
account of the Company or such other source as may be permitted by the Buyback Regulations or the Act. Borrowed funds from 
banks and financial institutions, if any, will not be used for the Buyback. 
11. MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF THE LIKELY IMPACT OF THE BUYBACK ON THE 
 
 
29 
 
COMPANY 
11.1 The Company believes that the Buyback is not likely to cause any material impact on the profitability or earnings of the Company 
except to the extent of reduction in the amount available for investment, which the Company could have otherwise deployed 
towards generating investment income until eventual distribution to shareholders as per the Capital Allocation Policy. Assuming 
full response to the Buyback, the funds deployed by the Company towards the Buyback would be up to ₹ 18,000 Crore (Rupees 
Eighteen Thousand Crore only), excluding Transaction Costs. This shall impact the investment income earned by the Company, 
on account of the reduced amount of funds available for investments. 
11.2 In terms of the SEBI Buyback Regulations, under the Tender Offer route, the Promoter and Promoter Group have an option to 
participate in the Buyback. In this regard, the Promoter and Promoter group have expressed their intention to not participate  in 
the Buyback vide their letters dated September 14, 2025, September 16, 2025, September 17, 2025, September 18, 2025 and 
September 19, 2025. Assuming participation in the Buyback is to the extent of 100% (full acceptance) from all the other Eligible 
Shareholders up to their Buyback Entitlement, the aggregate shareholding of the Promoters and members of the Promoter Group 
after the completion of the Buyback shall increase to 13.37% of the post - Buyback total paid- up Equity Share capital of the 
Company from 13.05% of the pre -Buyback total paid -up Equity Share capital of the Company (as on the date of the Public 
Announcement), and the aggregate shareholding of the public in the Company shall change to 86.63% of the post - Buyback 
total paid-up Equity Share capital of the Company from 86.95 % of the pre- Buyback total paid-up Equity Share capital of the 
Company.  
11.3 The Buyback is not expected to result in a change in control or otherwise affect the existing management structure of the 
Company. 
11.4 Consequent to the Buyback and based on the number of Equity Shares bought back from the Non-Resident Shareholders, Indian 
financial institutions, banks, mutual funds and the public including other bodies corporate, the shareholding of each such person 
shall undergo a change.  The FIIs/FPIs are advised to ensure that their investment in the Company continues to be within the 
limit prescribed under applicable laws, post completion of the Buyback.  
11.5 The Company believes that the Buyback will not impact the growth opportunities of the Company.  
11.6 The Buyback is expected to improve return on equity through distribution of cash and improve earnings per share by reduction 
in the equity base in the long term, thereby leading to long term increase in members’ value . 
11.7 As on the date of this Letter of Offer, the Company does not have any outstanding debt from lenders. Accordingly, the Company 
confirms that the ratio of the aggregate of secured and unsecured debts owed by the Company is not and shall not be more than 
twice the paid -up share capital and free reserves based on lower of the audited interim condensed standalone or consoli dated 
financial statements of the Company as on June 30, 2025.  
11.8 The Company shall not raise further capital for a period of 1 (one) year from the expiry of the Buyback Period except in discharge 
of its subsisting obligations. 
11.9 Subject to applicable law, the Company shall not issue any Equity Shares or other specified securities including by way of bonus 
issue till the expiry of the Buyback Period, except in discharge of subsisting obligations through conversion of stock option  
schemes into equity shares. As on the date of the Public Announcement, 5,24,185 RSUs are vested, which may get converted 
to Equity Shares during the Buyback Period. 
11.10 There are no defaults subsisting in the repayment of deposits or interest payment thereon, redemption of debentures or intere st 
payment thereon or payment of dividend due to any shareholder, or repayment of any term loans or interest payable thereon to 
any financial institution or banking company, in the last three years.  
11.11 The Company is not undertaking the Buyback so as to delist its shares from the Indian Stock Exchanges.

12.1 The Equity Shares of the Company are proposed to be bought back at a price of ₹ 1,800/- (Rupees One Thousand Eight Hundred 
only) per Equity Share (“Buyback Price”). The Buyback Price has been arrived at after considering various factors including, 
but not limited to, the trends in the volume weighted average market prices of the Equity Shares on BSE and NSE where the 
Equity Shares are listed, price earnings ratio,  impact on other financial parameters and the possible impact of the Buyback on 
the earnings per Equity Share. Further, in accordance with Regulation 5(via) of the Buyback Regulations, the Board/Buyback 
Committee may increase the Buyback Price and decrease the number of Equity Shares proposed to be bought back provided 
that there is no change in the Buyback Offer Size, till one working day prior to the Record Date fixed for the purpose of Buyback. 
In line with the recent market practice in relation to buybacks, the Buyback Price represents:  
• Premium of 15.60% and 16.99% to the volume weighted average market price of the Equity Shares on BSE and NSE, 
respectively, during the three months period ending September 8, 2025, being the date of the intimation to the stock exchanges

respectively, during the two weeks period ending September 8, 2025, being the date of the intimation to the stock exchanges 
regarding the proposal of buyback being considered at Board Meeting. 
• Premium of 25.64% and 25.62% over the closing price of the Equity Shares on BSE as well as NSE, respectively, as on 
September 8, 2025, being the date of intimation to the stock exchanges regarding the proposal of buyback being considered 
at Board Meeting. 
13. SOURCES OF FUNDS FOR THE BUYBACK

17. BRIEF INFORMATION OF THE COMPANY  
17.1 History and Overview of the Company 
17.1.1 Infosys is a global leader in next generation digital services and consulting.  
17.1.2 The Company was incorporated on July 2, 1981, in Maharashtra, India, as “Infosys Consultants Private Limited”, 
a private limited company under the Indian Companies Act, 1956. The Company’s name was changed to “Infosys 
Technologies Private Limited” in April 1992 and to “Infosys Technologies Limited” i n June 1992, when the 
Company became a public limited company. In June 2011, the Company changed its name from “Infosys 
Technologies Limited” to “Infosys Limited”, following approval of the name change by the Board, shareholders 
and the Indian regulatory authorities. The registered office of the Company is at Electronics City, Hosur Road, 
Bengaluru 560 100, India. The name change was intended to reflect the transition from a provider of technology 
services to a business transformation partner to its clients. The Company made an initial public offering of equity 
shares in India in February 1993, which were listed on the stock exchanges in India  in June 1993. The Company 
completed the initial public offering of ADSs in the United States in 1999. In 2003, 2005 and 2006, the Company 
completed sponsored secondary offerings of ADSs in the United States on behalf of the shareholders. Each of the 
2005 and 2006 sponsored secondary offerings also included a public offering w ithout listing (POWL) in Japan. 
In 2008, the Company was selected as an original component member of 'The Global Dow', a world- wide stock 
index made up of 150 leading blue -chip stocks. Following the voluntary delisting from the NASDAQ Global 
Select Market on December 11, 2012, the Company began trading of its ADSs on the NYSE on December 12, 
2012, under the ticker symbol INFY. On February 20, 2013, the Company also listed its ADSs on the Euronext 
Paris and Euronext London markets, under the ticker symbol IN FY. Infosys voluntarily delisted its ADSs from 
Euronext Paris and London on July 5, 2018. The primary reason for voluntary delisting from Euronext Paris and 
London was the low average daily trading volume of Infosys ADSs on these exchanges, which was not 
commensurate with the related administrative expenses. Infosys ADSs continue to be listed on the NYSE under 
the symbol “INFY” and investors continue to trade their ADSs on the NYSE.

20. DETAILS OF STATUTORY APPROVALS  
20.1 The Board, at its meeting held on September 11, 2025, approved the proposal for the Buyback. The shareholders of the 
Company approved the Buyback, by way of a special resolution, through a postal ballot by remote e- voting, the results of 
which were announced on November 6, 2025.  
20.2 The Buyback Offer is subject to approval, if any required, under the provisions of the Act, the Buyback Regulations and/or 
such other applicable rules and regulations in force for the time being. 
20.3 The Buyback from each Eligible Shareholder is subject to all statutory consents and approvals as may be required by such 
Eligible Shareholder under applicable laws and regulations. The relevant Eligible Shareholder shall be solely responsible for 
obtaining all such statutory consents and approvals (including, without limitation the approvals from the RBI and/or SEBI, 
if any) as may be required by them in order to tender their Equity Shares to the Company pursuant to the Buyback. An 
Eligible Shareholder would be required to provide copies of all such consents and approvals obtained by them to the Registrar 
to the Buyback.  
20.4 The Buyback of Equity Shares from Non- Resident Shareholders will be subject to approvals, if any, of the appropriate 
authorities, including Reserve Bank of India (RBI), as may be required. Non-Resident Shareholders must obtain all approvals 
if required to tender their Equity Shares held by them in this Buyback (including without limitation, approval from the RBI). 
It is the obligation of such Non- Resident Shareholders, to obtain such approvals (if required) and submit such approvals 
along with the Tender Form, so as to enable them to tender Equity Shares in the Buyback and for the Company to purchase 
such Equity Shares tendered. The Company will have the right to make payment to the Eligible Shareholders in respect of 
whom no prior RBI approval is required and not accept Equity Shares from the Eligible Shareholders in respect of whom

Shareholder; and (b) undertakes to provide the requisite assistance to the Company for making any such regulatory /statutory 
filings and compliances. 
20.7 Given the Company’s class of securities registered under Section 12 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended, and the shareholding of U.S. residents by way of ADSs and Equity Shares, it was necessary for the Company to 
seek and obtain exemptive relief from the SEC on certain aspects of the tender offer procedures, due to conflicting regulatory 
requirements between Indian and U.S. laws for tender offer buybacks, and the same has been obtained post the Board’s 
approval for the Buyback.

Offer, other than that indicated above. If any statutory or regulatory approval becomes applicable subsequently, the Buyback

approvals, changes to the proposed timetable of the Buyback Offer, if any, shall be intimated to the Indian Stock Exchanges.

erstwhile overseas corporate bodies), foreign portfolio investors, non- resident Indians, members of foreign nationality, if 
any, shall be subject to the FEMA and rules and regulations framed thereunder, if any, Income Tax Act, 1961 and rules and 
regulations framed thereunder, as applicable, and also subject to the receipt/provision by such Eligible Shareholders of such 
approvals, if and to the extent necessary or required from concerned authorities including, but not limited to, approvals from 
the RBI under the FEMA and rules and regulations framed thereunder, if any.

guidelines, for remittance of funds, shall be made by the Eligible Shareholders and/or the shareholder’s broker through which 
the Eligible Shareholder places the bid.

Clearing Corporations and a valid bid in the exchange bidding system, the bid by such Eligible Shareholder shall be deemed

consent of its lenders for breach of any covenant with such lenders

22. PROCESS AND METHODOLOGY FOR THE BUYBACK 
22.1 The Company proposes to buyback Equity Shares for an amount of ₹ 18,000 crore (Rupees Eighteen Thousand Crore only) 
at a price of ₹1,800/- (Rupees One Thousand Eight Hundred only) per Equity Share payable in cash, comprising of a purchase 
of 10,00,00,000 (Ten Crore) Equity Shares aggregating up to 2.41% of the fully paid-up equity share capital of the Company 
 
49 
 
(on a standalone basis), from the Eligible Shareholders on a proportionate basis through a Tender Offer, pursuant to Article 
14 of the Articles of Association of the Company, Sections 68, 69 and 70 and other applicable provisions, if any, of the Act, 
the relevant rules framed thereunder including the Share Capital Rules, to the extent applicable, and the Buyback Regulations. 
The Buy-back Size represents 24.31% and 21.68% of the aggregate of the total paid-up share capital and free reserves of the 
Company ba sed on the latest audited interim condensed financial statements of the Company as at June 30, 2025 on a 
standalone basis and consolidated basis, respectively. The Equity Shareholders approved the Buyback by way of a special 
resolution through postal ballot, the results of which were announced on November 6, 2025. This Buyback is further subject 
to approvals, permissions and sanctions as may be necessary, from time to time from statutory, regulatory or governmental 
authorities as required under applicable laws, including but not limited from RBI, SEBI and/or the Indian Stock Exchanges  
22.2 The Buyback is open to all Eligible Shareholders (including ADS holders who submitted their desired number of ADSs to 
the Depositary and withdrew the underlying Equity Shares such that they are holding Equity Shares as of the Record Date) 
and beneﬁcial owners of the Company holding Equity Shares either in physical or electronic form, as on the Record Date.  
22.3 The Company expresses no opinion as to whether Eligible Shareholders should participate in the Buyback and, accordingly, 
Eligible Shareholders are advised to consult their own advisors to consider participation in the Buyback.  
22.4 The aggregate shareholding of the Promoters and Promoter Group as at the date of the Public Announcement and this Letter 
of Offer is 54,20,29,249 Equity Shares which represents 13.05% of the existing equity share capital of the Company. In terms 
of the SEB I Buyback Regulations, under the Tender Offer route, the Promoter and Promoter Group have an option to 
participate in the Buyback. In this regard, the Promoter and Promoter group have expressed their intention to not participate  
in the Buyback vide their letters dated September 14, 2025, September 16, 2025, September 17, 2025, September 18, 2025,  
and September 19, 2025. 
22.5 Assuming participation in the Buyback is to the extent of 100% (full acceptance) from all the other Eligible Shareholders up 
to their Buyback Entitlement, the aggregate shareholding of the Promoters and m embers of the Promoter Group after the 
completion of the Buyback shall increase to 13.37% of the post- Buyback total paid-up Equity Share capital of the Company 
from 13.05% of the pre -Buyback total paid -up Equity Share capital of the Company (as on the date of the Public 
Announcement) 
Record Date and Ratio of Buyback as per the Buyback Entitlement in each Category:  
22.6 The Company has fixed November 14, 2025,  as the Record Date for the purpose of determining the Buyback Entitlement 
and the names of the Equity Shareholders, who are eligible to participate in the Buyback.  
22.7 The Equity Shares to be bought back pursuant to the Buyback are divided into 2 (two) categories:  
22.7.1 Reserved category for Small Shareholders (“Reserved Category”); and 
22.7.2 General category for all other Eligible Shareholders (“General Category”). 
22.8 As defined in the Buyback Regulations, a “Small Shareholder” is an Eligible Shareholder who holds Equity Shares having 
market value, on the basis of closing price on BSE or NSE, on which the highest trading volume in respect of the Equity 
Shares on the Record Date was recorded, of not more than ₹2,00,000 (Rupees Two Lakh only). As on the Record Date, the 
closing price on NSE, the stock exchange having the highest trading volume, was ₹
 1,502.80 per Equity Share. Accordingly, 
all Eligible Shareholders holding not more than 133 Equity Shares as on the Record Date are classified as ‘Small 
Shareholders’ for the purpose of the Buyback.  
22.9 Based on the aforementioned definition, there are 25,85,684 Small Shareholders of the Company with an aggregate 
shareholding of 8,25,4 3,948 Equity Shares as on the Record Date, which constitutes 1.99 % of the outstanding number of 
equity shares of the Company and 82.54% of the maximum number of Equity Shares which are proposed to be bought back 
as part of this Buyback. 
22.10 In accordance with Regulation 6 of the Buyback Regulations, the reservation for the Small Shareholders will be the higher 
of: 
22.10.1 Fifteen percent ( 15%) of the number of Equity Shares which the Company proposes to buy back i.e. 15% of 
10,00,00,000 (Ten crore) Equity Shares which is 1,50,00,000 Equity Shares; or 
22.10.2 The number of Equity Shares entitled as per their shareholding as on the Record Date (i.e. ( 8,25,43,948 / 
361,23,72,100) x 10,00,00,000) which is 22,85,034 Equity Shares.  
22.11 Since the Promoters and Promoter Group of the Company have declared their intention to not participate in the Buyback, 
Equity Shares held by them have not been considered for the purposes of computing the entitlement ratio. 
22.12 Based on the above analysis and in accordance with Regulation 6 of the Buyback Regulations, 1,50,00,000 Equity Shares 
have been reserved for the Small Shareholders (“Reserved Portion ”) and accordingly, the General Category for all other 
 
50 
 
Eligible Shareholders shall consist of 8,50,00,000 Equity Shares (“General Portion”). 
22.13 Based on the above Buyback Entitlements, the ratio of Buyback for both categories is set out below:  
Category of Eligible Shareholder Ratio of Buyback 
(i.e. Buyback Entitlement) 
Reserved category for Small Shareholders 2 Equity Shares for every 11 Equity Share held on the Record 
Date  
General category for all other Eligible 
Shareholders 
17 Equity Shares for every 706 Equity Share held on the Record 
Date  
Note: The above ratio of Buyback is approximate and provides indicative Buyback Entitlement. Any computation of 
the Buyback Entitlement using the above Buyback ratio may provide a slightly different number than the actual 
entitlement due to rounding -off. The actual Buyback Entitlement factor for Small Shareholders under the Reserved 
Category is 18.17213782892960 % and for other shareholders under the General Category is 2.40804924035293%. 
Also, the numbers arrived at using the actual Buyback Entitlement may not conform exactly to the Buyback Entitlement 
printed in the Tender Form due to rounding-off of the factor. 
Fractional Entitlements 
22.14 If the Buyback Entitlement under the Buyback, after applying the abovementioned ratios to the Equity Shares held on Record 
Date is not in the multiple of 1 (one) Equity Share, then the fractional entitlement shall be ignored for computation of Buyback 
Entitlement to tender Equity Shares in the Buyback for both categories of Eligible Shareholders.  
22.15 On account of ignoring the fractional entitlement, those Small Shareholders who hold 5 or less Equity Shares as on Record 
Date will be dispatched a Tender Form with zero entitlement. Such Small Shareholders may tender Additional Equity Shares 
as part of the Buyback and will be given preference in the Acceptance of one Equity Share, if such Small Shareholders have 
tendered Additional Equity Shares. The Company shall make best efforts subject to Buyback Regulations in accepting Equity 
Shares tendered by such Eligible Shareholders to the extent possible and permissible.  
Basis of Acceptance of Equity Shares validly tendered in the Reserved Category for Small Shareholders   
22.16 Subject to the provisions contained in this Letter of Offer, the Company will accept the Equity Shares tendered in the Buyback 
by the Small Shareholders in the Reserved Category in the following order of priority:  
22.16.1 Acceptance of 100% Equity Shares from Small Shareholders in the Reserved Category, who have validly tendered 
their Equity Shares to the extent of their Buyback Entitlement or the number of Equity Shares tendered by them, 
whichever is less. 
22.16.2 After the Acceptance as described in Paragraph 22.16.1 above, in case there are any Equity Shares left to be bought 
back from Small Shareholders in the Reserved Category, the Small Shareholders who were entitled to tender zero 
Equity Shares (on account of fractional entitlement), and have tendered Additional Equity Shares as part of the 
Buyback, shall be given preference and one Equity Share each from such Additional Equity Shares shall be bought 
back in the Reserved Category. 
22.16.3 After the Acceptance as described in Paragraph 22.16.1 and 22.16.2 above, in case there are any Equity Shares left 
to be bought back in the Reserved Category, the Additional Equity Shares tendered by the Small Shareholders over 
and above their Buyback Entitlement, shall be accepted in proportion of the Additional Equity Shares tendered by 
them and the Acceptance per Small Shareholder shall be made in accordance with the Buyback Regulations. Valid 
Acceptances per Small Shareholder shall be equal to the Additional Equity Shares validly tendered by the Small 
Shareholder divided by the total Additional Equity Shares validly tendered and multiplied by the total pending 
number of Equity Shares to be accepted in Reserved Category. For the purpose of this calculation, the Additional 
Equity Shares taken into account for such Small Shareholders, from whom one Equity Share has been Accepted in 
accordance with the Paragraph 22.16.2, shall be reduced by one. 
Adjustment for fractional results in case of proportionate Acceptance, as described above: 
22.17 For any Small Shareholder, if the number of Additional Equity Shares to be Accepted, calculated on a proportionate basis is 
not a multiple of one and the fractional Acceptance is greater than or equal to 0.50, then the fraction would be rounded off 
to the next higher integer. 
22.18 For any Small Shareholder, if the number of Additional Equity Shares to be Accepted, calculated on a proportionate basis is 
not in the multiple of one and the fractional Acceptance is less than 0.50, then the fraction shall be ignored.  
Basis of Acceptance of Equity Shares validly tendered in the General Category  
 
51 
 
22.19 Subject to the provisions contained in this Letter of Offer, the Company will accept the Equity Shares tendered in the Buyback 
by all other Eligible Shareholders in the General Category in the following order of priority:  
22.19.1 Acceptance of 100% Equity Shares from other Eligible Shareholders in the General Category who have validly 
tendered their Equity Shares, to the extent of their Buyback Entitlement, or the number of Equity Shares tendered 
by them, whichever is less. 
22.19.2 After the Acceptance as described in Paragraph 22.19.1 above, in case there are any Equity Shares left to be bought 
back in the General Category, the Additional Equity Shares tendered by the other Eligible Shareholders over and 
above their Buyback Entitlement shall be Accepted in proportion of the Additional Equity Shares tendered by them 
and the acceptances per shareholder shall be made in accordance with the Buyback Regulations, i.e. valid 
acceptances per shareholder shall be equal to the Additional Equit y Shares validly tendered by the Eligible 
Shareholders divided by the total Additional Equity Shares validly tendered in the General Category and multiplied 
by the total pending number of Equity Shares to be Accepted in General Category.  
Adjustment for fractional results in case of proportionate acceptance as described above:  
22.20 For any Eligible Shareholder, if the number of Additional Equity Shares to be Accepted, calculated on a proportionate basis 
is not in the multiple of one and the fractional Acceptance is greater than or equal to 0.50, then the fraction would be rounded 
off to the next higher integer. For any Eligible Shareholder, if the number of Additional Equity Shares to be Accepted, 
calculated on a proportionate basis is not in the multiple of one and the fractional Acceptance is less than 0.50, then the 
fraction shall be ignored. 
Basis of Acceptance of Equity Shares between categories 
22.21 In case there are any Equity Shares left to be bought back in one category (“ Partially Filled Category”) after Acceptance 
in accordance with the above described methodology for both the categories, and there are additional unaccepted validly 
tendered Equity Shares in the second category (“ Over Tendered Category”), then the further Additional Equity Shares in 
the Over Tendered Category shall be Accepted proportionately (i.e., valid Acceptances per Eligible Shareholder shall be 
equal to the additional outstanding Equity Shares validly tendered by an Eligible Shareholder in the Over Tendered Category 
divided by the total additional outstanding Equity Shares validly tendered in the Over Tendered Category and multiplied by 
the total pending number of Equity Shares to be bought back in the Partially Filled Category). 
22.22 If the Partially Filled Category is the General Category, and the Over Tendered Category is the Reserved Category for Small 
Shareholders, then any Small Shareholder, for the purpose of this calculation, the Additional Equity Shares tendered by such 
Small Shareholders, from whom one Equity Share has been Accepted in accordance with paragraph 22.21 shall be reduced 
by one Equity Share.  
22.23 Adjustment for fraction results in case of proportionate Acceptance, as described in paragraph 22.21 above: 
22.23.1 For any Eligible Shareholder, if the number of Additional Equity Shares to be Accepted, calculated on a 
proportionate basis is not in the multiple of one and the fractional Acceptance is greater than or equal to 0.50 
(zero point five), then the fraction would be rounded off to the next higher integer.  
22.23.2 For any Eligible Shareholder, if the number of Additional Equity Shares to be Accepted, calculated on a 
proportionate basis is not in the multiple of one and the fractional Acceptance is less than 0.50 (zero point five), 
then the fraction shall be ignored. 
Clubbing of Entitlement 
22.24 In order to ensure that the same Eligible Shareholder(s) with multiple demat accounts/folios do not receive a higher 
entitlement under the Small Shareholder category, the Company will club together the Equity Shares held by such 
shareholders with a common PAN for determining the category (Small Shareholder or General) and entitlement under the 
Buyback. In case of joint shareholding, the Company will club together the Equity Shares held in cases where the sequence 
of the PANs of the joint shareholders is identical and where the PANs of all joint shareholders are not available, the Registrar 
will check the sequence of the names of the joint holders and club together the Equity Shares held in such cases where the 
name of joint shareholders are identical. In case of physical shareholders, where the sequence of PANs is identical and where 
the PANs of all joint shareholders are not available, the Registrar to the Buyback will check the sequence of the names of 
the joint holders and club together the Equity Shares held in such cases where the sequence of the PANs and name of joint 
shareholders are identical. The shareholding of institutional investors like mutual funds, pension funds/trusts and insurance  
companies etc., with common PAN will not be clubbed together for determining the category and will be considered 
separately, where these Equity Shares are held for different schemes and have a different demat account nomenclature based 
on information prepared by the Registrar and Transfer Agent as per the shareholder records received from the Depositories. 
Further, the Equity Shares held under the category of “clearing members” or “corporate body margin account” or “corporate 
 
52 
 
body –broker” as per the beneficial position data as on the Record Date, with common PAN, are not proposed to be clubbed 
together for determining their entitlement and will be considered separately, where these Equity Shares are assumed to be 
held on behalf of clients. 
Miscellaneous 
22.25 For avoidance of doubt, it is clarified that: 
22.25.1 The Eligible Shareholders are advised to tender Equity Shares from their respective demat accounts/ folios in which 
they are holding the Equity Shares as on the Record Date; 
22.25.2 The Equity Shares accepted under the Buyback from each Eligible Shareholder, in accordance with the paragraphs 
above, shall not exceed the number of Equity Shares tendered by the respective Eligible Shareholders;  
22.25.3 The Equity Shares accepted under the Buyback from each Eligible Shareholder, in accordance with the paragraphs 
above, shall not exceed the number of Equity Shares held by respective Eligible Shareholder as on the Record Date; 
and 
22.25.4 The Equity Shares tendered by any Eligible Shareholder over and above the number of Equity Shares held by such 
Eligible Shareholder as on the Record Date shall not be considered for the purpose of acceptance in accordance with 
the paragraphs above. 
22.25.5 In case of any practical issues, resulting out of rounding -off of Equity Shares or otherwise, the Board or Buyback 
Committee authorized by the Board will have the authority to decide such final allocation with respect to such 
rounding-off or any excess of Equity Shares or any shortage of Equity Shares after allocation of Equity Shares as 
set out in the process described this Section 22. 
Participation by ADS Holders  
22.26 ADS holders will not be eligible to tender ADSs in the Buyback. As intimated by the Company in the Postal Ballot Notice 
dated September 25, 2025 (refer to section (12) of the explanatory statement attached to the Postal Ballot Notice –Additional 
Information for Holders of the Company’s American Depositary Shares), in order for ADS holders to participate in the 
Buyback, they must have previously taken certain actions in order to withdraw the Equity Shares underlying the ADSs held 
by them in advance of the Record Date and should have become holders of Equity Shares on the Record Date. They, therefore, 
needed to (i) apply for and obtain a PAN from the Indian Income Tax Department to allow them to directly hold Equity 
Shares, (ii) establish an account with a bank, broker or other nominee in India sufficiently in advance of the Record Date to 
receive Equity Shares in electronic/ dematerialized form and set up a broker account in India to effect the transactions in the 
Equity Shares (an “Indian Demat account (Subty pe DR) and a Brokerage Account ”) prior to the Record Date, and (iii) 
submit their desired number of ADSs to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as ADR 
depositary (the “Depositary”) 
for cancellation along with proper cancellation instructions in each case sufficiently in advance of the Record Date and 
withdraw the underlying Equity Shares such that they are holding Equity Shares of the Company as of the Record Date. As 
a holder of Equity Shares as of the Record Date, they can tender into the Buyback any or  all such withdrawn Equity Shares 
in accordance with the terms of the Buyback when the Tendering Period for the Buyback commences.  
22.27 ADS holders who cancelled any ADSs and withdrew the underlying Equity Shares, such that they became holders of Equity 
Shares as of the Record Date will be allocated an entitlement that is dependent on the number of Equity Shares held as of the 
Record Date. 
22.28 Equity Shares trade on the NSE and the BSE and cannot be traded on the NYSE. There is no guarantee that any ADS holder 
who submitted ADSs for cancellation and withdrawal of the underlying Equity Shares will have any or all of such Equity 
Shares accepted in the Buyback. The Company had received an intimation from the SEBI in 2017 that the Depository Receipt 
Scheme, 2014 issued by the Government of India was presently in vogue. Since  the Depository Receipt Scheme, 2014 has 
not been amended with respect to conversion or reconversion of the depository receipts, the same advice holds true. In terms 
of the scheme, the conversion of ADSs into Equity Shares and vice versa is available to the Company. Accordingly, the re -
deposit of the withdrawn Equity Shares against  the creation of ADS will be in accordance with the provisions of the 
Depository Scheme, 2014 and the terms of the ADSs. 
22.29 If an ADS holder withdrew Equity Shares underlying his or her ADSs after the ADS postal ballot cut -off date and prior to 
the last date of the Tendering Period, such ADS holder will be able to re -deposit against the creation of ADSs any of such 
Equity Shares that are not tendered in the Buyback, or if tendered, are not accepted in the Buyback, and receive in return 
ADSs representing such re -deposited Equity Shares if such ADS holder has such Equity Shares delivered to the Custodian 
for the Depositary (along with ADS issuance instructions) on or prior to 30 days after expiration of the Tendering Period. 
The Depositary has agreed to waive the ADS issuance fee that would otherwise be payable in connection with the issuance 
 
53 
 
of ADSs representing such re-deposited Equity Shares during such 30-day period. 
22.30 Withdrawn Equity Shares for which the aforementioned re -deposit does not occur and / or instruction is not given within 
such 30-day period, as well as Equity Shares withdrawn prior to the ADS postal ballot cut-off date or after the last day of the 
Tendering Period, may only be re -deposited against the creation of ADSs to the extent a specified maximum number of 
outstanding ADSs would not be exceeded. Accordingly, the Company cannot assure ADS holders that such Equity Shares 
will be able to be re-deposited against the creation of ADSs. In addition, in these circumstances, the ADS issuance fee would 
not be waived with respect to the issuance of ADSs representing such Equity Shares.  
23. PROCEDURE FOR TENDER / OFFER AND SETTLEMENT  
23.1 The Buyback is open to all Eligible Shareholders who hold Equity Shares either in physical form or dematerialized form as

of the Buyback Re gulations, the Company shall not buyback locked- in Equity Shares and non- transferable Equity Shares

till such time BSE/NSE shall display such bids as ‘unconfirm ed physical bids’. Once the Registrar to the Buyback 
confirms the bids it will be treated as ‘Confirmed Bids’. 
23.26.5 In case any Eligible Shareholder has submitted Equity Shares in physical form for dematerialization, such Equity 
Shareholders should ensure that the process of getting the Equity Shares  dematerialized is completed well in time 
so that they can participate in the Buyback before Buyback Window Closing Date.

58 
 
should obtain and enclose a letter from its authorised dealer / bank confirming that at the time of acquiring such 
Equity Shares, payment for the same was made by such Eligible Shareholder, from the appropriate account as 
specified by RBI in its approval. In case the Eligible Shareholder, being a Non-  Resident Shareholder, is not in a 
position to produce the said certificate, the Equity Shares would be deemed to have been acquired on non-
repatriation basis, and in that case, the Eligible Shareholder shall submit a consent letter addressed to the Company, 
allowing the Company to make the payment on a non- repatriation basis in respect of the valid Equity Shares 
accepted under the Buyback.

the said certificate, the Equity Shares would be deemed to have been acquired on non-repatriation basis and in that 
case the Non -Resident Eligible Shareholder shall submit a consent letter addressed to the Company allowing the 
Company to make the payment on a non-repatriation basis in respect of the valid Equity Shares Accepted under the

transfer to such Eligible Shareholder holding Equity Shares in dematerialized form.  
23.28.3 In case of certain client types viz. NRI, foreign clients etc. (where there are specific RBI and other regulatory

from the date of its issuance, within which the Equity Shareholder shall be required to make a request to 
their depository participant for dematerializing the physical Equity Shares. In case the Equity Shareholder 
fails to submit the demat request within the aforementioned period, the RTA shall credit the physical Equity 
Shares to a separate demat account of the Company opened for the said purpose. The lien marked against 
unaccepted Equity Shares will be released, if any, or would be returned by registered post or by ordinary post or 
courier (in case of physical shares) at the Eligible Shareholders’ sole risk. Eligible Shareholders should ensure that

24. NOTE ON TAXATION  
Set forth below are certain tax considerations related to tendering Equity Shares the Company in the Buyback. The 
Buyback, together with certain tax considerations related to the withdrawal of Equity Shares underlying ADSs and the re -
deposit of Equity Shares not tendered or not accepted in the Buyback against the creation of ADSs, is described in the Postal 
Ballot Notice, which has been furnished with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 6 -K. 
A. INDIAN TAXATION 
 
THE SUMMARY OF THE INCOME -TAX CONSIDERATIONS IN THIS SECTION ARE BASED ON THE 
CURRENT PROVISIONS OF THE INCOME TAX ACT, 1961  AND THE REGULATIONS THEREUNDER, THE 
JUDICIAL AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE INTERPRETATIONS THEREOF, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO 
CHANGE OR MODIFICATION BY SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY, ADMINISTRATIVE OR 
JUDICIAL DECISIONS. ANY SUCH CHANGES COULD HAVE DIFFERENT INCOME TAX IMPLICATIONS. 
 
IN VIEW OF THE PARTICULARISED NATURE OF INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES, SHAREHOLDERS ARE 
REQUIRED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS FOR THE APPLICABLE TAX PROVISIONS INCLUDING 
THE TREATMENT THAT MAY BE GIVEN BY THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX OFFICERS IN THEIR CASE, AND 
THE APPROPRIATE COURSE OF ACTION THAT THEY SHOULD TAKE. 
 
THE COMPANY DOES NOT ACCEPT ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACCURACY OR OTHERWISE OF  
SUCH ADVICE. THEREFORE, SHAREHOLDERS CANNOT RELY ON THIS ADVICE AND THE SUMMARY 
INCOME TAX IMPLICATIONS RELATING TO THE TREATMENT OF INCOME TAX IN THE CASE OF 
BUYBACK OF LISTED EQUITY SHARES ON THE RECOGNISED STOCK EXCHANGE IN INDIA SET OUT 
BELOW SHOULD BE TREATED AS INDICATIVE AND FOR GUIDANCE PURPOSES ONLY.  
 
General: The basis of charge of Indian income-tax depends upon the residential status of the taxpayer during a tax year. The 
Indian tax year runs from April 1 until March 31. A person who is an Indian tax resident is liable to income -tax in India on 
 
61 
 
his worldwide income, subject to certain tax exemptions, which are provided under the Income -tax Act, 1961 (“Act”).  
 
A person who is treated as a non -resident for Indian income -tax purposes is generally subject to tax in India only on such 
person’s India-sourced income (i.e. income which accrues or arises or deemed to accrue or arise in India) and income received 
by such persons in India. In case of shares of a company, the source of income from shares would depend on the “situs” of 
such shares. As per judicial precedents, generally the “situs” of the shares is where a company is “incorporated” and where 
its shares can be transferred.  
 
Accordingly, since the Company is incorporated in India, the Company’s shares should be deemed to be “situated” in India 
and any gains arising to a non-resident on acceptance of such shares under the Buyback should be taxable in India under the 
Act.  
 
Further, the non-resident shareholder can avail benefits of the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“ DTAA”) between 
India and the respective country of which the said shareholder is tax resident subject to satisfying relevant conditions 
including but not limited to (a) conditions present in the said DTAA (if any) read with the relevant provisions of the 
Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting 
(“Multilateral Instrument/ MLI ”) as ratified b y India with the respective country of which the said shareholder is tax 
resident, (b) non -applicability of General Anti- Avoidance Rule (“GAAR”) and (c) providing and maintaining necessary 
information and documents as prescribed under the Act.  
 
The Act also provides for different income-tax rates applicable to the gains arising from the buyback of shares, based on the 
residential status, classification of the shareholder, nature of the income earned etc. The summary of income-tax implications 
on buyback of listed equity shares on the recognised stock exchange in India is set out below. All references to equity shares 
herein refer to listed equity shares unless stated otherwise.  
 
Classification of Shareholders: Shareholders can be classified under the following categories:  
a. Resident Shareholders being:  
• Individuals, Hindu Undivided Family (HUF), Association of Persons (AOP) and Body of Individuals (BOI)  
• Others:  
- Company  
- Other than company 
b. Non Resident Shareholders being:  
• Non Resident Indians (NRIs)  
• Foreign Institution Investors (FIIs)/ Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs)  
• Others:  
- Company  
- Other than company 
 
Classification of Income: 
Members may note that as per the Income-tax Act, 1961, (“the IT Act”) as amended by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2024, the 
entire consideration paid by company to its shareholders on b uyback of shares shall be considered as dividend with effect 
from October 1, 2024 onwards. In this regard, a new clause (f) has been inserted in section 2(22) of the IT Act, which provides 
that “dividend” includes any payment by a company on purchase of its own shares from a shareholder in accordance with the 
provisions of section 68 of the Companies Act, 2013. Hence, any consideration paid to shareholders on account of a buyback 
of shares is taxable in the hands of the shareholders as dividend. 
 
Section 46A of the Income Tax Act which provides for capital gains taxation in the hands of the shareholders upon buy-back 
of shares by the company is amended with effect from October 1, 2024 which states that in the case of buy- back of shares, 
the consideration received by the shareholder will be deemed to be Nil for the purpose of computing capital gains. 
Consequently, a capital loss will arise in the hands of the shareholder equivalent to the cost of acquisition of the shares bought 
back. 
 
The Company shall be required to deduct tax at source (TDS) or do withholding of taxes (WHT) from the consideration of 
buyback at the time of making the payment to shareholders. To enable us to determine the appropriate TDS/WHT rate as 
applicable, members are requested to submit relevant documents, as specified in the paragraphs below. In the absence of any 
documents from shareholders the TDS or WHT would be done at the standard prescribed rates under the Income Tax Act . 
 
 
62 
 
The residential status of the shareholders would be taken as per the information available with the depositories (NSDL/CDSL) 
or the Registrar and Share Transfer Agent (KFin Technologies Limited) as on Record Date for the Buyback.  
 
Tax Deduction at Source / Withholding of Taxes: 
For resident shareholders, taxes shall be deducted at source under Section 194 of the IT Act as follows:  
 
Members having valid Permanent Account Number (PAN) 10%* or as notified by the Government of India (GOI) 
Members not having PAN / valid PAN 20% or as notified by the GOI 
* As per Section 139AA of the IT Act, every individual person who has been allotted a PAN and who is eligible to obtain Aadhaar, shall 
be required to link the PAN with Aadhaar. In case of failure to comply with this, the PAN allotted shall be deemed to be invalid / inoperative 
and he shall be liable to all consequences under the IT Act and tax shall be deducted at the higher rates as provided in sect ion 206AA of 
the IT Act, 1961 i.e., 20% of tax deduction at source. 
 
However, no tax shall be deducted to resident individual shareholders if the total of all dividends and buyback consideration 
as dividend to be received by them during financial year 2025-2026 does not exceed in aggregate ₹ 10,000.  
 
Further no tax shall be deducted in cases where individual shareholder provide Form 15G / Form 15H (Form 15G is applicable 
to resident individual shareholders and Form 15H is applicable to resident individual shareholders aged 60 years or more), 
subject to conditions specified in the IT Act. If during the financial year 2025-2026 above mentioned Forms become invalid 
then tax would be deducted on total payments made during the financial year 2025 -2026 from the buyback consideration. 
PAN is mandatory for shar eholders providing Form 15G / 15H. Resident shareholders may also submit declaration or 
document specifying the provisions of IT Act to claim a lower / nil tax  deducted at source. Shareholders may also provide a 
Lower Tax Deduction Certificate (LTDC) certificate issued by the Income Tax Department under Section 197 or any other 
section of the IT Act, which authorizes company to deduct TDS at a lower rate instead of the standard prescribed rate under 
IT Act. 
 
For non-resident shareholders, income tax is  required to be withheld (WHT) from consideration of buyback in accordance 
with the provisions of Section 195 or Section 196D or any other applicable sections of the Income Tax Act, as dividend. The 
current withholding tax is 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess as below) or as notified by the GOI.  
 
Non-resident shareholders may also provide a Lower Tax Deduction Certificate (LTDC) certificate issued by the Income Tax 
Department under Section 195 or any other section of the IT Act, which authorizes company to deduct WHT  at a lower rate 
instead of the standard prescribed rate under IT Act.  
 
However, as per Section 90 of the IT Act, non- resident shareholders can avail the provisions of the certain Double Tax 
Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) provided they satisfy conditions such as non- applicability of the General Anti- Avoidance 
Rule (“GAAR”), read with Multilateral Instrument (MLI), between India and the country of tax residence of the shareholders, 
if such DTAA has beneficial provisions with respect to buyback consideration which are considered payable as dividend and 
shareholders fulfill all requir ements of DTAA. For this purpose, i.e., to avail the benefits under the DTAA read with MLI, 
non-resident shareholders will have to provide all the following documents: 
 
• Copy of the PAN card allotted by the Indian income tax authorities duly attested by the shareholders or details as 
prescribed under rule 37BC of the Income-tax Rules, 1962 in absence of PAN Card. 
• Copy of the Tax Residency Certificate for financial year 2025 -26 obtained from the revenue or tax authorities of the 
country of tax residence, duly attested by shareholders/authorized signatory  
• Electronic Form 10F as per notification no. 03/2022 dated July 16, 2022 issued by the Central Board of Direct Tax. 
Notification can be read under 
-notification-no-3-2022-systems.pdf (incometaxindia.gov.in)}. Form 10F can be 
obtained electronically through the e -filing portal of the income tax website at 
https://www.incometax.gov.in/iec/foportal/. 
• Self-declaration by the shareholders of having no permanent establishment in India in accordance with the applicable 
tax treaty 
• Self-declaration of beneficial ownership of equity shares by the non-resident shareholder 
• Self-declaration of fulfilling all conditions of tax treaty for be ing eligible to claim benefit of the tax treaty (DTAA) 
read with Multilateral Instrument (MLI).

Taxation for American Depositary Shares (‘ADS’) holders  
 
The withdrawal of Equity Shares underlying ADSs, the re -deposit of Equity Shares not tendered or not accepted in the 
Buyback against the creation of ADSs, and the sale in the Buyback of Equity Shares withdrawn may have various tax 
implications in India, the United States, and other jurisdictions that differ from, and may be substantially more onerous than, 
those that would be applicable to sales of ADSs on the NYSE. Such tax implications could vary depending on several factors, 
including the period of holdi ng the securities, the residential status of the holder, the classification of the holder, the nature 
of the income earned, etc. 
a. India 
Withdrawal and Re-Deposit of Equity Shares by ADS Holders: In addition, because of the very limited precedent, whether 
the re-deposit of Equity Shares against the creation of ADSs is subject to Indian taxation is particularly unclear. The Company 
cannot assure ADS holders that tax will not be imposed or whether the bank, broker or other nominee in India with whom 
individual ADS holders establish an Indian Demat account (Subtype DR)  and a Brokerage Account will withhold taxes in 
connection with the re-deposit of such Equity Shares. In light of the foregoing, ADS holders are advised to consult their legal, 
financial and tax advisors and the bank, broker or other nominee in India with whom they intend to establish an Indian Demat 
account (Subtype DR) and a Brokerage Account to understand the potential implications of a withdrawal and re -deposit of 
Equity Shares prior to their making a request to the Depositary to effect the withdrawal of the Equity Shares underlying their 
respective ADSs. 
 
In addition to the foregoing Indian taxation considerations, ADS holders should consider potential taxation under the laws of 
their country of residency and other jurisdictions in which they may be subject to taxation arising out of the withdrawal and  
re- deposit of Equity Shares. 
b. United States 
i. Withdrawal and Re-Deposit of Equity Shares by ADS Holders. 
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, ADS holders generally will be treated as the owners of Equity Shares underlying such ADSs. 
Accordingly, withdrawing Equity Shares underlying ADSs and re-depositing Equity Shares that are not tendered in the Buyback, 
or if tendered, re-depositing Equity Shares that are not accepted in the Buyback generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. 
For further information on the U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to U.S. holders (as defined therein) of ADSs and / or 
Equity Shares, please see the Company’s Form 20-F. 
ii. Tendering Equity Shares in the Buyback. 
 
64 
 
Important information on the tax treatment relevant to tendering Equity Shares in the Buyback has been set forth in a Form 
6-K furnished by the Company with the SEC on or about the date of the  Postal Ballot Notice, as well as in this  Letter of 
Offer. 
 
Each ADS holder should consult their own tax advisor with respect to the U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences of 
withdrawing and re-depositing equity shares, as well as the tax consequences of participating in the Buyback.  
 
EACH U.S. HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE TREATMENT OF 
DIVIDENDS AND SUCH U.S. HOLDER’S ELIGIBILITY FOR REDUCED RATE OF TAXATION UNDER THE 
LAW IN EFFECT FOR THE YEAR OF THE BUYBACK AND WHETHER ANY FOREIGN TAX CREDITS ARE 
AVAILABLE TO IT IN RESPECT OF INDIAN TAX, IF ANY. 
 
STT: As an overall point, since the Buyback is to be undertaken through the settlement mechanism on the Indian Stock 
Exchanges, such transaction is chargeable to the Securities Transaction Tax (“STT”). STT is a tax payable in India on the 
value of securities on every purchase or sale of specified securities that are listed on the r ecognised Stock Exchanges in 
India. Currently, the STT rate applicable on the purchase or sale of shares on the stock exchange is 0.10% of the value of 
the transaction.  
Rate of Surcharge and Cess  in case of Non -Resident: In addition to the basic tax rate, surcharge, education cess and 
secondary and higher education cess are leviable as follows:  
Surcharge:  
In case of individuals, HUF, AOP and BOI: Surcharge at 15% is leviable where the total income exceeds ₹ 10 million 
(approximately US$ 0.11 million) and at 10% where the total income exceeds ₹ 5 million (approximately US$ 0.06 million) 
but does not exceed ₹ 10 million (approximately US$ 0.11 million).  
 
In case of foreign companies: Surcharge at 5% is leviable where the total income exceeds ₹ 100 million (approximately 
US$ 1.14 million) and at 2% where the total income exceeds ₹ 10 million (approximately US$ 0.11 million) but does not 
exceed ₹ 100 million (approximately US$ 1.14 million).  
 
The U.S. dollar amounts are based on the exchange rate of ₹ 88.06/USD as of September 19, 2025  
(Source: http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h10/hist/dat00_in.htm) 
Cess:  
Heath and Education Cess at 4% is leviable in all cases 
Taxation for American Depositary Share Holders: As described in more detail in the Postal Ballot Notice, a holder of ADSs 
of the Company may participate in the Buyback by withdrawing his or her ADSs from the depositary facility, such that 
they become holders of Equity Shares as of the Record Date and then participating in the Buyback.  
There can be no assurance that the Equity Shares offered by an ADS holder in the Buyback will be accepted.  
ADS holders are advised to consult their legal, financial and tax advisors for advice prior to participating in the Buyback, 
including advice related to any related regulatory approvals and tax issues.  
Income-tax implications on withdrawal and re-deposit of Equity Shares:  
• While there are arguments in favour that conversion of ADS into shares should not be subject to capital gains tax, 
this view is not free from doubt as law is not very clear on this aspect.  
• The shares which would not be accepted by the Company for buyback could get reconverted into ADS. As far as 
taxability of such reconversion is concerned, there are two possible views i.e. whether such reconversion of shares 
into ADS is a taxable transfer a nd accordingly would attract capital gains tax or vice versa. While there are 
arguments supporting both the views, the view that such reconversion is not a taxable transfer may be construed 
to be a better view.  
THE ABOVE DISCLOSURE ON TAXATION SETS OUT THE PROVISIONS OF LAW IN A SUMMARY MANNER 
ONLY AND IS NOT A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR LISTING OF ALL POTENTIAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF 
THE DISPOSAL OF EQUITY SHARES. THIS DISCLOSURE IS NEITHER BINDING ON ANY REGULATORS NOR 
CAN THERE BE ANY ASSURANCE THAT THEY WILL NOT TAKE A POSITION CONTRARY TO THE 
COMMENTS MENTIONED HEREIN. HENCE, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR OWN TAX ADVISORS 
FOR THE TAX PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO YOUR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.  
 
Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences  
 
65 
 
The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant with respect to 
a participation in the buyback of Equity Shares to U.S. holders (as defined below) and is for general information only. For 
purposes of this discussion, “U.S. holders” are individuals who are citizens or residents of the United States, corporations 
(or other entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created in or under the laws of the United 
States or any political subdivision thereof or therein, estates, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation 
regardless of its source and trusts having a valid election to be treated as U.S. persons (within the meaning of Section 
7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Code”)) in effect under U.S. Treasury Regulations or for 
which a U.S. court exercises primary supervision and a U.S. person has the authority to control all substantial decisions.  
This summary is limited to U.S. holders who hold Equity Shares or ADSs as capital assets  (generally, property held for 
investment). In addition, this summary is limited to U.S. holders who are not residents in India for purposes of the 
Convention between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of India for the 
Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income (“ Treaty”). If a 
partnership (or an entity treated as a part nership or a pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds the 
Equity Shares or ADSs, the tax treatment of a partner or an owner of such entity will generally depend upon the status of 
the partner or owner and upon the activities of the partnership or such pass -through entity. A partner or an owner in a 
partnership or a pass-through entity holding Equity Shares or ADSs should consult its own tax advisor.  
This summary does not address any tax considerations arising under the laws of any U.S. state or local or non- U.S. 
jurisdiction, potential application of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income, or tax considerations under 
any U.S. non- income tax laws. In addition, this summary does not address tax considerations applicable to holders that 
may be subject to special tax rules, such as banks, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, pension plans, 
real estate investment trusts, financial institutions, dealers in securities or currencies, tax-exempt entities, persons liable for 
alternative minimum tax, persons that hold Equity Shares or ADSs as a position in a “straddle” or as part of a “hedging” 
or “conversion” transaction for tax purposes, persons holding ADSs or Equity Shares through partnerships or other pass -
through entities, persons that have a “functional currency” other than the U.S. dollar or holders of 10% or more, by voting 
power or value, of Equity Shares of the Company, controlled foreign corporations, foreign controlled foreign corporations 
passive foreign investment companies, or corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, persons 
subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to our Equity Shares or ADSs 
being taken into account in an applicable financial statement, persons who hold or receive Equity Shares or ADSs pursuant 
to the exercise of any option or otherwise as compensation, persons deemed t o sell Equity Shares or ADSs under the 
constructive sale provisions of the Code, and certain U.S. expatriates and certain former citizens or long- term residents of 
the United States. 
This summary is based on the Code  as in effect on the date of this document and on U.S. Treasury Regulations in effect 
or, in some cases, proposed, as of the date of this document, as well as judicial and administrative interpretations thereof 
available on or before such date and is based in part on the assumption that each obligation in the Deposit Agreement and 
any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms. All of the foregoing is subject to change, which 
change could apply retroactively and could affect the tax consequences described below.  
EACH PROSPECTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE BUYBACK WHO IS A U.S. HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT 
ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND NON- U.S. 
TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PARTICIPATING IN THE BUYBACK.  
Ownership of ADSs. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. holders generally will be treated as the owners of Equity 
Shares represented by such ADSs. Accordingly, the conversion of ADSs into Equity Shares to participate in the Buyback, 
and the conversion of Equity Shares that are not tendered in the Buyback, or that are  tendered, and not accepted in the 
Buyback, into ADSs generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax.  
Tax Treatment of Buyback. An exchange of Equity Shares for cash by a U.S. holder pursuant to the Buyback will be a 
taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, depending on the applicable U.S. holder’s particular 
circumstances, such tendering U.S. holder will be treated either as recognizing gain or loss from the disposition of the 
Equity Shares or as receiving a distribution from the Company.  
Under Section 302 of the Code, a tendering U.S. holder will recognize gain or loss on the exchange of Equity Shares for 
cash if the exchange:  
• results in a “substantially disproportionate” redemption with respect to such U.S. holder; or  
• is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to the U.S. holder.  
An exchange of Equity Shares for cash generally will be a substantially disproportionate redemption with respect to a U.S. 
holder if (1) the percentage of the voting stock owned by such U.S. holder immediately after the exchange is less than 80% 
of the percentage of the voting stock owned by such U.S. holder immediately before the exchange , and (2) immediately 
 
66 
 
after the exchange the U.S. holder owns less than 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled 
to vote. In applying the Section 302 tests, each U.S. holder must take into account Equity Shares and ADSs that such U.S. 
holder constructively owns under certain attribution rules, pursuant to which a U.S. holder will be treated as owning any 
Equity Shares and ADSs owned by certain family members (which family attribution, in certain circumstances, may be 
waived) and related entities, and Equity Shares and ADSs that the U.S. holder has the right to acquire by exercise of an 
option. Each U.S. holder is expected to consult with its own tax advisor with respect to the application of such attribution 
rules given such U.S. holder’s particular circumstances.  
If an exchange of Equity Shares for cash fails to satisfy the “substantially disproportionate” test, the U.S. holder may 
nonetheless satisfy the “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” test. An exchange of Equity Shares for cash will satisfy 
the “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” test if it results in a “meaningful reduction” of the U.S. holder’s equity interest 
in the company given such U.S. holder’s particular facts and circumstances. The Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) has 
indicated in published rulings that a relatively minor reduction of the proportionate equity interest of a U.S. holder whose 
relative equity interest is minimal and who does not exercise any control over or participate in the management of corporate 
affairs should be tre ated as “not essentially equivalent to a dividend.” Each U.S. holder should consult its tax advisors 
regarding the application of the rules of Section 302 in its particular circumstances. Because the Section 302 tests are 
applied on a “stockholder -by-stockholder” basis, the Buyback may be a sale or exchange for certain  U.S. holders and a 
distribution for others.  
Sale or Exchange: Subject to the “passive foreign investment company” (“PFIC ”) rules described below, if a U.S. holder 
is treated as recognizing gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes from the disposition of Equity Shares for cash, 
such gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized and the U.S. holder’s 
tax basis, determined in U.S. dollars, in the Equity Shares. Gain or loss recognized will be long- term capital gain or loss 
with respect to Equi ty Shares held for more than 12 months at the time of the sale or other disposition,  and any gain 
recognized generally will be income from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Long-
term capital gains of non- corporate U.S. holders are generally taxed at preferential rates. Capital gains realized by a U.S. 
holder upon sale of Equity Shares may be subject to tax in India, including withholding tax. See “Indian Taxation” above. 
Due to limitations on foreign tax credits, however, a U.S. holder may not be able to utilize any such taxes as a credit against 
the U.S. holder’s federal income tax liability. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax treatment 
to them if the Buyback is treated as a sale or exchange.  
Distribution: If a U.S. holder is not treated under the Section 302 tests (discussed above) as recognizing gain or loss on an 
exchange of Equity Shares for cash, such U.S. holder will be treated as having received a distribution from the Company. 
The gross amount of the distribution will generally be treated as dividend income to the extent made from the current or 
accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles) of the Company. Such dividends 
will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally allowed to corporate U.S. holders. To the extent that the 
amount of the Buyback exceeds the Company’s current and accumulated earnings and profits (if any) as determined under 
U.S. federal income tax principles, such excess will be treated first as a tax-free return of the U.S. holder’s tax basis in the 
Equity Shares and thereafter as capital gain.  
The Company does not intend to calculate its earnings and profits according to U.S. tax accounting principles. Accordingly, 
notwithstanding the discussion in the preceding paragraphs, if the Buyback is treated as a distribution on Equity Shares, 
such distribution will generally be taxed as a dividend for U.S. tax purposes.  
Subject to certain conditions and limitations, including the PFIC rules described below, dividends paid to non -corporate 
U.S. holders, including individuals, may be eligible for a reduced rate of taxation if the Company is deemed to be a 
“qualified foreign corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A qualified foreign corporation includes a foreign 
corporation if (1) its shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States, or (2) it is eligible 
for the benefits under a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States, including the Treaty. Our ADSs are listed 
on NYSE. We believe, but cannot assure you, that the ADSs will be readily tradable on an established securities market in 
the United States and that we will be a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends paid on the ADSs. Based on 
existing guidance, it is not clear whether a dividend on an Equity Share will be treated as a qualified dividend, because the 
Equity Shares are not themselves listed on a U.S. exchange. However, the Company may be eligible for benefits under the 
Treaty. A corporation is not a qualified foreign corporation if it is a PFIC in the current taxable year or the prior taxable  
year (as discussed below).  
If the proceeds are paid in Indian Rupees, the amount of the proceeds included in the income of a U.S. holder will be the 
U.S. dollar value of the payments made in Indian Rupees, determined at a spot exchange rate between Indian Rupees and 
U.S. dollars on the date such proceeds are included in the income of the U.S. holder, regardless of whether the payment is 
in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Generally, gain or loss, if any, resulting from currency exchange fluctuations during the 
 
67 
 
period from the date the dividend is paid to the date such payment is converted into U.S. dollars will be treated as U.S. 
source ordinary income or loss. 
EACH PROSPECTIVE PARTICIPANT IN A COMPANY BUYBACK  SHOULD CONSULT HIS, HER OR ITS 
OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND NON- U.S. TAX 
CONSEQUENCES OF PARTICIPATING IN THE BUYBACK  AND WHETHER ANY FOREIGN TAX 
CREDITS ARE AVAILABLE TO IT IN RESPECT OF INDIAN WITHHOLDING TAX, IF ANY.  
Passive Foreign Investment Company: A non- U.S. corporation will be classified as a PFIC for U.S. Federal income tax 
purposes if either: 
• 75% or more of its gross income for the taxable year is passive income; or  
• on average for the taxable year by value, if 50% or more of its assets produce or are held for the production of 
passive income.  
 
The Company does not believe that it satisfies either of the tests for PFIC status for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025 , 
and the Company does not expect to satisfy either of the tests for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026. However, because 
this determination is made on an annual basis and depends on a variety of factors (including the Company’s market 
capitalization), no assurance can be given that the Company was not considered a PFIC for the fiscal year ended March 31, 
2025, or that the Company wi ll not be considered a PFIC for the current fiscal year and/or future fiscal years. If the 
Company were to be a PFIC for any taxable year, U.S. holders would be required to pay an interest charge together with 
tax calculated at an ordinary income rates on “excess distributions,” as the term is defined in relevant provisions of U.S. 
tax laws, and on any gain on a sale or other disposition of Equity Shares, unless a U.S. holder makes a “QEF election” or 
a “mark-to-market” election, as described below. In addi tion, individual U.S. holders will not be eligible for the reduced 
rates of dividend taxation described above if the Company is a PFIC for the fiscal year of the dividend payment or the 
preceding taxable year.  
If the Company is a PFIC in any year, so long as the Equity Shares or ADSs are and remain “marketable,” a U.S. holder 
may be able to avoid the excess distribution rules described above by having made a timely so- called “mark-to-market” 
election with respec t to such U.S. holder’s Equity Shares or ADSs. The Equity Shares or ADSs will be “marketable” as 
long as they remain regularly traded on a national securities exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange, or a foreign 
securities exchange that is regulated  or supervised by a governmental authority of the country in which the market is 
located. A mark -to-market election will be effective for the taxable year for which the election is made and for all 
subsequent taxable years, unless the Equity Shares or ADSs  are no longer regularly traded on a qualified exchange or the 
IRS consents to the revocation of the election. No assurances may be given regarding whether the Equity Shares or ADSs 
will qualify, or will continue to be qualified, as being regularly traded in this regard. However, because a mark -to-market 
election cannot be made for any lower-tier PFICs that the Company may own, a U.S. holder may continue to be subject to 
the PFIC rules with respect to any indirect interest in any investments held by the Company that are treated as an equity 
interest in a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including the Company’s subsidiaries. U.S. holders should consult 
their own tax advisors with respect to making a mark- to-market election and the tax consequences of the Buyback if such 
an election is in effect.  
In addition, if the Company is a PFIC in any year, a U.S. holder might be able to avoid the excess distribution rules 
described above by making a timely so-called “qualified electing fund” election, or QEF election, to be taxed currently on 
his, her or its pro rata portion of the Company’s income and gain. However, the Company has not provided and does not 
plan to provide information necessary for the QEF election, so such election would not have been available to U.S. holders. 
In addition, certain information reporting obligations on IRS Form 8621 may apply to U.S. holders if the Company is 
determined to be a PFIC, including in the year of a sale or disposition.  
Backup Withholding Tax and Information Reporting. Any dividends paid, or proceeds on a sale of, Equity Shares to or by 
a U.S. holder may be subject to U.S. information reporting, and backup withholding, currently at a rate of 24%, may apply 
unless such holder is an exempt recipient or provides a U.S. taxpayer identification number, certifies that such holder is 
not subject to backup withholding and otherwise complies with any applicable backup withholding requirements. Any 
amount withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or credit against the holder’s U.S. federal 
income tax, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS.  
THE ABOVE SUMMARY IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OF ALL TAX 
CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO PARTICIPATION IN THE BUYBACK. YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH 
YOUR OWN TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX 
LAWS TO YOUR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, AS WELL AS ANY ADDITIONAL TAX 
CONSEQUENCES RESULTING FROM PARTICIPATION IN THE BUYBACK, INCLUDING THE 
 
68 
 
APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF THE TAX LAWS OF ANY U.S. STATE OR LOCAL OR NON- U.S. 
JURISDICTION AND ANY ESTATE, GIFT AND INHERITANCE LAWS.

manner as described further in Section 23.

certain actions in order to withdraw the Equity Shares underlying the ADSs held by them in advance of the Record Date, i.e., 
November 14, 2025 and should have become holders of Equity Shares on the Record Date. In the Postal Ballot Notice, the Company 
had intimated that ADS holders had approximately 49 calendar days from the date of the Postal Ballot Notice to take such steps as 
may be required for ADS holders to hold Equity Shares as on the Record Date. ADS holders are advised to refer to paragraph 22.26-

in the medium term and for returning surplus funds to the shareholders in an effective and efficient manner  in line with its Capital 
Allocation Policy. The Buyback is being undertaken for the reasons set forth in Section 8. 
What are the significant conditions to the Offer? 
Under the Buyback Regulations, the Company is not permitted to withdraw the Buyback Offer once the public announcement of

How does an Eligible Shareholder tender his/her Equity Shares? 
In order to tender Equity Shares in the Buyback, Eligible Shareholders will have to place orders through their Seller Members (stock 
brokers) on the separate acquisition window provided on BSE and NSE for the Buyback. Eligible Shareholders will also have to 
submit the relevant documents required along with their Tender Forms. Seller Members can enter orders for dematerialized Equity 
Shares as well as physical Equity Shares. See Sections 22 and 2 3 and the Tender Form for details of documents required from the 
shareholders and the process for tendering. 
Can an Eligible Shareholder tender some, but not all, of his Equity Shares?  
Yes. The maximum number of Equity Shares that an Eligible Shareholder may tender in the Buyback is equal to the number of 
Equity Shares held on the Record Date. An Eligible Shareholder is free to tender some or all of their Equity Shares. See Sect ion 23 
and the Tender Form for further details. 
Once an Eligible Shareholder has tendered Equity Shares in the Buyback, can they withdraw their tender?  
Yes. Modification/cancellation of orders from a single Eligible Shareholder will be allowed during the Tendering Period of the 
Buyback offer. The offer and withdrawal rights will be available to an Eligible Shareholder during the Tendering Period i.e. from 
November 20, 2025 to November 26, 2025. See Section 23. 
How does an Eligible Shareholder withdraw Equity Shares they have previously tendered?  
An order can be cancelled or modified by an Eligible Shareholder who has tendered their Equity Shares during the Tendering Period 
 
78 
 
by contacting their Seller Member through whom the initial bid was placed by providing a request for modification/cancellation via 
his registered email address or registered telephone number or by visiting the Seller Member’s branch and submitting a writte n 
request. 
Do the Promoters, Directors or Key Managerial Personnel of the Company intend to tender their Equity Shares in the 
Buyback? 
The Promoter and Promoter Group and persons in control of the Company have an option to participate in the Buyback. In this 
regard, the Promoter and Promoter group have expressed their intention to not participate in the Buyback vide their letters dated 
September 14, 2025, September 16, 2025, Septem ber 17, 2025, September 18, 2025 and September 19, 2025. The Directors and 
Key Managerial Personnel of the Company are eligible to participate in the Buyback on the same terms as all other Eligible 
Shareholders. See Section 11. 
If an Eligible Shareholder decides not to tender, how will the Buyback affect their Equity Shares?  
Shareholders who choose not to tender their Equity Shares will enjoy a resultant increase in their shareholding post closure of the 
Buyback. See Section 23. 
When will the Company pay for the Equity Shares tendered by an Eligible Shareholder and accepted in the Buyback?  
If the Equity Shares tendered by an Eligible Shareholder are accepted by the Company in the Offer, the Company will pay such 
Eligible Shareholder the purchase price, in cash, promptly after the expiration of the Offer and no later than 5 (five) worki ng days 
from the closure of the Offer Period. See Section 23. 
Will the Eligible Shareholder have to pay brokerage commissions or other costs and expenses if they tender their Equity 
Shares? 
The Buyback consideration received by the Eligible Shareholder from their respective Seller Member, in respect of accepted Equity 
Shares, could be net of tax deducted at source, costs, charges and expenses (including brokerage), and the Company accepts no 
responsibility to bear or pay such additional cost, charges, and expenses (including brokerage) incurred solely by the selling Eligible 
Shareholders. See Section 23. 
What are the income tax consequences if an Eligible Shareholder tenders their Equity Shares?  
Tendering Equity Shares in the Buyback. The Finance (No. 2) Act, 2024 has made amendments in relation to buyback of shares 
shifting the tax liability in the hands of the shareholders and the Company is not required to pay tax on the distributed income. Under 
Section 2(22)(f) of the ITA, the entire amount paid by a domestic company for the buyback of its shares is treated as dividen d 
income in the hands of shareholders (resident or non-resident), taxable under the head Income from Other Sources. Section 46A of 
the IT Act which provides for capital gains taxation in the hands of the shareholders upon buy- back of shares by the company is 
amended with effect from October 1, 2024 which states that in the case of buy- back of shares, the consideration received by t he 
shareholder will be deemed to be Nil for the purpose of computing capital gains. Consequently, a capital loss will arise in the hands 
of the shareholder equivalent to the cost of acquisition of the shares bought back.  The Company shall be required to de duct tax at 
source (TDS) or withholding of taxes (WHT) at the time of making the payment of total buyback consideration to shareholders 
which will be treated as dividend under the IT Act. Refer to Section 24 for detailed note on Taxation.  
If the Eligible Shareholder is a U.S. holder (as defined in Section 24 under heading titled “ United States - Certain Material U.S. 
Federal Income Tax Consequences”), his exchange of Equity Shares for cash pursuant to the Buyback will be a taxable transaction 
to such Eligible Shareholder for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, depending on the particular circumstances, a nd 
subject to the “passive foreign  investment company” (“PFIC”) rules described in Section 24 under heading titled “United State s - 
Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences,” the Eligible Shareholder will be treated either as recognizing gain or loss 
from the disposition of the Equity Shares or as receiving a distribution from the Company. Any gain or loss recognized by the 
Eligible Shareholder will generally be long-term capital gain or loss with respect to Equity Shares held for more than 12 months at 
the time of the disposition. A distribution will generally be taxed to the Eligible Shareholder as a dividend for U.S.  federal income 
tax purposes to the extent it is made from the current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income 
tax principles) of the Company. Refer to Section 24 for detailed note on Taxation.  
Withdrawal and Re -deposit of Equity Shares . While there are arguments in favour that withdrawal of Equity Shares underlying 
ADSs should not be subject to Indian capital gains tax, this view is not free from doubt as the law is not very clear on this  aspect. 
Similarly, whether the re-deposit of Equity Shares against the creation of ADSs (where such shares are not accepted for Buyback) 
is subject to Indian taxation is also unclear. 
Having said that, the Indian, United States and other tax consequences resulting from participation in the Buyback are comple x. 
Each Eligible Shareholder should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of participating in the Buybac k. 
 
79 
 
See Section 24. 
What should an Eligible Shareholder do if they have lost their share certificate and wish to participate in the Buyback?  
If an Eligible Shareholder holding shares in the physical form has lost their share certificate(s), they will need to obtain a duplicate 
share certificate and can thereafter tender their Equity Shares in the same manner as other Eligible Shareholders holding Equ ity 
Shares in the physical form. See Section 23 and the Tender Form. 
Who can a shareholder talk to in case of any questions relating to the Buyback?  
In case of any clarifications or to address investor grievance, the shareholder(s) may contact the Registrar to the Buyback from 
Monday to Friday between 10:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Indian Standard Time on all working days, contact details for whom are set
