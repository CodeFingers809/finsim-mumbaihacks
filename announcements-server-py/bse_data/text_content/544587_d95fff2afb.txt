Midwest Limited, a leading quartz processor and India’s largest 
producer of Black Galaxy and Absolute Black Granite, is also 
expanding its presence into Heavy Mineral Sands and Rare Earth 
Minerals. We achieved a major milestone with impressive debut on 
India’s premier stock exchanges. Supported by seasoned 
leadership team, access to diversified mineral reserve base, 
constant strive for operational efficiency, we are on the journey of 
becoming a world class integrated materials processing company. 
 
Coming to H1FY26 performance, I’m pleased to report that we 
have achieved significant growth in Revenue, EBITDA, & PAT of 
8%, 16%, & 17% (YoY) respectively. We remain steadfast in our 
pursuit of the long-term vision of becoming one of the world’s top 
three producers of Quartz Grit and Powder, South East Asia’s 
largest producer of Titanium feedstock, and among the world’s 
leading producers of Rare Earth Oxides.
