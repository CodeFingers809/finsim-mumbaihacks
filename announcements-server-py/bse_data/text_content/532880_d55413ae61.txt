Independent Auditor's Review Report on the Quarterly and Year to Date Unaudited Standalone 
Financial Results of the Company Pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended 
Review Report to 
The Board of Directors 
Omaxe Limited 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Unaudited Standalone Financial Results of 
Omaxe Limited (the "Company") for the quarter ended 30th September 2025 and year to date 
from 1st April 2025 to 30th September 2025 (the "Statement") attached herewith, being 
submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended, (the "Listing 
Regulations"). 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and approved by the 
Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 (Ind AS 34), "Interim 
Financial Reporting" prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 as amended, 
read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted 
in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing regulations. Our responsibility is 
to express a conclusion on the statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity", issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to 
whether the statement is free from material misstatement. A review of interim financial 
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and 
accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing 
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all 
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit 
opinion. 
4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standards ('Ind AS') 
specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 as amended, read with relevant rules 
issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed 
the information required to be disclosed in terms of the Listing Regulations, including the 
manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.

We draw attention to note number 6 and 7 of the unaudited standa

2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Holding Company's Management and approved 
by the Holding Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the
