INVESTMENT 
Dear Shareholder, 
I am happy to share with you the financial results of Bajaj Holdings & Investment Ltd. (BH!L) for the 
half year ended 30 September 2025. 
An interim dividend of x 65 per equity share (650%) was declared on 16 September 2025 and paid on 
14 October 2025, amounting to ~ 723 crore. 
Details about BHIL and companies consolidated in it, are included at the end of this letter. 
On the macro front the recent GST reforms, I believe, should provide tailwinds for growth for our 
automobile and financial service businesses, in coming quarters and years. H1 FY26 was a period of 
strong growth across our major businesses. 
In H1 FY26, BHIL sold 1.04 crore equity shares of its associate company, Bajaj Finserv Ltd. (BFS) 
through a block deal for part funding of equity stake in two insurance companies. Net of relevant 
book costs and transactions costs, profit on sale of equity shares of BFS is included in consolidated 
and standalone profit. BFS continues to be an associate of BHIL. 
In this backdrop, BHIL'.s consolidated profit after tax for H1 FY26 increased to x 5,046 crore 
v/s ~ 3,047 crore in H1 FY25. 
On the macro front, the recent 
GST reforms, I believe, shouid
