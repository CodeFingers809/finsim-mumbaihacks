RBZ is one of the leading organized manufacturers of gold jewellery in India. We are a unique 
jewellery company with diversified business model, wherein we offer products to national 
retailers on wholesale and job work basis, as well as direct customers from our flagship retail 
store in Ahmedabad. We have a state -of-art manufacturing facilit y equipped with advanced 
casting, laser and 3D printing technologies, which is supported by 200 plus professionals and 
250 skilled artisans.  Because of our manufacturing setup and presence across both wholesale 
and retail segment, we are able to garner better margins than our peers. We offer a diverse range 
of jewellery collection comprising of different manufacturing techniques and varieties, but our 
specialties lies in antique gold bridal jewellery. 
Our flagship showroom Hari t Zaveri Jewellers in Ahmedaba d offers bridal occasion and daily 
wear jewellery across diverse price ranges.  The retail product portfolio features a diverse 
selection of gold studded and other jewellery, including bangles, chain, necklaces, rings and 
earrings etc. We are also planning to expand our retail presence in Rajkot, Surat and Baroda as 
well. 
Now, coming to the financial highlights for the 2nd Quarter of the Financial Year 2026 under 
review: 
Despite gold price touching lifetime high, we remain aligned with our revenue guidance, revenue 
from operations for the 2nd quarter stood at INR 145 crores, marking a strong growth of 24% 
year-on-year and 92% quarter -on-quarter. This performance was driven  by successful new 
launches of design, productivity improvement and positive consumer sentiment from early onset 
of the festive season. EBITDA for the quarter rose sharply at INR 28 crores, an increase of 105% 
year-on-year and 118% subsequently, with margins expanding significantly up 766 basis points 
Y-on-Y and 230 basis points Q-on-Q to 19.5%. PAT for the quarter stood at INR 19 crores, 
reflecting a robust growth of 130% year -on-year and 162 % quarter-on-quarter, with PAT 
margins improving to 12.82%. 
For the first half of the Financial Year 2 026, our revenue from operations stood at INR 221 
crores, reflecting a healthy growth of 11% Y-on-Y. EBITDA came at around INR 41 crores, up 
47% Y-on-Y, with margins expanding by 455 basis points to 18.62%. Net profit for the first half 
is INR 26 crores, growth of 50% Y-on-Y, with PAT margins improving to 11.64%. 
In terms of segmental performance for the 2nd Quarter of the Financial Year 2026: 
Our retail revenue stood at INR 87 crores, registering a growth of 18% Y-on-Y. Wholesale 
revenue came in at INR 56 crores, up 40% compared to the same period last year, while job 
work revenue grew 22% at INR 3 crores. For the first half of Financial Year 2026, retail revenue 
grew by 11% Y-on-Y to INR 132 crores. Wholesale revenue increased 11% Y-on-Y to INR 84 
crores and job work recorded a healthy growth of 17% year-on-year to INR 4 crores. We closed 
the first half of the year on a very strong note, driven by robust traction across both occasion and

daily wear. This growth was supported by evolving consumer preference and enhanced product 
offerings and early offset of festive season. 
During the period, we actively participated in multiple exhibitions to s trengthen our market 
presence, 5 national level B2B exhibitions and 7 B2C exhibitions, significantly enhancing the 
brand visibility and customer engagement. We have also launched several impactful digital 
marketing campaigns, showcasing both our festive da ily wear collections  in occasion wear 
campaigns, such as Chand, Ranga t, Navratri Bridal and Akshay Tritiya  festive highlights, our 
exquisite Gold Polki and Antique collections were there.  In Daily wear campaigns, Humsafar 
and Rozana celebrated lightweight, elegant collections for everyday use. 
Our retail expansion front, encouraged by the strong performance of our Ahmedabad showroom, 
we plan to strengthen our presence in Gujarat by expanding in other key cities such as Rajkot 
and Surat, with at least one o f them opening in the quarter 4 of this financial year. Building on 
our strong Q2 performance, we remain focused on accelerating growth across segments.  Our 
continued emphasis on design innovation and well -diversified product mix and operational 
excellence positions us well to drive sustainable growth in evolving a dynamic market 
environment. We are witnessing encouraging demand trends and expecting robust consumer 
traction during the upcoming wedding season in retail, particularly led by strong interest in  
occasion wear category. However, while the overall demand remains positive, we are also 
cautious on the revenue trends given the recent volatility in global precious metal prices. 
With this, now I open the floor for question-and-answer session. Thank you. 
Moderator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question -and-answer session. Our first question 
comes from the line of Sahil Patani from Strokes Capital. Please go ahead. 
Sahil Patani: Hi, thanks for the opportunity and congratulations on a very strong quarter. I wanted to 
understand in the presentation, we mentioned that RBZ has about 1% market share in the 
organized wholesale gold jewelry market, right? So, since this industry is like so fragmented, 
what are we kind of doing to consistently gain market share in this business? 
Harit Zaveri: So, Sahil, thanks for asking the question. And correct, we have 1% market share when it comes 
to organized, this occasion wear category. Given that in order to  do the market penetration so 
important thing would be launching of new designs. And that we have been doing so since now 
many years. The design team is efficient.  We are having a very organized approach when it 
comes to approaching season, building up capabilities in terms of, are there on month to month 
basis to understand that seasonality is there. There can be a demand pressure and can we handle 
the demand pressure. So, generally market penetration right now because of high gold prices are 
done by reducing the weight and not compromising on looks or enhancing the looks also 
basically, reviewing the trends and forecast.  With that, a right kind of IT infrastructure is 
essential because organized players would demand delivery in a very short perio d of time. So, 
J EWELLERS LTD

the inventory brokerage is low or that we need to have a right kind of an infrastructure that can 
facilitate, give us right kind of reporting . The whole supply chain of manufacturing can be right 
in place. So, obviously, productivity optimization will be one of the scenarios.  But on the 
penetration side, again, we can do exhibitions. We have already received a warm response when 
we do B2B exhibitions. So, if you see, you can clearly understand on the first half of the year, 
we have done 542 kg or that is almost we have not de-grown on our volumes. So, when you say 
when we are not we have not de -grown on our volumes or we are volume positive in the first 
half, that actually speaks about the strength and the robustness of the company, right? Because 
gold prices has risen now 50%. If any company tells that  okay, I am 20% revenue positive and 
they don't have job work in their portfolio as offerings, that clearly indicates that they are minus 
20% on, let us say, volume terms. But when we say that we are volume positive, even marginally, 
that speaks robustness about the company and it is right kind of penetration strategy. But overall 
to answer, design emphasis, lightweight design, not compromising on looks and strengthening 
the operations by IT and other productivity measures. 
Sahil Patani: Understood. Thanks for that. Now, my second question is usually given like the second half, H2 
is usually stronger for us out of both the halves and with the festive and the wedding season, I 
think we have guided for about INR 700 crores topline for the whole year and INR 45 crores 
bottom line. And we have already done INR 26 crores in the first half. So, even if we just match 
that, I am pretty sure you will beat your own guidance. So, do you want to update that or do you 
want to stick to the INR 45 crores PAT and INR 700 crores topline? 
Harit Zaveri: So, I actually see, what we are right now seeing is more and more corporates are going towards 
this gold metal loan. So, when they are going to gold metal loan, the emphasis are coming in job 
work. So, right now, let us say, last quarter Y-on-Y basis, Quarter 2, we have done 163 kg of job 
work versus this year we have done 249 kg of job work. So, there is a very high steep increase 
in job work. Now, our consumers, those who are corporates basically have GML facilities and 
they want to do work with us on job work model. And we are also preferring those model because 
we get the gold prior to the dispatchment. So, in this case, if you see the topline might get shifted, 
but the volumes will support it. Let us say if I am not doing 700 topline, but that let us say 10 kg 
of order which has come has not come on the sale basis. It has come on the job work basis. My 
profitability would still remain same, but my topline would shift. That way, if you see the topline 
has only grown about 25%, but overall the volumes are flat.  So, the company has grown on an 
ideal way, about 50%. So, with that keeping in mind, bottom line at INR 45 crores, I think now 
it is as you already on TTM level, it is INR 47 crores. The environment is quite dynamic. Let us 
not revise it. Let us understand Quarter 3, how is it rolling out?  It is pretty good, actually, in 
terms of retail , it is going very strong. So, let us hold on to the next quarter until any other 
revisions. It will be too early to revise anything. 
Sahil Patani: Yes, that is fine. So, just one last question how was the Diwali and the whole festive period for 
you? And I know that we have like 4 stores that we are trying to open over the next couple of 
J EWELLERS LTD 
 RBZ Jewellers Limited 
November 12, 2025 
 
 Page 6 of 20 
years. Any update on that? I know one of them is supposed to come in Q4 itself. So, if you could 
just provide an update on that and how was the whole festive period for you? 
Harit Zaveri: Yes. So, if you talk about festives, Navratri was early, like it was seen Quarter 2 this year, the 
start of Navratri. And it was a good festival season.  In retail, we saw a very strong ticket size 
upgradation. And there were customers coming in and despite the gold prices moving this high. 
So, we are able to, I think, Quarter 3 when the results will come out, you will really see that the 
retail has done fairly a good job because Quarter 2 is dominated by job work that is on the B2B 
segment. But Quarter 3  will really have, I think retail is doing fairly well . To answer your 
question, festive season has really gone good. We have seen a strong growth despite having only 
one single store. And because of the strength that the store has really done well, we are so 
confident to develop another coming couple of stores and then adding up 2 more. So, festivals 
have gone good and the coming storerooms of 4 stores, the one is in Ra jkot, Surat and then 
another 2  stores are in Pipeline. We are understanding what kind of thing, but the overall 
intention would be to really become a good player on a retail front in Gujarat. So, can we really 
go forward for further strong expansion of stores? And in terms of Rajkot and Surat, those stores 
are one of the largest in the respective cities. So, 10,000 square feet carpet area each, that is 
minimum. Rajkot might be a little bit larger.  So, I think we are aggressive in terms of store 
expansion and the Ahmedabad store is showing us that that reflections that it is growing despite 
having the same store, high numbers, we are able to grow it X, Y, Z%. So, it is showing us that 
confidence. 
Sahil Patani: Got it. Ye s, surely. And thanks for that, Harit.  And again, congratulations on a strong set of 
numbers. And hopefully, we continue the strength for the remainder of the year as well. 
Harit Zaveri: Sure, sir. Thanks a lot. 
Moderator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of D eepesh Sancheti from Mania Finance. 
Please go ahead. 
Deepesh Sancheti: Hi Harit, congratulations on a great set of numbers. My first question was regarding the number 
of showrooms. Now you mentioned that you are opening 4 showrooms. You already mentioned 
three names that is Rajkot, Baroda and Surat. What is the fourth location? 
Harit Zaveri: So, Rajkot and Surat is finalized. Baroda being a major economy, we are surely wanting to open 
that. We are looking for locations.  But on a broader guideline, we want to , see, there are many 
places in Gujarat, right? So, we might be looking to add a couple  of stores in Ahmedabad also 
or nearby Ahmedabad or basically North Gujarat.  But certainly, we are looking at some spots 
and we are keen to finalize it once at least in the next quarter or so. So, I think when the overall 
guidelines are to become one of the strongest pair in Gujarat in retail, I think 4 is a quite a 
conservative number itself. Pardon me for not telling the location, but you can expect expansion. 
J EWELLERS LTD 
 RBZ Jewellers Limited 
November 12, 2025 
 
 Page 7 of 20 
Deepesh Sancheti: Right. And then just wanted to understand, how do you decide on these locations? Because point 
is, I know that these cities are well known cities. I don't know about Gandhinagar, whether you 
are planning or not. But how do you decide on the locations of this? Whether you look at the 
high income group or how do you actually decide on these locations? 
Harit Zaveri: So, jewellery industry is highly fragmented and th e first thing that we look on to deciding 
location is demographics, the community sense. So, let us say in Gujarat, in Ahmedabad, we are 
having a strong customer base of certain communities, be it Patel or Jains or Marwaris.  So, our 
stock or the merchandise is famous in those communities. And when we understand that we are 
basically a little premium because of the occasion wear segment and the antique jewellery, we 
are positioned a little premium. So, particularly in those segments, we are finding that, yes, Surat 
and Rajkot or Baroda have the same demographics and the income levels, so on and so forth.  
But we will look at many of the aspects, right?  Certainly a right location will be the thing. The 
community will be the thing.  We cannot open, let  us say tomorrow, a showroom in which we 
are unknown, let us say a Marathi community or any other community wherein we don't have 
an experience. So, the start would be to do an exhibition at a particular location to understand 
from different stakeholders, from the co nsumer, from the vendors, that what kind of products 
are getting served. So, it i s a very conscious call.  So, before freezing any location, a lot of 
exhibitions has already been there. Like Rajkot and Surat, we have done exhibitions throughout. 
There are many customers who are coming from here. Via Instagram and digital marketing, we 
understand that what kind of followers in percentage are there in Surat and Rajkot. So, when we 
tap in there, because these are good bets, so we would want to always receive a warm response. 
And also we understand about the province, like Rajkot is a great place to go because you cover 
the whole Saurashtra side of the Gujarat. And Surat is wonderful because it  is the ninth largest 
in terms of GDP. And also it covers fa ntastically, it covers Southern Gujarat.  So, we look at 
quite a lot of things, demographics too quite simply stated. 
Deepesh Sancheti: What I meant was that going into Rajkot, how do we decide the place? Like, do you go to, like, 
if you are setting up somewhere in Mumbai, you could do it somewhere near the Zaveri Bazaar 
or similar to that, do you think in a particular city or you look at the different location only? 
Harit Zaveri: We would look at hubs. So, wherever the strongest hub is in the jewel lery market, we would 
want to get the place only on that location. So, we are very stringent when it comes to the store 
location. In Rajkot, let us say the store is in the Kalavad road. If it is Surat, it has to be the Parle 
Point or the Ghod Dod road. So, we are very stringent about the location. We do not want to go 
and try ourselves out of the jewellery cluster with any. There is no risk. The location has to be 
100% intact and right. So, no going away from the marketplace, even to spread the stores, etc. 
Deepesh Sancheti: So, these stores will be on lease format or will you purchase these stores, the real estate? 
J EWELLERS LTD 
 RBZ Jewellers Limited 
November 12, 2025 
 
 Page 8 of 20 
Harit Zaveri: Generally, we prefer lease. If we see that there  is an exciting location and the landlord is 
somewhere not agreeing for lease and etc., then we might go for purchase. So, in Surat, half of 
the property is purchased and half of the property is leased. But in Rajkot, it is fully leased. 
Deepesh Sancheti: Great. Just wanted to understand now, we had a sanction limit of around INR 150 crores. And 
how much have we utilized that? And have we utilized it for purchase of gold? And if yes, then 
what is the average price of purchase? 
Harit Zaveri: So, working capital limits will be only utilized for working capital purposes. And CC limits, if 
you see, it will be utilized for working capital purposes only. And primarily it will be through 
for the buying of gold. So, we have utilized around, I am not through with the data, but most of 
the limits are utilized for gold only. 
Deepesh Sancheti: I am not saying for the general, like when you sell gold and you purchase it on one hand, not for 
that. I am talking about your own stock. Have you increased the amount of stock also during this 
entire H1? 
Harit Zaveri: Yes, because the demand was very strong, right? So, if you see the volumes are still flat, so we 
have the purchase and sale will be done throughout. So, yes, we would be utilizing that stock.  
And it was a season period. In fact, for retail right now also, it  is a high on peak season period. 
Wedding seasons are on. So, we would be utilizing it for stocks and yes, we have utilized those 
limits for inventory purposes. 
Deepesh Sancheti: I remember we have been speaking to you since IPO times. And in IPO also, you said that the 
entire money which I am taking, I am going to build my stock with it. At that time, I think at 
that time, there were around INR 60,000 per 10 grams.  That was the rate. And we all were 
surprised that you are putting everything and not trying to go for gold loan. Of course, it turned 
out to be right decision for you. So, just wanted to understand, even now you are putting at the 
same thing or you are also going for gold metal loan? 
Harit Zaveri: So, Deepesh Bhai, it is not like, see, I will tell you that at that point of time, I have said that, INR 
60,000 I am buying gold. But it is not about that. See, when we have demand, we generally buy 
gold. And whenever we sell, we generally replenish it by the gold thing. I would not go for, let  
us say, the INR thing or the GML is just because of let us say the gold has shot up from 60,000 
to 1 lakh. So, we will have to pay the margins, right, for using this hedging tools and all.  And 
we cannot get the margins so much instantly. So, keeping the cash reserves and everything in 
place is like on the seasonal times, it is quite like right now, we are not able to do. And we are 
also not saving on the interest rate.  So, CC, we are paying, let  us say, 9%. On the GML, we 
could have got it by 3%. But I think that is a decision to take, whether we go on GML or on the 
gold buying. But certainly, right now, when you see the results, the strongest progress that you 
can see is that we have not lost on volumes in the first half of the season. And in the Quarter 2, 
we have grown the volumes to 380 kg from 317 kg. So, 20% is the volume rise that has happened 
J EWELLERS LTD 
 RBZ Jewellers Limited 
November 12, 2025 
 
 Page 9 of 20 
in Quarter 2 that really speaks about the robustness of the company rather than anything, which 
is to do with price gains, and etc.  Going forward, we are still understanding and looking at the 
GML part or the hedging part very strongly.  We really don't want any downside risk. And the 
book value of gold is sufficiently and very nicely in place to remove us from any of the downside 
of metal prices that can happen. So, we are quite cautiously covered, Deepesh bhai. 
Deepesh Sancheti: Just coming on the volumes, you said that you have done 380 kg versus 317. This is quarter-on-
quarter or year-on-year? 
Harit Zaveri: Y-on-Y. 
Deepesh Sancheti: Y-on-Y and how much of this has been job work and how much has been from corporates? 
Harit Zaveri: So, 250kgs ideally is through job work in among 380 kgs. And the bifurcation of corporates will 
be quite difficult because I am not having in hand, but most of the people are right now preferring 
to do job work with us. There is a preference change a little, maybe because some of them are 
worried, the rate is 1,25,000. So, let us give GML rather than buying and selling. So, that is why 
maybe the preference changes happen. Similarly, the same changes happen in retail also. People 
are selling, exchanging gold instead of buying fresh, like more freshness. It is  industry-wide 
same, it might reverse. So, but the bifurcation of family versus corporate, I  am not having, but 
we are really focused on corporates, right?  That is how the company is also aligned. And they 
have given us good growth. We are certainly happy that they have prepared for the season and 
the numbers are also showing quite nice. 
Deepesh Sancheti: So, going forward, we as an analyst should not look at your sales growth numbers, but we should 
only look at the volumes as well as your bottom line. Is that would be the right way to judge the 
company? 
Harit Zaveri: No, incorrect, Deepesh bhai. I would add to this like I cannot say incorrect, but partially correct. 
So, the best way to look at a company is, first, look at the volume numbers, multiply it by the 
weighted average gold price,  and you can look at the company from that set.  So, now, when I 
say that this quarter, I have done 380 kgs of volume , ideally, you should multiply that whole 
thing by the weighted average volume that let us say 1,10,000 is the weighted average, if 125 is 
the current rate. And then see that, look at this much amount of business that the company has 
done and then the bottom line about, let us say, INR 18.5 crores, whatsoever. Then you can come 
at the relatable figures. Otherwise, you will always be jumping. If the job work does well, then 
EBITDA will shoot up, PAT will shoot up, but it is not like that. If you look at multiply it by the 
weighted average, things will become easy. Yes, you can look at the sales figu re also. In retail, 
sales figure will be very critical because when I say that multiple locations will ha ppen, so 
revenue will 100% grow, w hy? Because the retail expansion will happen. So, sales will be 
important, but volume figures cannot be not considered. And whenever the job work figures will 
be high, the margins will rise up.

Deepesh Sancheti: No, I am not ignoring the volume figures. In fact, the volume figures are very important. I was 
just trying to ignore the value figures, whether it should be taken. But I think it is a fair point for 
multiplying it and then getting the whole margin scenario also very easy. If you can add this to 
your slide also, I think it would be great because for us also to get the weighted average, of 
course, it is easy, but not a problem. But we will definitely do this if you can give us the volume 
numbers every quarter. Great. Just wanted to understand one more thing as a business point of 
view. Do you think that when you are growing number of stores and maybe will you go for more 
stores in Ahmedabad?  Because just like what Titan is doing in a bigger city, you have more 
number of stores. Will you go that way? And if yes, then when the major expansion of stores 
will be coming, will that be in your own gold only?  Or you will actually come to GML for the 
retail business? 
Harit Zaveri: So, see, as far as we are comfortable with the book value of gold and the weighted average price 
of gold, we will be comfortable in accumulating gold. But once we come with the market parity 
or let us say 10% near to that, that time we will be surely hedging and going forward for certain 
portion of GML exposure also, why not? And on the future level or long term level, 100 % the 
company would be going on, we would be wanting to go on a GML basis. The preference would 
be there, but the change will be gradual and like it has to be quite monitored also. And when you 
say about the store expansions, like how any of the major corporates will be doing, everyone 
will be having their different strategy. And the first thing has to be looked at, not the competitors 
or the peers, but the consumers. Now, consumers will tell the story. If the consumers are coming 
from, let us say, another region, and we are not able to map that and we are going on to a different 
region for building stores, that might be sad , just because the competitors ar e doing it. So, we 
want to focus, everything has to be focused in terms of where the consumer preferences  and 
which locations the consumer are coming? What is the prefe rence that consumers are having? 
And according to that, we will be opening stores. So, let us say, if consumers are coming from 
Tier-3, then why not Tier-3? If consumers are coming from Tier-2, why not Tier-2? And yes, 
then if consumers are coming from the metro cities, for sure. But focus will be not about, okay 
he has opened here but the focus will b e where our consumers are coming from, which 
community they are coming from, the whole detailed study of demographics and their behavior, 
etc. 
Deepesh Sancheti: Why I had to ask this question is because many of the family jewel lers, when you see the way 
they work, they work mainly in one city where the family actually comes from, like even a PNG 
or even Anka Jewel lers, they actually are there, but their presence is in majorly in Pune. Of 
course, PNG is now expanded a lot. But so does Harit Zaveri also want to do this or you want to 
become a pan-Gujarat player? 
Harit Zaveri: So, Deepesh, I am 36 years old. My jewellery store is merely 11 years old. I t was a pilot tested 
store. I can assure you, in 2019, we had a retail revenue of INR 24 crores and right now, last 
year we were at INR 323 crores. Nothing to do with family store. We have no bargain system.  
Things are systematized in the store. No one can come and say that, discount is there and I know 
J EWELLERS LTD

Harit Bhai or something like that nothing. We are purely running this retail store on the basis of 
right marketing that we are doing. You can check our Instagram page, Harit Zaveri Jewel lers. 
You will understand and you can surely come to the store, feel it itself that whether it  is run by 
mainly the relationships or actually driven by products and right kind of policies and procedures. 
Yes, I think this is my submission. 
Deepesh Sancheti: Yes, great, says it all. But again, just one more thing that if the retail presence is going to be, you 
are a 36-year-old guy. So, point is, your focus will be on retail or your focus will be on B2B? 
Where is Harit Zaveri's focus? 
Harit Zaveri: So, volume-wise, we will also see, right now we are having a manufacturing facility and we are 
for sure serving corporates who are giving us the right amount of right volumes. We are goodly, 
fairly focused in manufacturing and the margins are coming from retail and the scalability should 
come from retail. So, we are focusing on enlarging the brand.  For the coming medium -term 
goals, we can surely say that you will see the similar kind of numbers coming in with respect to 
volumes and the volume of retail and whol esale will be somewhere around 50 %-50% in the 
medium-term level. Right now, if you see the volumes are 30% and 70%, 70% of the B2B level. 
So, yes, we are growing B2C, but that does not mean that we are anyways compromising on 
B2B or we are not growing on B 2B also, like there is a lesser growth or anything is there.  No, 
because see, the main reason is B2C is run by, let  us say, Ahmedabad market. If I  am 
understanding Ahmedabad market, let  us say, I will understand in terms of rupees. Let  us say, 
my store has  a maturity level of INR 500 crores.  On that same side, technically understand 
having a manufacturing facility and having, let us say, 10 Karigars, each karigarhaving 1 kg of 
capacity. My manufacturing capacity 3 years ago, if I had 10 kilos, so that will translate to INR 
50,000 per 10 grams, that is INR 50 crore of manufacturing capability I had with 10 Karigars. 
Now, that same 10 Karigarswill not produce less because the gold prices has gone up. They will 
produce the same amount. Right now, my manufacturing capability would be INR 125 crores, 
given that it is INR 1.25 lakh. There is a strong focus in B2B, and we are growing, expanding in 
B2C. But in medium term, you will see the revenue shift will  happen in retail much strongly. 
Volume will remain in both. 
Deepesh Sancheti: Just last question, if I can ask, if I can just squeeze in a last question.  What is the order book as 
of now? Because you had said that in IIGS, you were booked till Diwali. What is the order book 
right now? And what is it in terms of caratage? Do people prefer 18 carat or we have gone lower 
also? That is it. That is the last question? 
Harit Zaveri: Yes, so caratage -wise, we are experimenting in 18 carats. We are building up inve ntory in 
occasion where also 18 carat, that is new for us also. But we are certainly seeing the demand 
coming up. As far as order books, see, job work has done its job in the Quarter 2 itself, we cannot 
expect the same thing to roll out in Quarter 3 because the season was early this year. So, the 
demand has come out early. And the Quarter 3 for job work will be quite muted. But you should 
check it on the year-on-year. We are still on a very good side when it comes to job work. On the 
J EWELLERS LTD

retail level, it is qui te, seeing the 41 days of retail, it is going very good. And we are sure that 
until and unless something else happens, we are sure that the momentum is going to go. Quarter 
3 will be good in terms of strong retail sales, I think we are going to have. So, yes, caratage and 
both, I think the revenue part, I think I hopefully have answered. 
Moderator: Thank you very much. The next question comes from the line of Raj Shah from RK Family 
Office. Please go ahead. 
Raj Shah: Sir,. my first question is, on year-on-year basis, there is solid revenue growth in wholesale 
division. But I think with the lowest volume. So, can we say that this year, we will close below 
200 kg of volume in wholesale division? Of course, gold prices have r aised. But on volume 
figures, I just like your view that we will be closing below 200 kg because 200 kg will be the 
lowest in past 3 years. Similar to that, 19% EBITDA margin on company level, is it majorly due 
to wholesale division driven by gold prices or any other factor is that? 
Harit Zaveri: Raj, certainly, we had a good conversation with D eepesh bhai. But we will take your question. 
So, coming to the point, kindly see wholesale plus job work when you see volume data.  Why? 
Because a customer, which is for me, which can be a corporate or an independent retailer, can 
ask me to supply goods based on wholesale that is a sale bill. Or he can tell me that, I am 
providing you gold a little extra for the day, then you can job work and bill it to me.  So, if you 
see the volume data, you can see that the customer preference can change. We are not sure that 
in Quarter 2, we expected the wholesale to actually grow very strongly. But because of the 
preference, in giving the gold early was there, because of the price rise, they did not want to take 
the risk to actually have a purchase in whatever financials.  So, maybe with that kind of thing, 
looking at job work plus wholesale will be a right kind of a meaningful thing. And if you want 
simple data, in this quarter, wholesale was, let us say, 51.5 kgs, and job work was 249.254. So, 
around 300 kgs of B2B was there, which is in last year 163 plus 57. So, last year volume was 
220 kgs.  So, we don't know if the customer preference changes from job work again to 
wholesale, we might have to give them a sale bill. Otherwise, they are happy to go for job work. 
This is quite dynamic in nature. Second point about margins, margins are clearly dictated by the 
rise in job work volume. So, right now in my sales mix, if you check Quarter 2, 65% is job work. 
So, total 380 kg volume, simple calculation 250 divided by 380, 65.7% is job work. If job work 
is this high in the sales mix, margins are bound to rise. In Quarter 1, if you see it is 87 divided 
by 162, it is only 54%. So, from 54% sale mix, it is 65%-66% of sales mix. Margins are bound 
to rise when the job work is high. 
Raj Shah: But sir, like on year-on-year basis, there is only INR 5 crores of difference. Like in Quarter 2 
FY '25, we did INR 23 crores in job work and this quarter we did INR 28 crores in job work. So, 
INR 5 crores difference in revenue term and you are telling me that INR 19 crores PAT we have 
reported in quarterly number.

Harit Zaveri: So, I will tell you. So, when you look at job work basis, the revenue of job work that is the sale 
of services is one part that is just a billing of stones and etc., things, other materials. But we also 
earn from the salvages that the wastage part of job work. So, let us say if there is a 100 gram set, 
where the stones  are worth INR 10,000 only. So, INR 10,000 in my revenue, the revenue of 
stones will come in the sale of services. But major revenue or major thing will be out of 100 
grams of gold, what amount of wastage that has been given to us, we are saving that wastage. 
So, our recovery or the manufacturing capability to recover gold is very efficient. If the 
efficiency is good there, then we will be able to save on the wastages part. And those wastages 
part will be added directly on the bottom line, basically on the closing inventory. So, that is why 
job work is a very critical data to see and not just the sale of services in terms of rupees. Kindly 
gauge quantity of job work. 
Moderator: Mr. Raj  Shah, sorry to interrupt. Can you please rejoin the question queue f or follow up 
questions? Our next question comes from the line of Chandan Mishra from Finvestors. Please 
go ahead. 
Chandan Mishra: Good evening, sir. First of all, congratulations for the great numbers. Sir, my question is related 
to margin.  I see we have v ariation in margins across quarters in EBITDA as well as P AT 
margins. My question is what sustainable margin we are targeting for? 
Harit Zaveri: Sir, if you want to understand or if you want to understand the relatability of margins, the 
simplest method would be you multiply volumes with the weighted average amount of gold. Let 
us say if I am telling that 380 kg is my volume done, you multiply that with 1,10,000, let us say 
an average rate or 1,10,000,00 as a rupee value. So, INR 418 crores of topline you can take and 
then you can understand the bottom line. It will be equal throughout all the quarters. Now, to get 
back what will be the sustainable margin level in terms of revenue mix, only the revenue part, it 
will fluctuate basis on the job work proportion that we do on the year-on-year basis. If you check 
the full year basis, generally it will be more or less same with any of the previous years.  But if 
you check on the quarterly basis, Quarter 2, if the seasons are early,  margins are going to be 
heavy because job work will be more. Quarter 3 will be dominated by retail, margins are going 
to be a little lesser. 
Chandan Mishra: Sir, my next question is related to how much is inventory gain for this quarter? 
Harit Zaveri: So, inventory gain in this quarter, I have, what do you mean by inventory gain? 
Chandan Mishra: We have inventory hold in last quarter. 
Harit Zaveri: Correct, so you are telling what is the profit that we have made from the increase in price of 
gold, right? 
Chandan Mishra: Yes, definitely sir.

Harit Zaveri: I can tell you, not significant. Though I don't have the numbers handy right now, not significant. 
The company's performance in this quarter is highly driven by the volume that they have 
produced. We have really grown on this Quarter 20% by volumes, despite prices of gold rising 
50%. So, you can understand if the price of gold has risen that much and we have still grown 
beyond that 20% by volumes in Quarter 2, the robustness of the company's performance is right 
now getting shown. Less it is to do with increase in price of gold, it is not a significant portion. 
Moderator: Mr. Chandan Mishra, requesting you to rejoin the question queue for follow -up questions. The 
next question comes from the line of Rajender Passi from NP Analysts. Please go ahead. 
Rajender Passi: Firstly, congratulations on a great set of numbers. My first question would be like, we are going 
to open two stores, one in Q4 FY '26 and the other one would be in Q1 FY '27. Is that the correct 
timeline? 
Harit Zaveri: Yes, it is more or less the correct timeline, yes. 
Rajender Passi: So, regarding this, have we finalized the locations like in Surat as well as in Rajkot? 
Harit Zaveri: The locations are finalized, the lease deed has been done. 
Rajender Passi: And when can we expect this store to be fully operationalized within Q4? Will it be somewhere 
in the mid or at the end of Q4? But our internal target for that? 
Harit Zaveri: It will be late Q4. 
Moderator: Mr. Rajender Passi, requesting you to rejoin the question queue for follow -up questions. Next 
question comes from the line of Kunal Sharma from Veritas. Please go ahead. 
Kunal Sharma: Yes, hi Hari t. So, Harit, on the question on retail store sites, Surat and Rajkot that we have 
anyways identified. So, wanted to understand the strategy behind the Surat store wherein the 
major players like Indriya and many more stores are there. So, what is your take on the marketing 
strategy side? And how are you getting the market share in the Surat as a whole market? 
Harit Zaveri: So, first, the merchandise is correct. Second, the sensing of the demographics is correct. We are 
into Ahmedabad. It is the seventh largest city in terms of GDP. We are into demographics of 
Patel. Surat is in also the same demographics.  The market intelligence that we gather, the kind 
of exhibitions that we do, already the customers of Surat coming into Ahm edabad purchasing 
from us, basically gives us the confidence to develop a store in retail. Now, if you talk about 
whether Indriya, etc., corporates are there, they are there. Will it hamper us?  They are already 
there in Ahmedabad also. Why it has not hampe red us? We are still growing in Ahmedabad 
fairly well. We are not a retailer which has been into legacy period, like 50 years, 70 years into 
the business. We are just new. Like it  has been 10-11 years and we have performed from INR 
J EWELLERS LTD 
 RBZ Jewellers Limited 
November 12, 2025 
 
 Page 15 of 20 
24 crores to INR 323 crores without giving with policies, procedures and on the best of merits.  
So, why not have the confidence to actually scale? 
Kunal Sharma: No. That is correct. But the question on the market share side and the marketing strategy.  So, 
are we doing any marketing campaign over there? 
Harit Zaveri: Certainly, I think that plans will be 100% there and it will be shown. It will be very evident. 
Kunal Sharma: And what is the marketing as a percentage of sales as of today? 
Harit Zaveri: So, generally the marketing budget would be in the new store expansion, it will be somewhere 
around 2%-3%. On the maturity of the store, it will be generally from 0.75%-1%. 
Kunal Sharma: And the last one on the payback side. So, what, like in these two stores,  what would be the 
payback and the breakeven can we expect from these 2 stores? 
Harit Zaveri: Payback and the breakeven, I think, I have told you about, if you can understand the forecasting 
of revenue that we have done for the next year, we have already included the revenue of these 2 
stores with that. And if you understand the marketing expenditure, I have told you that 2%-3%, 
it generally speaks about the kind of revenue and the subtraction of the marketing expenses that 
will happen. So, I think the matc h will be there.  Plus my forecasting of numbers, it will be 
generally in align with that. So, even in the quarter 4 the store is coming, we have generally 
understood the marketing budget for that coming store. And that is how it has been pipelined.  
So, we are in the Surat and Rajkot, we are majorly expecting that the maturity of the store will 
be around INR 500 and INR 400 crores respectively. But the maturity will come in the 4th or 
5th year. So, in the first, second year, it will be generally, let us understand even we are, but on 
the double digit, triple digit, higher double digit or triple digit side of numbers will be there in 
terms of revenue. 
Moderator: Thank you, Mr. Kunal, requesting you to rejoin the question queue for follow ups. The n ext 
follow up question comes from the line of Raj Shah from RK Family Office. Please go ahead. 
Raj Shah: Yes, sir. You have told that my PAT number is higher because of higher job work services. Like 
we have saved gold during job work services.  So, if I see the revenue and volume terms, in 
volume terms, I think we are also flat on H1 basis in job work and in revenue terms, there is not 
a significant growth. So, can we say that because we have done the same volume last year, but 
prices are different of gold and that is why margin has increased drastically? 
Harit Zaveri: No, Raj . Let us clearly understand simple, we will talk 250 kg is my job work volume this 
quarter. Last year quarter, it was 163 kg. So, now 250 kg into sales figure, that is 250 into, let us 
say, 1,10,000. So, job work volume is, in the job work, the amount of goods delivered is, let  us 
say, INR 275 crores. How I have got it? 250 into 110, that is 1,10,000, the gold rate per 10 grams. 
So, last year it was, let  us say, 163 kgs. So, 163 into last year average, it was 75,000, INR 75 
J EWELLERS LTD 
 RBZ Jewellers Limited 
November 12, 2025 
 
 Page 16 of 20 
lakh per kilo. So, it is INR 122 crores. So, from INR 122 crores, we have moved to INR 275 
crores. Now, if you tell that it is because of gold price rise that you have got this, no. Retailers 
already adjust their gold price rise and then they give demand. That does not mean that we have, 
for example, if the gold price is 2 lakhs, then we will be able to keep the volume the same. It is 
never like that. It is based on the designs or the manufa cturing capability that we have, w e are 
able to garner higher amount of volumes or we are able to at least maintain volume flat despite 
prices growing 50%. So, understand, if I have a retail store, my retail store is increasing, let  us 
say, at the pace of 20%-25%, still, my volume will be de-growing at 15%-20%. And in the same 
way, my merchandise will follow. So, it is clearly , you need to check the numbers which 
multiplied by the weighted average and you will come to know the demand of the company in 
that case. 
Raj Shah: Very clear, sir. So, sir, can you quantify that on INR 28 crores, how much we have saved? Like 
how much crores gotten into bottom line just by doing INR 28 crores of job work services? How 
much more we have saved in the saved gold, which I have saved? 
Harit Zaveri: So, generally in job work, we generally assume that at least we should be able to save at least a 
minimum of 2% or 3% or maybe a little bit on the higher side, sometimes on the lower side, 
depends on the recovery complexity of designs, etc.  Numbers are not that handy. You cannot 
take it like extremely on that level, but general notations will be that. 
Raj Shah: So, you are saying 2%-3% of 250 kgs? 
Harit Zaveri: Yes. 
Raj Shah: Understood. And sir, my second question is, like we have seen over the years, our retail business 
has been structurally growing. Last year, despite price rise, our volume growth was pretty solid. 
But I think, so what is your expectation for H2? And because H1 volume growth, lik e H1 has 
not seen volume growth? 
Harit Zaveri: Correct. Perfectly said. So, what we have done, we took a little bit on, we lifted the making 
charge a little bit up. We checked the consumer response. The consumer response was good in 
terms of revenue, but they were still hesitant for purchasing m ore. We were checking the price 
sensitivity of consumers, right? So, because of that, the making charge was a little bit increased, 
but now understanding that the demand is whatever shift the taste preferences, the price 
sensitivity, we have redone that ma king charge. And again, the demand float is strongly there. 
On the complete financial year, retail is going to be very strong.  Quarter 3 will dictate retail. 
There is nothing, I know Quarter 3 will tell most of the stories of retail. And I think we will be  
able to touch, if last year it was INR 323 crores, we should be able to touch good double digit 
growth, plus double digit growth in fact, in retail this year also.

Raj Shah: And sir, you have said that after 4 showrooms coming in, we target to a 50 %-50% share of 
volume in B2B and B2C. So, sir, I think then volume of 600-700 kg in retail will be massive for 
our P&L, right? So, what is your view on that? 
Harit Zaveri: It will be good. But store expansions will also cost marketing. We have marketing cost also. So, 
we need to separate that. On the overall basis, the company will be 100% in the path of 
expansion. As we have said, we are going to become one of the, want to become one of the 
largest player in Gujarat for retail.  I think so far that whatever is necessary will be done, be it 
brand, be it marketing, store built up and yes, there will be revenue maximization. 
Raj Shah: And sir, what kind of operating leverage does our retail business enjoy? Like in our current store, 
how much more margin can increase as turnover increases? 
Harit Zaveri: So, it depends on the product mix. If diamonds are doing good, then the margins can increase. 
Certainly in our case, if occasion jewellery is doing good, margins are always good because we 
are also the manufacturer of occasion wear jewellery. So, that is where the actual play comes in. 
We can sell at a lesser cost than market and still gear up more margin than any of our peers, just 
because we are the original source manufacturer of those products. So, integrated manufacturing 
capabilities helps us in gearing up the margins in retail. Also the design exclusivity has also been 
maintained in that case. So, that is actually the USP of very strong selling proposition or design 
exclusivity, but and also cost leadership. So, going forward, if the occasion where demand is 
there, surely the margin will sustain in retail. 
Raj Shah: Sir, can you bifurcate like how much EBITDA margins does our retail operations make? 
Harit Zaveri: Product mix margin bifurcation, I don't have. 
Raj Shah: No, not product mix, retail division. 
Harit Zaveri: Not handy as of now, but let me see. But not handy. 
Raj Shah: If 19% is our quarterly EBITDA margin, then like if you can get how much comes from retail? 
Moderator: Mr. Raj Shah, I am extremely sorry to interrupt. Can you please rejoin the question queue for 
follow up questions? The next follow up question comes from the line of Chandan Mishra from 
Finvestors. Please go ahead. 
Chandan Mishra: Thank you, sir  for the follow up question.  Sir, my question is related to seeing the price 
fluctuation of gold on the downside in Q3, what can we achieve from division, sir? 
Harit Zaveri: So, seeing the downside price in Q3, the gold price shooting up and correcting always as per my 
experience has created a nice spike in retail  for buying. So, this is the moment when the price 
gets corrected after increasing. Retailers, customers come and they want to buy gold or book the 
J EWELLERS LTD 
 RBZ Jewellers Limited 
November 12, 2025 
 
 Page 18 of 20 
gold that they booked the sets that they have selected or make a sale of the selected goods. That 
is what I have seen. Nothing is going to get affected in terms of dropping in gold prices.  The 
book value of gold is safe. And we should enjoy the demand that is coming. When the gold 
prices get corrected once in a while and then again rises. Continuous drop of gold prices makes 
the customer confused and continuous increase of gold prices also makes the customer confused. 
They hold, but because we are in occasion jewelry, delay of demand can be there, denial will 
not be there. 
Chandan Mishra: One last question, sir. You have given guidance for INR 700 crores for revenue and INR 45 
crores of PAT. In H1, we have already achieved almost more than half of guidance of PAT. But 
in a revenue level, we have achieved almost 38 %-40%. Do we achieve on track to achieve the 
revenue guidance? 
Harit Zaveri: Chandan Bhai, it really depends on our retailers who wants to get their goods on the sale bill or 
who wants to do job work services with us. So, let us say, if you are a retailer, you are giving 
me one kg of gold for a job work service, I will make a job work and I will give it to you. But I 
will charge my profits. And if you are wanting to take that on the sale bill side of one kg, I will 
book the sale as, let us say, INR 1.25 crores, and I will give it to you and then you can give me 
the payment. So, it really depends on the consumer, our retailers preferences. The little bit of 
preferences because of sharp increase in gold prices has shifted in more of job work. That is why 
you're not able to  see the reflection of revenue.  Kindly see volume data of B2B combined to 
actually understand the company with whether how it is doing in B2B side and multiply it by 
weighted average price of gold. 
Moderator: Thank you for your answer, sir. The next questi on comes from the line of Rajend er Passi from 
NP Analyst. Please go ahead. 
Rajender Passi: Yes, so as I was continuing that when we are going to open 2 stores, one in Surat and the other 
one in Rajkot, so we will definitely need to increase our inventory size as well, right? And I 
guess the current inventory size is almost at INR 360 Cr. So, how much do we see it to be going 
up and how we are going to fund it like, will it be mainly through debt? 
Harit Zaveri: It will be mainly through debt, through internal accruals and through stock optimization. 
Rajender Passi: And what would be the size of inventory that we are looking at? Right now, it is 360, so where 
it can land? 
Harit Zaveri: So, for competitive purposes, we are generally not wanting to disclose this inventory because it 
will directly be relating to the new stores that is coming up. You will eventually see in the results 
are out and inventory will be actually seen. But  generally, when the debt equity ratio has to go 
on 1:1 level, you can see that what amount of float will be there?  Going forward, what amount

of inventory will be built up? Whatever the debt is to equity ratio one is to one will be there, will 
be generally through working capital limits. 
Rajender Passi: And the second question would be, as we already have a large chunk of our revenues coming in 
from the B2B, are we doing something to increase our customer base on the B2B end, like 
acquiring new customers or something? 
Harit Zaveri: Continuous practice of exhibitions will be there, launching of new designs will be there, 
understanding market dynamics, experimenting in different caratage, like 18 carats and all will 
help us in actually penetrating the market more. It is more of a very organized and systematic 
approach that we do because we are dealing with majorly corporates. Also, one of the only 
wholesalers or manufacturers who is able to demand gold in advance or prior and actually get a 
job work done for that. So, specialization is in place. We are maintaining the design quality, the 
product quality, the specialization. And yes, the penetration is certainly seen. You can see it from 
the results itself that volumes dictates the robustness of it and 50% price correction, still we have 
served by and by an equal volume. Also, it is because of the early season. I agree with that. But 
still, the company has done good when it comes to the first half of the year. And I think we will 
be meeting the expectations also, like the projections that we have set forward. 
Rajender Passi: Yes, that is fine. Basically, the company is doing well and mainly understanding from the future 
perspective that we are also looking at expanding our customer base from the B2B side? 
Harit Zaveri: Yes. Customer base on the B2B side, we will be for surely exploring. We are preferred 
manufacturers, preferred suppliers for many of the corporate clients, and we will continue to do 
that. 
Rajender Passi: And as you know, the Q3 is almost half of it is gone, right? And as you have already said that 
we are seeing strong numbers for strong foothold (unaudible)So, are we confident of beating the 
last year number from that part? 
Harit Zaveri: Market is dynamic and that is far for me to tell. But certainly I can tell that the retail division of 
Q3 is doing strong. And whatever the guidance that we have given , quarter-on-quarter we are 
getting near and we are seeing that we are achieved. Now, it has been almost 6-7 quarters that 
the company is listed. And my PAT guidance and revenue guidance, generally compan y is  
meeting. So, even this year, we are hopeful to meet them. But the environment is quite dynamic 
in nature. The pric es are fluctuating, geopolitical tensions and everything is there. So, there is 
also a little bit of caution which is there.  But certainly with respect to business, we are quite 
positive and the expansion is also going on. The spirit is there. 
Rajender Passi: And the last question would be from the customer demand side. Like, as the prices have risen so 
much, the main trend that I  have seen in the industry is that the customers are looking for the 
lower carat jewellery, like mainly into 18 or maybe even low er than that. So, how do you see

the demand from the customer side? Is it still for the higher carat jewellery or the lower carat 
side? 
Harit Zaveri: See, India is culturally rooted. Occasion jewellery segment is still dominated by 22 carat 
jewellery rathe r than 18 carat jewellery. In daily wear segments, there is a caratage shift.  
Preference of 18 carat or lower caratage is very high. And we are agile to that trend. But in 
occasion wear, still the domination will be of 22 carat.  Yes, there is an entrance. We are also 
entering into 18 carat occasion wear and we are seeing that whatever the pulse of market will 
be, let us understand the pulse and then to gauge the experiment and the initial exercise of going 
into 18 carat is for sure, we will be doing it. 
Rajender Passi: That was all from my end. All the best. 
Harit Zaveri: Thank you. 
Moderator: Thank you. As there are no further questions, I would now like to hand the conference over to 
the management for closing comments.

concall and I hope that I have answered all the questions very clearly and correctly. If you have 
any further questions, you would like to know more about the company, please reach out to the
