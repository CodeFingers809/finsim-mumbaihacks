Ester Strategy for Recycling
Ester has adopted mechanical recycling in its existing operations and chemical  recycling will be adopted by ELITe
Criteria
▪ Feed Stock
▪ Material Quality
▪ Recycling Cycles
▪ Recycling ‘Tough-to-Recycle’ PET 
waste
▪ Extent of circularity
▪ Value for Ester
Mechanical Recycling Chemical Recycling
• PET bottles / Polyester textile / any kind of polyester waste
• Breaks PET down into its original monomers (rDMT & rMEG), 
which are then polymerized to produce virgin quality PET
• In each recycling cycle, polyester waste can be fully 
reconstituted into virgin quality PET, allowing for infinite 
recycling potential
• Recycles tough-to-recycle waste into base monomers which 
can be converted into new textile fibers, promoting T2T 
circularity, potentially reducing the textile waste that is 
currently landfilled
• Suitable for B2B, T2T & F2F. Thus 100% circularity in true sense
is achievable
• Adopted to fulfil the requirement of international brands to 
enable them to meet their sustainability goals
▪ Scrap PET bottles
▪ Multiple cycles of recycling of PET may affect overall
quality parameters
▪ Repeated recycling causing degradation limits the 
number of recycling loops
▪ T2T waste recycling is impossible due to the challenges of
dealing with contamination from dyes, finishes and mixed
fibers. As a result, much of PET textile waste ends up in
landfills
▪ Suitable only for B2B, B2T & B2F
▪ Adopted to produce Films with PCR content and B2B
applications. Focus on domestic market

Shift Towards Sustainable &
PCR content Materials
PWMR* has mandated 10% PCR content in flexible 
packaging. This is pushing brand owners to adopt 
PET Films with PCR content as preferred substate
for Packaging needs
Export Demand
India is a major exporter of polyester films 
to Europe, North America and Southeast 
Asia, benefiting from competitive pricing 
and scale
Booming Flexible Packaging Sector
India's rapid growth in FMCG, food & beverages, 
e-commerce and reduction in GST rates 
continues to boost demand for durable, 
lightweight and printable packaging materials
Industry Scenario
Technological Advancements in Film 
Manufacturing
Development of high-barrier, anti-fog and coated 
films is enabling broader usage across medical, 
industrial, and consumer applications

Chairman’s Comments
“

29
During Q2 FY26, Ester reported consolidated revenue of ₹357 crore, a 7% year-on-year growth, supported by higher volumes across both Polyester Film and
Specialty Polymer segments. Profitability was affected adversely due to softer margins in Polyester Films. On consolidated basis, the Company earned an EBITDA of
₹17 crore (down 59% YoY) and incurred net loss of ₹16 crore, reflecting the ongoing concerns in the Film segment due to pressure on margins in domestic market
caused by imports and in overseas markets due to effect of US Trade Tariff.
Consolidated EBITDA for the quarter would have been ₹28 crores (7.70%) but for adverse impact of exchange fluctuation and MTM losses on FCL / derivatives.
The Specialty Polymer segment continued its strong performance with revenue of ₹57 crore, up 39% YoY, and EBIT of ₹21 crore, up 45% YoY, supported by
sustained demand for its marquee products despite US Trade Tariff. Both volume of sales & margins remained protected due to IP protection.
The Polyester Chips & Film segment, now including rPET, reported a rise in volume of sales in rPET by 219% and in Film by 9%. Ester Filmtech Limited (EFTL), wholly
owned subsidiary, achieved 40% YoY growth in sales volume and 20% growth in revenue. Though the segment recorded a marginal revenue growth of 2%, the Film
SBU witnessed shrinkage in margins due to imports and US Trade Tariff. Basis petition by domestic Polyester Film industry, DGTR has initiated investigation for
imposition of Anti-Dumping Duty (ADD) against imports originating from Bangladesh, China PR, Thailand and USA.
As regard to recycling project being pursued by ELITe, I am glad to inform you that all activities related to completion of the project by December 2027 are being
pursued diligently. ELITe has entered into an agreement with a group of Sellers for acquisition of ~90 acres of project land in the PCPIR zone—strategically located
in Surat, Gujrat providing access to polyester textile waste, skilled workforce, and a deep-water seaport.
I am delighted to inform that multiple international marquee clients have started entering into offtake agreements much before commissioning of the plant which
reinforces the fact there is high demand for products to be offered by ELITe.
A multi-year offtake agreement has been secured with Nike, making it the anchor customer for the Infinite Loop
 India facility. Under this agreement, ELITe will
supply to Nike Twist
 , Loop’s branded virgin-quality polyester resin made exclusively from textile waste, featuring full traceability through Loop’s proprietary
chemical tracer technology.
ELITe will supply recycled polyester intermediates and resins to Taro Plast S.p.A. under a new offtake agreement with loop industries, including 100% recycled
Loop
 DMT for automotive and specialty polymer applications.
A strategic alliance has been formed with Hyosung TNC to convert high-purity, fully traceable Twist
 polyester into premium Regen
 performance yarns for
leading apparel brands.
With growing demand for Polyester Film, IP protection for certain marquee products in Specialty Polymers segment, and focus on products promoting recycling
and sustainability, we are confident to continue creating value for our shareholders. Ester remains focused on strengthening its specialty polymer portfolio,
improving operational efficiency, and advancing its circular economy vision through the ELITe project, positioning the Company for sustainable growth in the years
ahead.
