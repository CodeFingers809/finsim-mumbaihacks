the requirements of Regulation 34 of the SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015 within the period prescribed

the same under "Compliance" head with description "Reg. 34 (1) Annual Report". We hereby further 
submit that, we immediately re-uploaded the Annual Report at the BSE’s listing centre on the same date 
and apologized for the inadvertent clerical error.
