FROM THE CEO’S DESK
Dear Unitholders,
We sincerely thank you for the trust and confidence 
placed in Knowledge Realty Trust. It is a pleasure to 
share our first half-yearly report for FY 2025–26 - an 
important milestone as we begin our journey. We see 
this as the start of a long-term, value-driven 
partnership with our unitholders. In Q2 FY 2025-26, 
we distributed ` 6,900 million, or ` 1.56 per unit 
highlighting our focus on consistent value creation.
REITs in India: A Maturing Asset 
Class
REITs in India have truly come of age – evolving from 
a novel concept to a trusted, mainstream investment 
vehicle. The growing participation from both 
institutional and retail investors is a testament to 
the confidence in the asset class and the underlying 
fundamentals of India’s commercial real estate 
sector. As a product, REITs offer the ideal blend of 
stability and growth – and we believe we are just at the 
beginning of a long-term journey for investors and the 
economy.
The recent SEBI reclassification of REITs from a ‘hybrid’ 
to an ‘equity’ instrument has been a significant driver 
of sectoral inflows, enabling broader participation from 
equity investors and inclusion across a wider spectrum 
of investment mandates. Moreover, REITs have 
historically performed well during rate easing cycles, 
supported by lower financing costs and enhanced 
valuations.
India’s Growth Story: A Strong 
Foundation 
India’s economic momentum continues to inspire 
confidence. Now the world’s fourth-largest economy, 
India is on track to become the third-largest by 2030, 
with GDP projected at US$ 7.3 trillion — a testament to 
sound policy, decisive governance, and growing global 
integration.
Strengthening employment, easing inflation, and 
resilient consumer sentiment are fueling robust 
domestic demand.
In Q1 FY 2025-26, India recorded GDP growth of 
7.8%, the second straight quarter of strong expansion, 
reaffirming its status as the fastest-growing major 
economy. The services sector — the cornerstone of 
modern India — continues to outperform expectations, 
a positive indicator for KRT given our portfolio’s deep 
alignment with India’s services-led growth.
Leadership through Scale and 
Quality
KRT is India’s largest office REIT, with a market 
capitalization of ` 511,641 million as of September 30, 
2025. Our portfolio is concentrated in Bengaluru, 
Mumbai, and Hyderabad — India’s key hubs for 
technology, innovation, and finance — attracting 
long-term corporate investment. We are also 
selectively exploring assets for further expansion in the 
top 6-7 core markets while maintaining disciplined 
capital allocation.
Half Yearly Report FY 2025-268
Relationships – Tenants at the Core
Strong tenant relationships are central to KRT’s 
success. We design offices that not only meet 
operational needs but also foster collaboration, 
innovation, and employee well-being. Amenities, smart 
infrastructure, and sustainability features help us 
attract and retain high-quality tenants, ensuring stable 
occupancy and long-term revenue growth.
Employees – The Core of Every Success
Our people are fundamental to everything we achieve. 
KRT fosters a culture of accountability, curiosity, and 
collaboration, providing employees with opportunities 
to innovate, take ownership, and grow professionally. A 
motivated and engaged workforce drives operational 
excellence, strengthens tenant relationships, and 
supports sustainable portfolio growth.
Looking Ahead: Scaling 
Responsibly
Over the next five years, KRT will strengthen 
its leadership in India’s office market through 
scale, selectivity, and intelligence. We will pursue 
complementary expansion, deepen tenant 
relationships, and integrate technology across 
processes while maintaining financial prudence and 
operational discipline to deliver consistent returns for 
unitholders.
To our unitholders, tenants, and partners — thank you 
for your trust and support.
Shirish Godbole
Chief Executive Officer
Our growth is supported by our 
sponsors – Sattva and Blackstone. 
Sattva contributes development 
experience and local knowledge, 
while Blackstone brings global 
expertise and institutional 
discipline.
Guided by Strategic Priorities
Our strategy is guided by four priorities – Growth, 
Execution, Relationships and Employees – which shape 
how we expand, engage, and create lasting value 
for tenants, partners, and unitholders, forming the 
foundation of KRT’s sustainable growth and leadership 
in India’s office market.
Growth – Expanding with Purpose
Our growth strategy goes beyond increasing square 
footage. It focuses on deepening our presence in 
high-demand markets, maintaining portfolio quality, 
enhancing operational efficiency, and pursuing 
strategic acquisitions and developments. This includes 
leveraging our ROFO pipeline, exploring built-to-suit 
opportunities for marquee tenants, and selectively 
redeveloping older assets to maximise long-term value.
Execution - Operational Excellence
The core to delivering value is to continuously future-
proof our assets to maintain our edge as the premier 
Grade-A office ecosystem. A sharp focus on leasing, 
cost efficiencies, and strategic debt financing will keep 
us ahead of the curve in profitability.

Knowledge Realty Trust 9
Dear Unitholders,
It gives me great pleasure to connect with you for 
the first time after our successful listing. The listing 
was met with overwhelming investor response, with 
the issue being oversubscribed more than twelve 
times, including a record 16x participation from non-
institutional investors. 
India’s office real estate landscape is undergoing 
a deep transformation as it emerges stronger and 
more resilient amid accelerating demand from Global 
Capability Centers (GCCs) and rapidly growing 
domestic corporates. This phase represents a 
structural growth cycle, driven by the country’s robust 
economic fundamentals, an expanding talent pool, 
and government policies fostering ease of doing 
business. India is rapidly establishing itself as a global 
powerhouse for office occupancy—serving not only 
domestic needs but also positioning itself as  
“Office for India” and  “Office for the World.”
At Knowledge Realty Trust, we are proud to lead 
from the front in this dynamic marketplace, offering 
a premier portfolio that is not only geographically 
diverse, spanning six major cities with over 46 msf 
of Grade-A office ecosystems, but also finely tuned 
to meet the evolving demands of occupiers seeking 
quality, sustainability, and innovation.
Leasing Momentum and 
Operational Excellence
During the 9M CY2025, India recorded around 60 msf 
of gross absorption - led by Bengaluru, Hyderabad 
and Mumbai which together accounted for over 55% 
of total leasing activity. With structural demand drivers 
firmly in place and new-age occupiers continuing to 
prefer high-quality, sustainable spaces, the outlook for 
the office sector remains exceptionally robust.
The first half of FY 2025-26 validated our strategic 
focus and portfolio strength. Our gross leasing 
activity reached a robust 1.8 msf, of which 1.2 msf was 
new leasing, complemented by 0.6 msf of renewals. 
Importantly, the average leasing spread of 29% reflects 
not just strong tenant demand but also our ability 
to drive premium rental growth—an indicator of the 
exceptional asset quality and operational excellence 
across our portfolio.
Occupancy growth reflects this leasing momentum, 
rising by 340 basis points year-on-year to 92%. 
Hyderabad stands out with 99% occupancy, 
underscoring its status as one of India’s premier 
GCC hubs, while Mumbai and Bengaluru have both 
seen encouraging occupancy upticks, reaching 88%, 
buoyed by sustained demand from BFSI, technology, 
and infrastructure tenants. Our portfolio’s tenant 
base, diversified across sectors and geographies, 
continues to expand with over 450 high-quality 
tenants demonstrating strong commitment by way of 
lease renewals and expansions. Notably, expansions by 
existing tenants accounted for 57% of new leasing in 
H1 FY 2025-26, emphasizing the stickiness and value 
propositions embedded in our office ecosystems. 
We remain committed to delivering an exceptional 
customer experience that extends beyond our 
corporate tenants to embrace every individual 
occupant across our portfolio as a valued customer.
Growing with Purpose
FROM THE COO’S DESK
KRT, with 
its premier 
portfolio, 
serves as 
‘Office for 
India’ and 
‘Office for 
the World’.
Half Yearly Report FY 2025-2610
Financial Performance and 
Balance Sheet Strength
Knowledge Realty Trust’s financial trajectory mirrors 
our operational success. Revenues for the half year 
ended September 2025 reached ` 22,019 million—
marking a healthy 17% increase from the prior 
year—while Net Operating Income (NOI) posted a 
strong 20% year-on-year growth to ` 19,544 million. 
The resulting NOI margin of 89% is a testament to 
our focus on cost discipline and asset management 
efficiencies.
Capital discipline continues to guide our journey. The 
average cost of debt has been meaningfully reduced 
by 120 bps to 7.4% from 8.6% in March 2025, thanks to 
successful refinancing and tapping lower-cost funding 
avenues. 
Our conservative leverage, reflected in an 18%  
loan-to-value ratio, provides us with financial flexibility 
and provides ample room to fund growth through 
acquisitions.
For the first half of FY 2025-26, 
KRT recorded revenue of 
` 22,019 million and NOI of 
` 19,544 million, reflecting 
year-on-year growth of 17% and 
20% respectively. 
Innovation and Sustainability 
Initiatives
Beyond the physical footprint, innovation is central 
to our value creation. Leveraging cutting-edge 
technology and digital tools, we are enhancing 
building operations to foster efficiency, reduce costs, 
and optimize tenant experiences. 
Over the past six months, we have prioritized 
enhancing the occupier experience through a strategic 
focus on digital transformation and data-driven 
decision-making. A key milestone in this journey 
has been the implementation of Computer-Aided 
Facilities Management (CAFM) across 11 of our assets, 
enabling us to digitize core operational activities 
and transition from reactive to proactive building 
management. Complementing this, we have launched 
the Spark mobile application, designed to further 
elevate the occupier experience by digitizing essential 
services such as access control, food ordering, and 
facility bookings. These initiatives underscore our 
commitment to leveraging technology to optimize 
operational efficiency, improve tenant engagement, 
and strengthen our portfolio’s competitive positioning.
These advancements are complemented by a 
comprehensive sustainability agenda, with 76% of 
our portfolio value green-certified—cementing our 
commitment to environmental stewardship and 
aligning with global ESG best practices. More than 1/3rd 
of our portfolio received a 5-star GRESB rating and 
was ranked 1st amongst its peers in India. Almost 74% 
of our portfolio is powered using renewable energy 
and 5 of our assets received Energy Efficient Unit 
Award in 2025.
Outlook and Commitment
Looking forward, the demand fundamentals for 
Grade-A office space in India remain resilient, with 
occupiers that prioritize high-quality spaces that are 
not only workplaces but offer a holistic environment. 
The embedded mark-to-market rental upside in our 
portfolio stands at 22%, offering meaningful runway 
for organic income growth. Meanwhile, our tenant 
diversification and seasoned leasing team position us 
well to capitalize on unfolding opportunities.
Knowledge Realty Trust remains steadfast in delivering 
superior outcomes for shareholders by balancing 
growth with resilience, innovation with efficiency, and 
operational excellence with financial prudence. As we 
seize the growth momentum that India’s office market 
offers, we are confident in our ability to create long-
term, sustainable value for all stakeholders.

ESG
We aim to act as catalysts of growth for the 
businesses that occupy our spaces and the 
communities around them. Our focus remains on 
creating ‘spaces that speak’ through innovation 
in design and technology, building long-term 
partnerships, enhancing health and well-being, and 
anchoring our efforts in community impact and 
sustainability.
During the year, we reached a key inflection point as 
we deepened our digital transformation through the 
deployment of Computer-Aided Facility Management 
(CAFM) across selected assets. This initiative 
streamlined core processes, automated workflows, 
and strengthened operational agility. We further 
enhanced the occupier experience through the 
Spark App, which enables seamless, contactless, and 
digitally enriched interactions across our campuses.
Our ESG-led strategies continued to advance with 
the deployment of a digital tool across 11 assets to 
measure and report on key environmental and EHS 
compliance metrics. The tool provides comprehensive 
insights that support informed and data-driven 
decisions. We remain positioned among the 
industry’s ESG leaders, with 76% of our portfolio by 
GAV holding green certifications. We also achieved 
a Five-Star rating in the GRESB assessment*, 95/100 
scored and ranked 1st among our peer group in India.

the city has emerged as one of India’s fastest-growing commercial hubs, attracting multinational companies, 
multi-sector Global Capability Centres (GCCs), biotechnology, and pharmaceutical firms. Its growth is 
underpinned by abundant talent, a high standard of living, and comparatively affordable rental costs.
The city’s real estate market has witnessed healthy expansion across commercial, residential, and data 
centre segments. Many prominent multinational and technology companies have also established their 
largest offices in the city, thereby reinforcing the city’s status as one of the leading destinations for IT/ITeS

  For the purpose of this section, details of all 
pending title litigation pertaining to the Portfolio 
Assets and the Portfolio Investment have been 
disclosed. Other than as disclosed below, there 
are no pending title litigations pertaining to the

of September 30, 2025:
A. One International Center and One Unity Center
1   Elphinstone Spinning and Weaving Mills 
Company Limited (the erstwhile owner of the 
land underlying One International Center and One 
Unity Center) and another (“ Petitioners”) have 
ﬁled a writ petition in March 1997 (“Writ Petition”) 
before the High Court of Judicature, at Bombay 
(“Bombay High Court ”) against the Union of 
India and others (“ Respondents”) challenging 
the constitutional validity of the provisions of 
the Textile Undertakings (Nationalization) Act, 
1995 (“ 1995 Act ”) and the subsequent action 
proposed to be taken pursuant thereto by the 
Respondents and 
inter alia seeking (a) restraining 
order against the Union of India and others from 
taking action and/or implementation of the 
Textile Undertakings (Nationalization) Act, 1955 
pertaining to Elphinstone Spinning and Weaving 
Mills Limited’s textile undertaking; (b) restraining 
order against Union of India and others from 
taking steps with regards to the disposal of the 
assets of Elphinstone Spinning and Weaving 
Mills Limited; and (c) directing Union of India 
and others to hand back the possession of 
the textile undertaking and other assets taken 
over by them in the year 1983. Following an 
ordinance promulgated in October, 1983, 13 
mills in Mumbai, Maharashtra, including the mills 
held by the Elphinstone Spinning and Weaving 
Mills Limited (the erstwhile owner of the land 
underlying One International Center and One 
Unity Center) were taken over in the custody of 
the National Textile Corporation Limited and the 
National Textile Corporation (South Maharashtra) 
Limited under the Textile Undertakings (Taking 
Over of Management) Ordinance, 1983 (later 
enacted as Textile Undertakings (Taking Over 
of Management) Act, 1983) (“ 1983 Act”) on the 
grounds of alleged mismanagement of the aﬀairs 
of the mills. Prior to the Writ Petition another 
writ petition was ﬁled in 1983 by the Petitioners 
(“Writ Petition 1 ”) before the Bombay High 
Court challenging the constitutional validity of 
the 1983 Act. By way of its order in June, 1984, 
(“HC Order ”) the Bombay High Court held in 
favor of the Petitioner, declaring the 1983 Act 
unconstitutional in so far as it pertained to 
taking over the Petitioners’ textile undertakings. 
Certain Respondents (Union of India and NTC) 
ﬁled appeals (“ Appeal”) against the HC Order 
before the Supreme Court of India (“ Supreme 
Court”). In January 1985, the Supreme Court 
issued interim orders, staying implementation 
of the 1983 Act in relation to Petitioner’s mills 
and restraining disposal of its assets, until 
further orders. In January, 2001, the Supreme 
Court passed the ﬁnal verdict, overturning the 
HC Order and upholding the validity of the 1983 
Act. While the said appeals were pending before 
the Supreme Court, the 1995 Act purporting to 
nationalize the Petitioner’s textile undertakings 
was passed and replaced the 1983 Act. The 
Petitioners subsequently ﬁled the Writ Petition 
with the Bombay High Court challenging the 
1995 Act on the grounds that the 1995 Act was 
ultra vires the Constitution of India and that the 
1995 Act was a continuation of the 1983 Act 
which, had been declared unconstitutional by the 
Bombay High Court, to the extent it pertained to 
taking over the Petitioner’s textile undertakings. 
However, in October 2001, the Bombay High 
96 Half Yearly Report FY 2025-26
I. Legal and Regulatory Matters
Court adjourned the Writ Petition as a separate 
matter regarding the status of Article 31C of 
the Constitution of India was pending with 
a larger bench of the Supreme Court at the 
time. Meanwhile, in June, 2005, National Textile 
Corporation (South Maharashtra) Limited invited 
bids for the sale of its mill assets, including land 
and structures, through a tender notice pursuant 
to which OICPL has acquired the land. By way 
of Chamber Summons in 2005, Indiabulls Real 
Estate Company Private Limited (now known as 
OICPL was also added as a respondent to the 
Writ Petition. Additionally, a notice of motion 
was ﬁled by petitioners in 2005 to restrain 
the respondents from in any manner selling, 
disposing of, or alienating the disputed land. In 
relation to the notice of motion, an order was 
passed by the Bombay High Court in July 2005 
directing the respondents to not take any ﬁnal 
decision on the bids concerning the mill lands 
as well as the staﬀ quarters. These matters are 
currently pending.
2.  Indian National Trust for Art & Cultural Heritage 
and others have ﬁled a writ petition in the 
nature of public interest litigation in June, 
2005, (“ Petition”) before the High Court of 
Judicature at Bombay (“ Bombay High Court ”) 
against the State of Maharashtra through the 
secretary of Urban Development Department 
and others seeking protection and conservation 
of structures in the mills of Mumbai which have 
great heritage value. Pursuant to the Petition, the 
petitioners have sought certain reliefs 
inter alia 
(i) issuance of a writ of mandamus or any other 
writ, order or direction directing the respondents 
to ensure that no permission for development/
redevelopment for any of the disputed structures 
be granted, or if already granted, is further acted 
upon, except in accordance with the said listing 
read with Regulation 67 of the Development 
Control Regulations for Greater Mumbai 1991 
(“D.C. Regulations”); (ii) issuance of directions to 
the respondents to complete the comprehensive 
listing of mill structures with heritage value 
presently in progress; (iii) issuance of directions 
to the respondent to ensure that access is given 
to the person commissioned to make a listing 
of the mill properties to all mill lands including 
those of all private mills and is permitted to 
document the structures standing thereon; (iv) 
issuance of directions to the respondent to 
consider the listing forwarded to it under (ii) 
above, and to submit a listing of those structures 
which it agrees require to be listed to the 
Respondent within such time as Bombay High 
Court deem ﬁt; (v) issuance of directions to the 
respondent to notify under Regulation 67 of the 
D.C. Regulations a listing of the said structures 
in (iv) above; and (vi) issuance of directions to 
ensure that no permission for development/
redevelopment of any of the structures standing 
on any of the mill lands are granted until the 
directions issued in Petition are complied with.
  Indiabulls Real Estate Company Private Limited 
(now known as One International Center Private 
Limited- OICPL) was impleaded as a respondent 
in the present Writ Petition as they were already 
a party to the earlier writ petition (disclosure 
in clause B (1) above) by way of a chamber 
summons, which was pending at the time. 
Indiabulls Real Estate Company Private Limited 
(now known as One International Center Private 
Limited) along with certain other respondents 
have ﬁled aﬃdavits in reply to the Petition before 
the Bombay High Court, 
inter alia, opposing the 
admission of the Petition and/or grant of the 
abovementioned reliefs therein. An aﬃdavit in 
rejoinder was ﬁled in October 2005 on behalf 
of the petitioners for the purpose of refuting 
the statements made in the aﬃdavits in reply 
ﬁled by certain respondents. A notice of motion 
(“Notice of Motion”) was ﬁled in February 2006 
by the petitioners before the Bombay High Court 
praying, 
inter alia, that pending the hearing and 
ﬁnal disposal of the Petition, the respondents 
be restrained from in any manner, demolishing, 
destroying, or in any other manner prejudicing 
the integrity of the structures/sites in the mills 
or from permitting such action, as the case may 
be. The Bombay High Court by way of its interim 
order passed in March, 2006, (“ Interim Order”) 
directed the private mill owners to protect the 
structures which are identiﬁed as heritage 
structures. Thereafter, an aﬃdavit in reply to 
Notice of Motion, has been ﬁled in April, 2006 on 
behalf of one of the respondents, opposing the 
grant of any reliefs under the Notice of Motion or 
the Petition and for setting aside of the Interim 
Order. The matter is currently pending.
3.  Elite Life Trust and others (the “ Petitioners”) 
have ﬁled a public interest litigation, (“Petition”)

Trust Overview
Commissioner of Mumbai (MCGM and State 
of Maharashtra, collectively referred to the 
“State Authorities ”), Indiabulls Real Estate 
Company Private Limited (currently known 
as One International Center Private Limited) , 
Indiabulls Properties Private Limited and others 
(the “Defendants”) relating to the purchase of 
the land of Elphinstone Spinning and Weaving 
Mills (Indiabulls Real Estate Company Private 
Limited) and Jupiter Textiles Mills (Indiabulls 
Properties Private Limited) situated at Senapati 
Bapat Marg, Elphinstone Road, Mumbai 400 013, 
Maharashtra, India (collectively, the “Plots”). Post 
receipt of the requisite approvals from the State 
Authorities, the owners of the Plots (“ Owners”) 
were directed by the MCGM to pay additional 
premium with respect to their respective Plots on 
account of amendments to the ready reckoner 
rates for Plots along with the agreed upon 
terms for payment of premium for additional 
FSI granted with respect to the Plots. At the 
same time, the Owners had ﬁled an application 
before the State of Maharashtra for changing 
the market rates of the Plots, and pursuant to 
an order of the State of Maharashtra, the market 
value of the Plots were reduced in the ready 
reckoner, which the Petitioners have alleged 
inter alia , resulted in a loss of revenue of the 
Urban Development Department, Government 
of Maharashtra (“ Urban Development 
Department”). Accordingly, the Petitioners, by 
way of the Petition, have alleged that, 
inter alia, 
the State of Maharashtra and Inspector General 
of Registration and Controller of Stamps allowed 
the change in market value of the Plots without 
following due process of law, resulting in a loss of 
revenue for the Urban Development Department. 
The Petitioners have further alleged that, 
inter 
alia, (i) the State Authorities have caused loss of 
public money, which could have been used for 
welfare and beneﬁcial schemes for the citizens 
of the State of Maharashtra;
  (ii) a biased decision has been taken in respect 
of the Plots since no beneﬁts were given to the 
plots of other mills and other developers; and 
(iii) that the State of Maharashtra has suﬀered 
a loss of ` 7,014.11 million and has sought an 
investigation into the matter by the Central 
Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement 
Directorate. The matter is currently pending.
4.  Nitesh Mohanlal Doshi has ﬁled a public interest 
litigation related to the land bearing F.P.No.612 
(1,128.77 meters) and 613 (33,254.16 meters) of 
TPS-IV, Mahim division (Elphinstone Textile Mill) 
underlying One International Center and One 
Unity Center, situated at Senapati Bapat Marg, 
Dadar (West), Mumbai (“Elphinstone Mill Plot”). 
The original public interest litigation was ﬁled

Court of Judicature at Bombay (“ Bombay High 
Court”) against the Municipal Commissioner, 
Mumbai Municipal Corporation; the Directorate 
of Industries; the Executive Engineer—(BP 
City-III), Mumbai Municipal Corporation; and 
Indiabulls Real Estate Company Private Limited

Limited), wherein the petitioner has challenged 
the Mumbai Municipal Corporation’s decision 
to grant permission to Indiabulls Real Estate 
Company Private Limited (now known as One

  In February 2012, the petitioner amended his 
Original Petition (“ Amended Petition”) and re-
ﬁled the same before the Bombay High Court 
alleging illegalities in the approval of plans, 
layout and granting of various permission for 
the development of the Elphinstone Mills Plot. 
Pursuant to the Amended Petition, the petitioner 
has alleged, 
inter alia, that (i) permissions granted 
condoning the various mandatory requirements 
of Development Control Regulations, 1991 are 
illegal and not sustainable in law; (ii) concessions 
granted by the Executive Engineer—(BP City-
III), Mumbai Municipal Corporation related to

shall be permitted to lease out the property 
by way of new leases or renewal of existing 
leases subject to the result of the pending suit, 
and the judgment shall be binding on the third

1.  OQRPL (formerly known as Ashkit Properties 
Limited) vide sale deed executed in August, 
2017 purchased the property situated at Plot 
No. 20, Urban Estate, Sector 18, Gurugram, 
Haryana (the “Property”) underlying One Qube 
from Torus Buildcon Private Limited (“ Torus”). 
Thereafter, certain entities of the Blackstone 
Sponsor Group acquired 50% interest in OQRPL 
in 2018 and the remaining in 2019 from third 
parties. Subsequently, OQRPL has received 
notice of a precept order dated December 15, 
2023, (the “ Impugned Order ”) passed by the 
High Court of Judicature at Delhi (“ Delhi High 
Court”) against Torus, the previous owner of the 
Property, in connection with an arbitral award 
involving Torus, and has directed the attachment 
and sale of the Property and distribution of 
the sale proceeds accordingly. The Civil Court, 
Gurugram has pursuant to the Impugned Order 
issued a warrant of sale dated January 18, 2024 
(“Warrant of Sale”).
  Being the current owner of the Property, OQRPL 
sought to be impleaded in the matter pursuant 
to an application dated January 24, 2024 ﬁled 
before the Delhi High Court on the grounds 
inter alia that OQRPL being the current owner 
of the Property is a necessary and proper 
party to the proceedings and was not made 
aware of the proceedings and that material 
facts concerning the change in ownership of 
the Property were not brought to light by the 
parties to the proceeding. Further, OQRPL ﬁled 
an intervention application dated January 25, 
2024 before the Delhi High Court (“Intervention 
Application”), claiming that the Property cannot 
be attached or sold since it has already been 
sold to OQRPL in August 2017 by Torus and that 
OQRPL held clear title over the Property since 
then. OQRPL in the Intervention Application 
prayed that the Delhi High Court, 
inter alia; (i) 
pass an order, staying the Impugned Order 
allowing attachment of the Property; (ii) modify 
the Impugned Order to the extent it relates to 
the Property; and (iii) stay the warrant of sale 
issued by Civil Court at Gurugram on January 
18, 2024. A single judge bench of the Delhi High 
Court pursuant to its order dated January 25, 
2024, refused to grant any interim reliefs sought 
pursuant to the Intervention Application. OQRPL 
thereafter ﬁled an appeal against the order of the 
single judge bench on January 28, 2024 before 
a division bench of the Delhi High Court. The

K. One BKC
1.  Raghuleela Builders Private Limited (“ RBPL”) 
has assigned its leasehold right, title, and 
interest in 34 units forming a part of One BKC 
admeasuring 39,645 square meters in favor of 
OBRPL in 2019 for the residue of the unexpired 
term under the lease deed dated July 15, 2008 
read with the supplementary lease deed dated 
October 29, 2013 (collectively “ Lease Deeds ”), 
executed between Reliance Industries Limited 
Legal and Regulatory Matters (Contd.)
104 Half Yearly Report FY 2025-26
(“RIL”) and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region 
Development Authority (“ MMRDA”). The NCLT, 
Mumbai Bench, (“ NCLT”) has pursuant to an 
order passed in October, 2021, admitted RBPL 
under a corporate insolvency resolution process 
(“CIRP”) in accordance with the provisions 
of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 
(“IBC”) and a resolution professional has 
been appointed for managing the aﬀairs of 
RBPL. Owing to certain inter-creditor disputes 
between the ﬁnancial creditors, the NCLT vide 
its order in February, 2024, passed an interim 
stay restraining the committee of creditors 
from considering and approving any resolution 
plan during the pendency of such dispute. The 
statutory period of 270 days granted under IBC 
for completion of the CIRP period has expired. 
However, the NCLT vide its order in June 2024, 
granted an extension for the continuation of the 
CIRP. This matter is currently pending.
  As part of the committee of creditors, OBRPL 
was also arrayed as a party to an interlocutory 
application ﬁled in February, 2024, before the 
NCLT, by Kabra & Associates (“Applicant”), which 
was one of the prospective resolution applicants 
in relation to the CIRP, wherein the Applicant 
claimed that it was denied the opportunity 
to submit revised distribution criteria for its 
resolution plan, while other applicants were 
allowed to revise theirs after the Applicant’s 
earlier distribution criteria were disclosed, 
thereby granting them an unfair advantage. This 
matter is currently pending. As RBPL continues 
to remain the lessee under the lease deed with 
the MMRDA, the insolvency of RBPL is one of the 
grounds on which the MMRDA may terminate 
the lease deed or seek to realise any unrealised 
dues of RBPL from the present unitholders of 
One BKC.
2.  RBPL, has ﬁled a writ petition before the High 
Court of Judicature at Bombay (“ Bombay High 
Court”) against MMRDA and another (“ Writ 
Petition”) in connection with a demand of the 
MMRDA seeking lease premium for an additional 
built up area of 67,000 square meters. In the said 
Writ Petition, RBPL has 
inter alia  sought relief 
requiring (i) MMRDA to be directed to calculate 
the outstanding amount as per the provisions of 
the supplementary lease deed dated October 29, 
2013; and (ii) MMRDA to be directed to issue the 
relevant no objection certiﬁcates and occupancy 
certiﬁcate for the project as interim reliefs. The 
Bombay High Court, vide its order in February 
2019 (“February 2019 Order”) 
inter alia directed 
(i) MMRDA to provide a computation for the 
lease premium within 10 days of the order; (ii) 
RBPL to deposit the said amount within 3 months 
of receiving communication of the computation 
from MMRDA, subject to the ﬁnal outcome of the 
litigation; and (iii) MMRDA to issue (a) an NOC 
for assignment of an area of 40,386 (corrected to 
40,836) square meters in the building to OBRPL; 
and (b) proportionate occupation certiﬁcate 
for the property, within 1 week of receiving the 
said amount. MMRDA submitted a computation 
of ` 7,826 million which was challenged by 
RBPL by way of a notice of motion ﬁled in 
March 2019 before the Bombay High Court. In 
March 2019 MMRDA and RBPL ﬁled separate 
review petitions seeking review of the February 
2019 Order. MMRDA subsequently submitted a 
revised computation of ` 5,411.64 million which 
was accepted by RBPL, and the court in March 
2019 (“ March 2019 Order ”) directed RBPL to 
pay the same to the MMRDA within 3 months of 
the order. On receipt of the payment, MMRDA 
issued a no-objection certiﬁcate in March 2019 
(“Final NOC ”), for the assignment of 40,386 
(corrected to 40,836) square meters to OBRPL 
stating 
inter alia  that the same was subject to 
(i) the rights and contentions raised and likely 
to be raised by MMRDA in all proceedings 
pending before the court; (ii) the terms of the 
lease deeds and the same being binding on the 
assignee (i.e. OBRPL); and (iii) all the obligations 
devolving upon Reliance Industries Limited 
(“RIL”) and RBPL under the lease deeds, being 
performed in accordance with the lease deeds 
and being binding on the assignee (OBRPL). 
While the Bombay High Court struck down 
such conditions pursuant to its order passed in 
April 2019 (“ April 2019 Order ”), and clariﬁed 
that the eventual buyer/lessee (OBRPL) would 
have no liability of payment arising out of the 
legal proceedings, the April 2019 Order (and the 
February 2019 Order and March 2019 Order) was 
challenged by the MMRDA in July 2019 by ﬁling 
a Special Leave Petition (“SLP”) in the Supreme 
Court of India (“Supreme Court”). The Supreme 
Court pursuant to its order passed in August 
2019, reinstated the conditions mentioned in the 
Final NOC. Further, as regards the liability being 
aﬃxed on unit holders, RBPL represented to 
the Supreme Court that it owns 18,660 square

meters of the property, suﬃcient to meet its 
liability, if any, pursuant to the proceedings (“SC 
Undertaking”). Accordingly, the Supreme Court 
ordered that such area would stand as security 
for dues, if any, determined by the Bombay High 
Court in the Writ Petition. At the time of making 
the SC Undertaking, RBPL did not provide details 
of the units/area underlying the SC Undertaking. 
The MMRDA ﬁled a contempt petition against 
certain directors of RBPL 
inter alia  contending 
that the contents of the SC Undertaking was 
incorrect and sought for the area oﬀered by 
RBPL under the SC Undertaking to be clearly 
identiﬁed and demarcated. In February 2020, 
RBPL ﬁled a Miscellaneous Application (“MA”) in 
the SLP, seeking modiﬁcation of the directions 
contained in the aforementioned order passed 
in August 2019 speciﬁcally with regard to the 
SC Undertaking. As part of the MA, RBPL had 
submitted a list of the unsold inventory of RBPL 
and RIL. The description of the unsold inventory 
mentions only the ﬂoors and does not mention 
the unit and wing numbers. RBPL has contended 
that the SC Undertaking given vide the August 
2019 order was correct. The Supreme Court 
heard the MA and passed an order in September 
2021, 
inter alia, recording that both parties were 
ad idem that the matter would be resolved once 
the Writ Petition was decided by the Bombay 
High Court. The matter is currently pending. 
RBPL has ﬁled another writ petition in 2019 
against the MMRDA before the Bombay High 
Court challenging certain demand notices issued 
by MMRDA and seeking a refund of development 
charges paid by it. The matter is still pending.
L. Sattva Horizon
1.  Siddheshwari Griha Nirman Private Limited (now 
known as Sattva Horizon Private Limited) has 
ﬁled two separate writ petitions, each in January 
2021 before the High Court of Karnataka at 
Bengaluru (“Karnataka High Court”) against the 
State of Karnataka and others (“ Writ Petition 
1 and Writ Petition 2 ” and collectively, “ Writ 
Petitions”).
  Pursuant to the Writ Petitions the petitioner has 
challenged (a) the notiﬁcation issued in February 
2020, which made eﬀective the Karnataka 
Planning Authorities (Amendment) Rules, 2019 
(“Impugned Notiﬁcation ”) which provided 
the revision of the development fee and taxes 
the mode and method of collection along with 
the plan for utilisation of such fee; and (b) the 
demand notice issued by the Joint Director 
of Town Planning (North) to the petitioner 
demanding to deposit alleged arrears in payment 
of betterment charges, water supply scheme fee, 
ring road surcharge, slums improvement cess, 
etc. aggregating to ` 30.35 million (“ Demand 
Notice”). The petitioner has alleged, 
inter alia , 
that (i) the Demand Notice issued pursuant to 
the Impugned Notiﬁcation arbitrarily calculated 
the fees based on a percentage of market value 
of the property without providing any adequate 
basis of such charges; (ii) the calculation of fees 
by linking it to the market value of the property is 
unreasonable; and (iii) the imposition of fees for 
the same set of services in the guise of diﬀerent 
headings is unreasonable and arbitrary.
  The petitioner in Writ Petition 1 has, 
inter alia , 
prayed that the Karnataka High Court (i) grant 
an order, direction or writ in the nature of 
mandamus directing the respondents not to insist 
for payment of MTRS surcharge, water supply 
scheme, ring road surcharge, slums improvement 
cess, subsequent to amendments in the 
Karnataka Planning Authorities (Amendment) 
Rules, 2019; (ii) grant an order, direction or writ 
in the nature of certiorari quashing the Demand 
Notice, insofar it relates to insist for payment of 
MTRS surcharge, water supply scheme, ring road 
surcharge, slums improvement cess, aggregating 
to ` 25.65 million (ii) grant an order, direction or 
declare that the MTRS surcharge, water supply 
scheme, ring road surcharge, slums improvement 
cess levied on the basis of the market value of the 
property are all bad in law; and (iii) declare that 
MTRS surcharge, water supply scheme, ring road 
surcharge, slums improvement cess levied on 
the petitioner is bad in law. The Karnataka High 
Court has granted an interim order to stay the 
Demand Notice in February, 2021. The Karnataka 
High Court, by way of a common order on June 5, 
2025, partly allowed the Writ Petition 1 and, 
inter 
alia, partly quashed the Impugned Notiﬁcation 
and Demand Notice, while recommending the 
BBMP to consider a one time settlement scheme.
  Additionally, the petitioner in Writ Petition 2 has, 
inter alia , prayed the Karnataka High Court to, 
(i) grant an order, direction or writ in the nature 
of mandamus directing the respondents not to 
insist for payment of enhanced development 
charges in respect of development and 
construction of commercial building to the 
Legal and Regulatory Matters (Contd.)
106 Half Yearly Report FY 2025-26
petitioner subsequent to amendments in the 
Karnataka Planning Authorities (Amendment) 
Rules, 2019; (ii) grant an order, direction or writ 
in the nature of certiorari quashing the Demand 
Notice, insofar it relates to development fees/
charges on building and sitecare, aggregating to 
` 4.68 million and (ii) grant an order, direction or 
declare that the enhanced development changes 
levied on the basis of the market value of the 
property are all bad in law. The High Court has 
granted an interim order to stay the Demand 
Notice in February, 2021.
2.  Siddheshwari Griha Nirman Private Limited (now 
known as Sattva Horizon Private Limited) (the 
“Petitioner”) has ﬁled a writ petition before 
the High Court of Karnataka at Bengaluru (the 
“Karnataka High Court ”) against the Joint 
Director (Town Planning) North Zone and others 
(the “Respondent”), challenging a demand notice 
issued by the Respondent under the Karnataka 
Municipal Corporations and Certain other Laws 
(Amendment) Act, 2021 (“ Impugned Act ”) 
requiring payment of ground rent and scrutiny 
fees aggregating to ` 151.22 million (“ Fees”). 
The Petitioner entered into a joint development 
agreement with the owners of the land situated 
at Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike khata no. 
1303/6/1 & 7/1, ward no. 1, Venaakatala, measuring 
about 6 acres 37 guntas, for development of the 
property. Subsequently, the Petitioner applied for 
plan sanction along with all necessary documents 
viz. of the encumbrance certiﬁcate, property 
tax receipt, khata extract and khata certiﬁcate. 
Thereafter, the Petitioner obtained a plan sanction 
and commencement certiﬁcate for the project 
from the Respondent and requested issuance 
of the occupancy certiﬁcate. Subsequently, the 
Respondent issued a demand notice in July 2024 
to the Petitioner in connection with payment of 
the Fees. The Petitioner, in the writ petition has 
alleged that the Fees have been charged illegally 
and arbitrarily under the Karnataka Municipal 
Corporations Act, 1976 and that the Impugned Act 
suﬀers legislative competence and is 
ultra vires to 
the Constitution of India. The Petitioner prayed 
before the Karnataka High Court amongst 
others to (i) issue a writ of certiorari to quash 
the Impugned Act; (ii) declare the levy of Fees 
through the Demand Notice as arbitrary and 
illegal; and (iii) issue interim order to issue 
occupancy certiﬁcate without insisting payment 
of the Fees. The Karnataka High Court, pursuant 
to an interim order dated August 7, 2024, has 
stayed the payment of (i) 50% of the scrutiny 
fee, and (ii) 100% of the ground rent during 
the pendency of the petition. Additionally, the 
Petitioner is required to furnish an indemnity 
bond to secure the payment of the remaining 
amount in the event of its failure in the writ 
petition. The Karnataka High Court has allowed 
the writ petition.

aside the Order as it set aside the order 
passed in June, 2018 by the TAT, wherein it 
was held that for Tower C, the assessment 
of property at commercial rate is incorrect

inter 
alia, that (i) Order conﬁrming the order 
passed in March, 2015, and setting aside the 
order passed in June, 2018, passed by the 
TAT, is against the law and misinterpretation 
of statute; (ii) the respondent has let out the 
property to commercial establishment and 
derives income from the building by means 
of rent and lease sum; (iii) the property’s use 
(commercial, residential, or factory) directly 
aﬀects the tax tariﬀ and leasing properties 
does not qualify under the deﬁnitions 
of industry or factory; (iv) the activities 
of tenants in the building fall under the 
deﬁnition of “Commercial Establishments”

as per the Tamil Nadu Shops and Commercial 
Establishments Act, 1961; (v) the occupants 
of the property are not engaged in industrial 
activities or manufacturing of goods for sale; 
(vi) the court has erroneously considered 
the respondent’s deﬁnition of “industry”, 
which is irrelevant for determining property 
tax; (vii) the respondent is not registered as 
an industrial entity and lacks certiﬁcations 
from relevant industrial authorities; (viii) 
the building is rented to commercial 
establishments, including banks and 
restaurants, and no portion is used for 
industrial purposes; and (ix) the respondent 
holds a trade license for the trade/business 
of infrastructure development for IT/
ITES companies, which classiﬁes it as a 
commercial establishment, not an factory. 
By way of the Writ Petitions, the petitioner 
has prayed for an interim stay on the Order. 
The matter is currently pending.

Knowledge Realty Trust 135
Trust Overview
A. Risks related to our Organisation and Structure:
 1.  The Portfolio has certain liabilities, which 
if realised may impact the trading price of 
the units, our proﬁtability and our ability to 
make distributions.
 2.  We do not provide any assurance or 
guarantee of any distributions to the 
Unitholders. We may not be able to make 
distributions to Unitholders and the level of 
distributions may decrease. Our historical 
distributions may not be indicative of  
future distributions.
 3.  We have incurred external debt at the Trust 
level. Additionally, we may incur further debt 
at the Trust level and/or the portfolio level, 
and a signiﬁcant amount of such future 
debt may be utilised in the operation and 
development of our business. Consequently, 
our cash ﬂows and operating results could be 
adversely aﬀected by required repayments 
or related interest and other risks of our 
debt ﬁnancing. The terms of such ﬁnancing 
or any inability to service debt may impact 
distributions to Unitholders.
 4.  The REIT Regulations impose restrictions on 
the investments made by us and require us 
to adhere to certain investment conditions, 
which may limit our ability to acquire 
and/or dispose of assets or explore new 
opportunities. The laws governing REITs in 
India are evolving and relatively untested.
 5.  The holding and ﬁnancing structure of 
certain entities within our Portfolio may not 
be tax eﬃcient.
B. Risks related to our Business and Industry:
 1.  The Trust has a limited operating history 
and may not be able to operate the business 
successfully or generate suﬃcient cash 
ﬂows to make or sustain distributions.
 2.  Our business, revenues and proﬁtability 
are dependent on the performance of 
the commercial real estate market in 
India, particularly in our portfolio core 
markets (currently Bengaluru, Hyderabad 
and Mumbai). Fluctuations in the general 
economic, market and other conditions may 
aﬀect the commercial real estate market 
in India and in turn, our ability to lease our 
portfolio assets to tenants on favorable terms.
Risk Factors
 3.  We depend on the leasing activities at certain 
portfolio assets for a signiﬁcant portion of 
our revenue and any adverse developments 
aﬀecting such portfolio assets could have 
an adverse eﬀect on our business, results of 
operations and ﬁnancial condition.
 4.  A signiﬁcant portion of our revenues is 
derived from a limited number of large 
tenants, multinational tenants, including 
global capability centers (GCC), as well 
as tenants in the technology and banking, 
ﬁnancial services and insurance (BFSI) 
sectors. Any conditions that impact these 
tenants or the respective sectors or cities 
in which they operate may adversely aﬀect 
our business, results and ﬁnancial condition.
 5.  Tenant leases across our portfolio are subject 
to the risk of non-renewal, non-replacement, 
default, early termination, regulatory or 
legal proceedings or changes in applicable 
laws or regulations, thereby impacting 
leasing and other income. Further, vacant 
properties could be diﬃcult to lease, which 
could adversely aﬀect our revenues.
 6.  Compliance with, and changes in 
applicable laws, including but not limited 
to environmental, health and safety laws 
and regulations, could adversely aﬀect the 
development of our properties. Any inability 
to obtain, maintain or renew all regulatory 
approvals that are required may have an 
adverse impact on our business, ﬁnancial 
condition, results of operations, cash ﬂows 
and prospects.
 7.  We have entered into and may in the future 
enter into material related party transactions, 
the terms of which may be unfavorable to 
us or could involve conﬂicts of interest. The 
Manager may face conﬂicts of interests in 
choosing our service providers, and certain 
service providers may provide services to 
the Manager, the Sponsors or the Sponsor 
Groups on more favorable terms than those 
payable by us.
 8.  The title, leasehold rights and development 
rights or other interests over land where our 
portfolio assets are located may be subject 
to legal uncertainties and defects, which 
may interfere with our ownership and/or 
leasehold rights of our portfolio assets and 
136 Half Yearly Report FY 2025-26
Risk Factors (Contd.)
result in us incurring costs to remedy and 
cure such defects.
 9.  We operate in a competitive environment 
and increasing competitive pressure  
could adversely aﬀect our business and  
the ability of the Manager to execute our 
growth strategy.
 10.  There are outstanding litigations and 
regulatory actions involving our assets, the 
Sattva Sponsor Group and the associates of 
the Sattva Sponsor that may adversely aﬀect 
our business. The directors, promoters, key 
personnel and employees, as applicable, of 
our sponsors, sponsor groups, the Manager 
and the portfolio entities may also, from 
time to time, be involved in various legal 
proceedings. They may also hold board 
positions in other third-party entities, which 
could expose them to potential litigations 
unrelated to our business. Further, aﬃliates 
of our sponsors and sponsor groups may be 
sponsors, promoters of other entities which 
could expose them to ongoing and potential 
litigations or regulatory proceedings.
 11.  We do not own the trademark or logo for 
‘Knowledge Realty Trust’ or ‘Sattva’ and 
hence our inability to use or protect these 
intellectual property rights may have an 
adverse eﬀect on our business, results of 
operations and cash ﬂows.
 12.  Our Asset SPVs and the Investment 
Entity are subject to ongoing compliance 
requirements under various laws, and there 
have been certain past instances of non-
compliance, and there may be instances of 
non-compliance in the future.
 13.  There have been certain instances of delay 
in payment of statutory dues by the Trust 
and the portfolio entities in the past. Any 
failure or delay in payment of such statutory 
dues may expose the Manager, the Trust 
and the portfolio entities to the statutory 
and regulatory action, as well as signiﬁcant 
penalties, and may adversely impact our 
business, results of operations, cash ﬂows 
and ﬁnancial condition.
 14.  We may be subject to certain restrictive 
covenants and variable interest rates under 
our ﬁnancing agreements that could limit 
our ﬂexibility in managing our business, 
ability to use cash or other assets which 
could cause our debt service obligations to 
increase signiﬁcantly.
 15.  Our revenues, results of operations, cash 
ﬂows and ﬁnancial condition may be 
adversely aﬀected by low occupancy and 
rent levels of our portfolio assets.
 16.  Recent disruptions in the ﬁnancial markets 
and current economic conditions could 
increase our interest rates and ﬁnance costs, 
which could adversely aﬀect our ability to 
service existing indebtedness.
 17.  Certain agreements including lease deeds 
with some of our tenants are not adequately 
stamped or registered, and consequently, 
we may be unable to successfully litigate 
over the said agreements in the future and 
penalties may be imposed on us.
 18.  Some of the assets in our portfolio are 
located on land leased from diﬀerent land 
development and regulatory authorities 
and other third parties. We are also entitled 
to development rights from certain land 
development authorities with respect to 
certain portfolio assets. Further certain 
portfolio assets are located on land notiﬁed as 
Special Economic Zones (SEZ). The relevant 
assets are required to comply with the terms 
and conditions provided in the respective 
lease agreements or the SEZ legislation, as 
applicable, failing which the relevant land/
SEZ authorities or other third parties as the 
case may be, may impose penalties, terminate 
the lease or take over the premises. We may 
also not able to renew such leases upon its 
expiry or premature termination.
 19.  If we are unable to maintain relationships 
with other stakeholders in our portfolio, our 
cash ﬂows, ﬁnancial conditions and results 
of operation may be adversely aﬀected.
 20.  The valuation reports obtained for our 
portfolio are based on various assumptions 
and may not be indicative of the true value 
of our assets.
 21.  The report of the statutory auditors of the 
Trust on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
and the standalone ﬁnancial statements 
contains certain matters of emphasis.
 22.  Our contingent liabilities could adversely 
aﬀect our ﬁnancial condition, results of 
operations and cash ﬂows.
Financial StatementsStatutory Reports
Knowledge Realty Trust 137
Trust Overview
Risk Factors (Contd.)
 23.  We rely on third-party operators to 
successfully operate and manage certain 
portfolio assets and on contractors and third 
parties in developing our future development 
and construction projects. Our results of 
operations and cash ﬂows may be adversely 
aﬀected if we fail to eﬀectively oversee the 
functioning of third-party operators.
 24.  There can be no assurance that any planned 
future development will be completed in 
its entirety in accordance with anticipated 
timelines or costs or that we will achieve 
the results expected from such projects, 
which may adversely aﬀect our business, 
ﬁnancial condition, results of operations and  
cash ﬂows.
 25.  We require capital expenditure in connection 
with our operations, and any failure to secure 
funding for the required capital expenditure, 
working capital requirements and any 
acquisition ﬁnancing, including through 
debt ﬁnancing, on acceptable terms may 
have an adverse impact on our business, 
ﬁnancial condition, results of operations and 
cash ﬂows.
 26.  Our portfolio assets may be subject to 
increases in direct expenses and other 
operating expenses. Renovation work, repair 
and maintenance or physical damage to our 
portfolio assets may disrupt our operations 
and collection of rental income or otherwise 
result in an adverse impact on our ﬁnancial 
condition and results of operations.
 27.  We are exposed to a variety of risks 
associated with safety, security and crisis 
management, and may incur losses as a 
result of unforeseen or catastrophic events, 
including but not limited to wars, pandemics, 
terrorist attacks, extreme weather events, 
natural disasters and widespread health 
emergencies that could create economic 
and ﬁnancial disruptions, which could lead 
to operational diﬃculties (including travel 
limitations) that impair/impact our ability to 
manage our businesses.
 28.  We may be unable to successfully grow our 
business in new geographic markets in India, 
which may adversely aﬀect our growth proﬁle, 
business prospects, results of operations, cash 
ﬂows and ﬁnancial condition.
 29.  We may be required to record signiﬁcant 
charges to earnings in the future when we 
review our portfolio for potential impairment 
of property, plant and equipment and 
investment property, including under 
construction property and goodwill.
 30.  We may not be successful in any future 
acquisitions, and there can be no assurance 
that we will be able to successfully manage 
any assets we may acquire in the future. 
Further, any of our acquisitions in the future 
may be subject to acquisition-related risks.
 31.  Inadequate facility management could 
reduce the attractiveness of our portfolio 
and as a result, adversely aﬀect our business, 
ﬁnancial condition, results of operations and 
cash ﬂows.
 32.  The operations of our solar assets are 
dependent on the regulatory and policy 
environment aﬀecting the renewable energy 
sector in India, and any such changes to any 
laws, rules and regulations to which we are 
subject may have a material adverse eﬀect 
on our business, ﬁnancial condition, cash 
ﬂows, and results of operations.
 33.  Any downgrading of India’s sovereign debt 
rating by a domestic or international rating 
agency could materially and adversely aﬀect 
our ability to obtain ﬁnancing and, in turn, 
our business and ﬁnancial performance.
 34.  We may not be able to maintain adequate 
insurance to cover all losses we may incur in 
our business operations.
 35.  Our business may be adversely aﬀected by 
the illiquidity of real estate investments.
 36.  Security and information technology risks 
may disrupt our business, result in losses or 
limit our growth.
C.  Risks related to our relationships with the 
Sponsors and the Manager:
 1.  The Blackstone Sponsor has not entered 
into a deed of right of ﬁrst oﬀer in respect 
of any assets operated by the Blackstone 
Sponsor Group or other entities of the 
Blackstone Group which could lead to 
potential conﬂicts of interest.
 2.  The deed of right of ﬁrst oﬀer entered into 
with the Sattva Sponsor is subject to various 
terms and conditions, and there can be no 
138 Half Yearly Report FY 2025-26
assurance that we will acquire any of these 
assets. The Sattva Sponsor may undertake 
corporate restructuring exercises, including 
mergers and amalgamations with third-party 
entities, as a result of which the potential 
asset pipeline available to us under the deed 
of right of ﬁrst oﬀer may be impacted.
 3.  There may be changes to the Parties to 
the Trust and their respective associates 
in the future subject to the framework 
under the REIT Regulations. Subject to 
the REIT Regulations and contractual 
arrangements, our sponsors and sponsor 
group entities may decide to sell some or 
all of their unitholding after the expiry of the 
mandatory lock-in period prescribed under 
the REIT Regulations. Our sponsors or 
sponsor group entities may also undertake 
corporate actions or other restructuring 
exercises in the future, as a result of which 
there may be changes to the associates and/
or sponsor groups of the sponsors and/or 
the shareholding of the sponsors/sponsor 
group entities.
 4.  We and parties associated with us 
are required to maintain the eligibility 
conditions speciﬁed under Regulation 
4 of the REIT Regulations as well as the 
certiﬁcate of registration on an ongoing 
basis. We may not be able to ensure such 
ongoing compliance by the sponsors, their 
respective sponsor groups, the Manager 
and the Trustee, which could result in the 
cancelation of our registration.
 5.  Our sponsors will be able to exercise 
signiﬁcant inﬂuence over certain of our 
activities, and the interests of the sponsors 
may conﬂict with the interests of other 
Unitholders, or the interest of the sponsors 
may conﬂict with each other.
 6.  Conﬂicts of interest may arise out of 
common business objectives shared by the 
Manager, the Sattva Sponsor, the Sattva 
Sponsor Group, the Blackstone Sponsor, the 
Blackstone Sponsor Group and us.
 7.  Certain principals and employees may be 
involved in and have a greater ﬁnancial 
interest in the performance of other real 
estate investments, projects and businesses 
of the Sattva Group or Blackstone, and such 
activities may create conﬂicts of interest in 
making investment decisions on our behalf.
 8.   Blackstone Sponsor is a portfolio company 
of Blackstone real estate funds. Blackstone 
Inc. is an investment ﬁrms and a global 
alternative asset manager with diverse 
interests across the globe; any adverse 
impact on which could have a bearing on us 
and the performance of our Units.
 9.  We depend on the Manager and its 
personnel for our success. We may not ﬁnd 
a suitable replacement for the Manager if 
the Investment Management Agreement 
is terminated or if key personnel cease to 
be employed by the Manager or otherwise 
become unavailable to us.
 10.  We depend on the Manager to manage 
our business and assets, and our results of 
operations, cash ﬂows, ﬁnancial condition 
and ability to make distributions may be 
aﬀected if the Manager fails to perform 
satisfactorily, for which our recourse may  
be limited.
D. Risks related to India:
 1.  Our business is dependent on the Indian 
economy, ﬁnancial stability in Indian 
markets, policies and the political situation in 
India. Any slowdown in the Indian economy 
or in Indian ﬁnancial markets could have a 
material adverse eﬀect on our business.
 2.  Signiﬁcant diﬀerences exist between 
Ind AS and other accounting principles, 
such as IFRS and U.S. GAAP, which may 
be material to your assessment of our 
ﬁnancial condition, results of operations and  
cash ﬂows.
 3.  It may not be possible for Unitholders to 
enforce foreign judgments.
 4.  We are subject to taxes and other 
levies imposed by the central and state 
governments in India, as well as other 
ﬁnancial policies and regulations. Tax 
laws are subject to changes and diﬀering 
interpretations, which may materially 
and adversely aﬀect our operations and  
growth prospects.
 5.  Investors may be subject to Indian taxes 
arising out of capital gains on the sale of Units.
 6.  Land is subject to compulsory acquisition 
by the government and compensation in 
lieu of such acquisition may be inadequate.
Risk Factors (Contd.)

Knowledge Realty Trust 139
Trust Overview
 7.  We may be subject to the Competition 
Act, 2002, which may require us to receive 
approvals from the Competition Commission 
of India (CCI) prior to undertaking certain 
transactions.
 8.  Our ability to raise funding is dependent on 
our ability to raise capital through a fresh 
issue of Units and or our ability to raise 
debt on acceptable terms. Further, debt 
securities issued by us may not qualify as 
eligible securities that can be held by certain 
types of investors, and certain lenders may 
be unable to extend loans to us due to 
regulatory and other restrictions, which may 
make it more diﬃcult for us to raise funds 
and may increase the cost of borrowings.
E. Risks related to ownership of the Units:
 1.  Trusts such as us may be dissolved, and 
the proceeds from the dissolution thereof 
may be less than the amount invested by  
the Unitholders.
 2.  We are subject to ongoing reporting 
requirements. Requirements and other 
obligations of real estate investment trusts 
post-listing are still evolving. Accordingly, 
the level of ongoing disclosures made to 
and the protections granted to Unitholders 
may be limited as compared to those made 
to or available to the shareholders of a 
company that has listed its equity shares 
upon a recognised stock exchange in India.
 3.  Fluctuations in the exchange rate of 
the Indian Rupee with respect to other 
currencies will aﬀect the foreign currency 
equivalent of the value of the Units and  
any distributions.
 4.  Unitholders may experience delay or failure 
in the redemption of their Units.
 5.  The Units may experience price and volume 
ﬂuctuations. There can be no assurance on 
the trading price of the Units, and the price 
of the Units may decline. Also, the NAV per 
Unit may be diluted if further issues are 
priced below the current NAV per Unit. 
 6.  Any future issuance of Units by us or sales 
of Units by the sponsors or any other 
signiﬁcant Unitholders may materially and 
adversely aﬀect the trading price of the 
Units. We cannot assure you that we will not 
issue further Units or that the Unitholders, 
including the sponsors, the sponsor group 
entities and other signiﬁcant Unitholders, 
will not dispose of, pledge or otherwise 
encumber their Units.
 7.  Our rights and the rights of the Unitholders 
to recover claims against the Manager or the 
Trustee are limited.
 8.  Under Indian law, non-resident investors or 
foreign investors are subject to investment 
restrictions that limit our ability to attract 
foreign investors, which may adversely 
aﬀect the trading price of the Units.
 9.  Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act 
withholding may aﬀect payments on the 
Units for investors.
 10.  We may be classiﬁed as a Passive Foreign 
Investment Company (PFIC) for the current 
and/or future taxable years for U.S. federal 
income tax purposes, which could result in 
materially adverse U.S. federal income tax 
consequences to U.S. investors in our Units.

Independent Auditor’s Report
on Review of Unaudited Condensed Standalone Interim Financial Statements
To The Board of Directors of
Knowledge Realty Oﬃce Management Services 
Private Limited (“the Manager”)
(in its capacity as manager of the Knowledge Realty 
Trust)

INTRODUCTION
1.  We have reviewed the accompanying unaudited 
Condensed Standalone Interim Financial 
Statements of Knowledge Realty Trust (the 
“Trust”) which comprise the unaudited 
condensed standalone balance sheet as at 
September 30, 2025, the unaudited condensed 
standalone statement of proﬁt and loss, including 
other comprehensive income and unaudited 
condensed standalone statement of cash ﬂows 
for the half year ended September 30, 2025, the 
unaudited condensed standalone statement of 
changes in Unitholder’s equity and the unaudited 
statement of Net Distributable Cash Flows for 
the period ended September 30, 2025, and a 
summary of the material accounting policies 
and select explanatory information (together 
hereinafter referred to as the “Condensed 
Standalone Interim Financial Statements”).
2.  The Manager is responsible for the preparation 
of the Condensed Standalone Interim Financial 
Statements in accordance with the Indian 
Accounting Standard 34 (Ind AS 34) “Interim 
Financial Reporting”, speciﬁed under Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as 
amended, read with Securities and Exchange 
Board of India (Real Estate Investment Trusts) 
Regulations, 2014, as amended, including any 
guidelines and circulars issued thereunder 
(together referred as the “REIT Regulations”), 
and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India. The Condensed Standalone 
Interim Financial Statements has been approved 
by the Board of Directors of the Manager. Our 
responsibility is to express a conclusion on 
the Condensed Standalone Interim Financial 
Statements based on our review.
SCOPE OF REVIEW
3.  We conducted our review in accordance with 
the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 
2410, “Review of Interim Financial Information 
Performed by the Independent Auditor of the 
Entity” issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India. This standard requires 
that we plan and perform the review to 
obtain moderate assurance as to whether 
the Condensed Standalone Interim Financial 
Statements is free of material misstatement. A 
review consists of making inquiries, primarily of 
persons responsible for ﬁnancial and accounting 
matters, and applying analytical and other 
review procedures. A review is substantially less 
in scope than an audit conducted in accordance 
with Standards on Auditing and consequently 
does not enable us to obtain assurance that we 
would become aware of all signiﬁcant matters 
that might be identiﬁed in an audit. Accordingly, 
we do not express an audit opinion.
CONCLUSION
4.  Based on our review conducted as above, 
nothing has come to our attention that causes 
us to believe that the accompanying Condensed 
Standalone Interim Financial Statements have 
not been prepared in all material respects in 
accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 34, 
read with REIT Regulations and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India.
EMPHASIS OF MATTER
5.  We draw attention to note 12 of the Condensed 
Standalone Interim Financial Statements which 
describes the presentation/classiﬁcation of “Unit 
Capital” as “Equity” in order to comply with 
the mandatory requirements of the relevant 
REIT Regulations, instead of the applicable 
requirements of Ind AS 32 – Financial Instruments: 
Presentation.
  Our conclusion is not modiﬁed in respect of this 
matter.

 Notes:
 (i)  The Trust has not issued any units till March 31, 2025. Therefore, the disclosures in respect of NAV per 
unit as at March 31, 2025 has not been disclosed.
 (ii) Measurement of fair values:
   The fair value of investments in Assets SPVs and Investment entities (together referred as ‘SPVs’) 
are computed basis the fair value of the underlying investment properties, investment properties 
under development, property, plant and equipment and capital work-in-progress (together referred 
as “Speciﬁed assets”) as at September 30, 2025 along with book values of other assets and liabilities 
accounted in the respective SPV ﬁnancial statements as at September 30, 2025. The fair value of 
Speciﬁed assets have been determined by an independent external property valuer, having appropriately 
recognised professional qualiﬁcations and recent experience in the location and category of the 
property being valued.
  Valuation technique:
   The fair value measurement for all Speciﬁed assets have been categorised as Level 3 fair value based 
on the inputs to the valuation technique used.
   The valuer has followed a Discounted Cash Flow method. The valuation model considers the present 
value of net cash ﬂows to be generated from the respective properties, taking into account existing 
lease arrangements, expected rental growth rate, vacancy period, occupancy rate and lease incentive 
costs. The expected net cash ﬂows are discounted using the risk adjusted discount rates. Among other 
factors, the discount rate estimation considers the quality of a building and its location (prime vs 
secondary), tenant credit quality and lease terms.

2.  BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 2.1  Basis of Preparation and Statement of 
Compliance
   The Condensed Standalone Financial 
Statements (hereinafter referred to 
as the ‘Financial Statements’ or ‘SFS’) 
has been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of SEBI (Real Estate 
Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014 as 
amended from time to time including any 
guidelines and circulars issued thereunder 
read with SEBI master circular no. SEBI/
HO/DDHS-PoD-2/P/CIR/2025/99 for real 
estate investment trusts dated July 11, 2025, 
(‘SEBI Master Circular’) and other circulars 
issued thereunder (‘REIT Regulations’); 
Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 34 
“Interim Financial Reporting”, as prescribed 
in Rule 2(1)(a) of the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (as 
amended) and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, to the extent 
not inconsistent with the REIT regulations.
   The Financial Statements of the Trust 
comprises the Standalone balance sheet 
as at September 30, 2025, the Standalone 
Statement of Proﬁt and Loss, including other 
comprehensive income, the Standalone 
Statement of Cash Flow, the Statement of 
Net Distributable Cashﬂows of Knowledge 
Realty Trust, the Standalone Statement 
of Changes in Unitholders’ Equity and a 
summary of material accounting policies and 
other explanatory information for the quarter 
and half year ended September 30, 2025.
   The SFS have been prepared on going 
concern basis in accordance with 
accounting principles generally accepted in 
India. Further, the SFS have been prepared 
on the historical cost basis except for the 
accounting policies below. The accounting 
policies have been applied consistently over 
all the period presented in these SFS.
   All amounts disclosed in the SFS and notes 
have been rounded oﬀ to the nearest million 
as per the requirement of Schedule III, unless 
otherwise stated.
 2.2    Operating cycle and basis of classiﬁcation 
of assets and liabilities
   
Current versus non-current classiﬁcation
   The Trust presents assets and liabilities in 
the Balance Sheet based on current/ non-
current classiﬁcation.
  An asset is treated as current when it is:
  •  Expected to be realised or intended 
to be sold or consumed in normal 
operating cycle
  •  Held primarily for the purpose of 
trading
  •  Expected to be realised within twelve 
months after the reporting period, or
  •  Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted 
from being exchanged or used to settle 
a liability for at least twelve months 
after the reporting period
Knowledge Realty Trust
RN: IN/REIT/24-25/0006
Condensed Standalone Financial Statements
Notes to the Condensed Standalone Financial Statements (Contd.)
152 Half Yearly Report FY 2025-26
  All other assets are classiﬁed as non-current.
  A liability is current when:
  •  It is expected to be settled in normal 
operating cycle
  •  It is held primarily for the purpose of 
trading
  •  It is due to be settled within twelve 
months after the reporting period, or
  •  There is no unconditional right to defer 
the settlement of the liability for at 
least twelve months after the reporting 
period
   The terms of the liability that could, at the 
option of the counterparty, result in its 
settlement by the issue of equity instruments 
do not aﬀect its classiﬁcation.
   The Trust classiﬁes all other liabilities as 
non-current.
   Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
classiﬁed as non-current assets and 
liabilities.
   The operating cycle is the time between the 
acquisition of assets for processing and their 
realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The 
Trust has identiﬁed twelve months as its 
operating cycle.
 2.3 Use of judgements and estimates
   The preparation of the Financial Statements 
in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles in India requires 
management to make estimates and 
assumptions that aﬀect the reported 
amounts of assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses. Actual results could diﬀer from 
those estimates.
   Estimates and underlying assumptions are 
reviewed on a periodic basis. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimates are revised 
and in any future periods aﬀected.
   Information about critical judgements in 
applying accounting policies that have the 
most signiﬁcant eﬀect on the amounts 
recognised in the Financial Statements is 
included in the following notes:
  •  Presentation of “Unit Capital” as 
“Equity” in accordance with the REIT 
Regulations
  • Valuation of ﬁnancial instruments
  •  Estimation of useful life of property, 
plant and equipment and investment 
property
  •  Impairment and fair valuation of 
Investment Property, Investment 
property under construction, Property, 
plant and equipment and Capital work-
in-progress of the SPVs/Joint Venture
   Detailed information about each of these 
estimates and judgements is included in 
relevant notes together with information 
about the basis of calculation for each 
aﬀected line item in the Financial Statements.
 2.4 Foreign currencies
   The Financial Statements are presented in 
Indian Rupees (“`”), which is also the Trust’s 
functional currency and the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the 
Trust operates.
  Transactions and balances
   Transactions in foreign currencies are 
initially recorded by the Trust at their 
respective functional currency spot rates 
at the date the transaction ﬁrst qualiﬁes for 
recognition. However, for practical reasons, 
the Trust uses average rate if the average 
approximates the actual rate at the date of 
the transaction.
   Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are translated at the 
functional currency spot rates of exchange 
at the reporting date.
   Exchange diﬀerences arising on settlement 
or translation of monetary items are 
recognised in proﬁt or loss.
   Non-monetary items that are measured in 
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency 
are translated using the exchange rates at 
the dates of the initial transactions. Non-
monetary items measured at fair value in 
a foreign currency are translated using 
the exchange rates at the date when the 
Knowledge Realty Trust
RN: IN/REIT/24-25/0006
Condensed Standalone Financial Statements
Notes to the Condensed Standalone Financial Statements (Contd.)
Financial StatementsStatutory Reports
Knowledge Realty Trust 153
Trust Overview
fair value is determined. The gain or loss 
arising on translation of non-monetary 
items measured at fair value is treated in 
line with the recognition of the gain or loss 
on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., 
translation diﬀerences on items whose fair 
value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or 
proﬁt or loss are also recognised in OCI or 
proﬁt or loss, respectively).
   In determining the spot exchange rate 
to use on initial recognition of the related 
asset, expense or income (or part of it) on 
the derecognition of a non-monetary asset 
or non-monetary liability relating to advance 
consideration, the date of the transaction 
is the date on which the Trust initially 
recognises the non-monetary asset or non-
monetary liability arising from the advance 
consideration. If there are multiple payments 
or receipts in advance, the Trust determines 
the transaction date for each payment or 
receipt of advance consideration.
 2.5 Fair value measurement
   The Trust measures certain ﬁnancial 
instruments, such as, derivatives at fair value 
at each balance sheet date.
   Fair value is the price that would be received 
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability 
in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. The 
fair value measurement is based on the 
presumption that the transaction to sell 
the asset or transfer the liability takes place 
either:
  •  In the principal market for the asset or 
liability, or
  •  In the absence of a principal market, in 
the most advantageous market for the 
asset or liability
   The principal or the most advantageous 
market must be accessible by the Trust.
   The fair value of an asset or a liability is 
measured using the assumptions that 
market participants would use when pricing 
the asset or liability, assuming that market 
participants act in their economic best 
interest.
   A fair value measurement of a non-
ﬁnancial asset takes into account a market 
participant’s ability to generate economic 
beneﬁts by using the asset in its highest and 
best use or by selling it to another market 
participant that would use the asset in its 
highest and best use.
   The Trust uses valuation techniques that 
are appropriate in the circumstances and 
for which suﬃcient data are available to 
measure fair value, maximising the use of 
relevant observable inputs and minimising 
the use of unobservable inputs.
   All assets and liabilities for which fair value 
is measured or disclosed in the Financial 
Statements are categorised within the fair 
value hierarchy, described as follows, based 
on the lowest level input that is signiﬁcant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole:
  •  Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market 
prices in active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities
  •  Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which 
the lowest level input that is signiﬁcant 
to the fair value measurement is directly 
or indirectly observable
  •  Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which 
the lowest level input that is signiﬁcant 
to the fair value measurement is 
unobservable
   For assets and liabilities that are recognised 
in the Financial Statements on a recurring 
basis, the Trust determines whether transfers 
have occurred between levels in the hierarchy 
by re-assessing categorisation (based on the 
lowest level input that is signiﬁcant to the fair 
value measurement as a whole) at the end of 
each reporting period.
   The management determines the policies 
and procedures for both recurring fair 
value measurement, such as derivative 
instruments and unquoted ﬁnancial assets 
measured at fair value, and for non-recurring 
measurement, such as assets held for sale in 
discontinued operations.
   At each reporting date, the Management 
analyses the movements in the values of 
Knowledge Realty Trust
RN: IN/REIT/24-25/0006
Condensed Standalone Financial Statements
Notes to the Condensed Standalone Financial Statements (Contd.)
154 Half Yearly Report FY 2025-26
assets and liabilities which are required to 
be remeasured or re-assessed as per the 
Trust’s accounting policies.
   For the purpose of fair value disclosures, 
the Trust has determined classes of assets 
and liabilities on the basis of the nature, 
characteristics and risks of the asset or 
liability and the level of the fair value 
hierarchy as explained above.
 2.6 Revenue Recognition
   Revenue is measured at the amount 
of transaction price (net of variable 
consideration) received or receivable. 
This inter alia involves discounting of the 
consideration due to the present value if 
payment extends beyond normal credit 
terms.
   Revenue is recognised when recovery of the 
consideration is probable and the amount of 
revenue can be measured reliably.
   Recognition of dividend and interest 
income
   Dividend income is recognised in the 
statement of proﬁt and loss on the date 
on which Trust’s right to receive payment 
is established. except in case if dividend is 
towards repayment of cost of investment, 
then dividend is adjusted with the investment 
value of such subsidiary.
   Interest income is recognised using the 
eﬀective interest method. The ‘eﬀective 
interest rate’ is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash receipts through the 
expected life of the ﬁnancial instrument to 
the gross carrying amount of the ﬁnancial 
asset.
   In calculating interest income, the eﬀective 
interest rate is applied to the gross carrying 
amount of the asset (when the asset is not 
credit-impaired). However, for ﬁnancial 
assets that have become credit-impaired 
subsequent to initial recognition, interest 
income is calculated by applying the 
eﬀective interest rate to the amortised cost 
of the ﬁnancial asset.
 2.7 Taxes
  
Current income tax
   Current income tax assets and liabilities 
are measured at the amount expected to 
be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used 
to compute the amount are those that are 
enacted or substantively enacted, at the 
reporting date.
   Current income tax relating to items 
recognised outside proﬁt or loss is recognised 
outside proﬁt or loss (either in other 
comprehensive income or in equity). Current 
tax items are recognised in correlation to 
the underlying transaction either in OCI or 
directly in equity. Management periodically 
evaluates positions taken in the tax returns 
with respect to situations in which applicable 
tax regulations are subject to interpretation 
and considers whether it is probable that a 
taxation authority will accept an uncertain 
tax treatment. The Trust shall reﬂect the 
eﬀect of uncertainty for each uncertain tax 
treatment by using either most likely method 
or expected value method, depending on 
which method predicts better resolution of 
the treatment.
  Deferred tax
   Deferred tax is provided using the liability 
method on temporary diﬀerences between 
the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts for ﬁnancial 
reporting purposes at the reporting date.
   Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all 
taxable temporary diﬀerences, except:
  •  When the deferred tax liability arises 
from the initial recognition of goodwill 
or an asset or liability in a transaction 
that is not a business combination and, 
at the time of the transaction, aﬀects 
neither the accounting proﬁt nor 
taxable proﬁt or loss
  •  In respect of taxable temporary 
diﬀerences associated with investments 
in subsidiaries, associates and interests 
in joint ventures, when the timing of the

Trust Overview
reversal of the temporary diﬀerences 
can be controlled and it is probable 
that the temporary diﬀerences will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future
    Deferred tax assets are recognised for 
all deductible temporary diﬀerences, 
the carry forward of unused tax credits 
and any unused tax losses. Deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable proﬁt 
will be available against which the 
deductible temporary diﬀerences, and 
the carry forward of unused tax credits 
and unused tax losses can be utilised, 
except:
  •  When the deferred tax asset relating 
to the deductible temporary diﬀerence 
arises from the initial recognition of an 
asset or liability in a transaction that is 
not a business combination and, at the 
time of the transaction, aﬀects neither 
the accounting proﬁt nor taxable proﬁt 
or loss
  •  In respect of deductible temporary 
diﬀerences associated with investments 
in subsidiaries, associates and interests 
in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are 
recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that the temporary diﬀerences 
will reverse in the foreseeable future and 
taxable proﬁt will be available against 
which the temporary diﬀerences can be 
utilised
     The carrying amount of deferred tax 
assets is reviewed at each reporting 
date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that suﬃcient 
taxable proﬁt will be available to allow 
all or part of the deferred tax asset to 
be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax 
assets are re-assessed at each reporting 
date and are recognised to the extent 
that it has become probable that future 
taxable proﬁts will allow the deferred 
tax asset to be recovered.
    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the year when the 
asset is realised, or the liability is settled, 
based on tax rates (and tax laws) that 
have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date.
    Deferred tax relating to items 
recognised outside proﬁt or loss 
is recognised outside proﬁt or loss 
(either in other comprehensive income 
or in equity). Deferred tax items 
are recognised in correlation to the 
underlying transaction either in OCI or 
directly in equity.
    The Trust oﬀsets deferred tax assets 
and deferred tax liabilities if and only 
if it has a legally enforceable right to 
set oﬀ current tax assets and current 
tax liabilities and the deferred tax 
assets and deferred tax liabilities relate 
to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority on either the same 
taxable entity or diﬀerent taxable 
entities which intend either to settle 
current tax liabilities and assets on a 
net basis, or to realise the assets and 
settle the liabilities simultaneously, in 
each future period in which signiﬁcant 
amounts of deferred tax liabilities or 
assets are expected to be settled or 
recovered.
 2.8 Provisions
   Provisions are recognised when the Trust has 
a present obligation (legal or constructive) 
as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that an outﬂow of resources embodying 
economic beneﬁts will be required to settle 
the obligation and a reliable estimate can be 
made of the amount of the obligation. When 
the Trust expects some or all of a provision 
to be reimbursed, for example, under an 
insurance contract, the reimbursement is 
recognised as a separate asset, but only 
when the reimbursement is virtually certain. 
The expense relating to a provision is 
presented in the statement of proﬁt and loss 
net of any reimbursement.
Knowledge Realty Trust
RN: IN/REIT/24-25/0006
Condensed Standalone Financial Statements
Notes to the Condensed Standalone Financial Statements (Contd.)
156 Half Yearly Report FY 2025-26
   If the eﬀect of the time value of money is 
material, provisions are discounted using 
a current pre-tax rate that reﬂects, when 
appropriate, the risks speciﬁc to the liability. 
When discounting is used, the increase in 
the provision due to the passage of time is 
recognised as a ﬁnance cost.
 2.9 Operating segments
    The objective of the Trust is to undertake 
activities in accordance with the provisions 
of the SEBI REIT Regulations and the Trust 
Deed. The principal activity of the Trust is to 
own and invest in rent or income generating 
real estate and related assets in India.
    The Board of Directors of the Investment 
Manager allocate the resources and assess 
the performance of the Trust, thus are the 
Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). 
In accordance with the requirements of 
Ind AS 108 - “Segment Reporting”, the 
CODM monitors the operating results of 
the business. as a single segment, hence no 
separate segment needs to be disclosed. As 
the Trust operates only in India, no separate 
geographical segment is disclosed.
 2.10 Contingent Liabilities
   A contingent liability is a possible obligation 
that arises from past events whose existence 
will be conﬁrmed by the occurrence or non-
occurrence of one or more uncertain future 
events beyond the control of Trust or a 
present obligation that is not recognised 
because it is not probable that an outﬂow 
of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation. A contingent liability also arises in 
extremely rare cases where there is a liability 
that cannot be recognised because it cannot 
be measured reliably. The contingent liability 
is not recognised in the books of accounts 
but its existence is disclosed in the Financial 
Statements by way of notes to accounts, 
unless possibility of an outﬂow of resources 
embodying economic beneﬁt is remote.
 2.11 Financial Instruments
   A ﬁnancial instrument is any contract that 
gives rise to a ﬁnancial asset of one entity 
and a ﬁnancial liability or equity instrument 
of another entity.
  Financial assets
  Initial recognition and measurement
   Financial assets are classiﬁed, at initial 
recognition, as subsequently measured at 
amortised cost, fair value through other 
comprehensive income (OCI), and fair value 
through proﬁt or loss.
    The classiﬁcation of ﬁnancial assets at initial 
recognition depends on the ﬁnancial asset’s 
contractual cash ﬂow characteristics and the 
Trust’s business model for managing them. 
With the exception of trade receivables 
that do not contain a signiﬁcant ﬁnancing 
component or for which the Trust has applied 
the practical expedient, the Trust initially 
measures a ﬁnancial asset at its fair value 
plus, in the case of a ﬁnancial asset not at 
fair value through proﬁt or loss, transaction 
costs. Trade receivables that do not contain 
a signiﬁcant ﬁnancing component or for 
which the Trust has applied the practical 
expedient are measured at the transaction 
price determined under Ind AS 115.
   In order for a ﬁnancial asset to be classiﬁed 
and measured at amortised cost or fair value 
through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash 
ﬂows that are ‘solely payments of principal 
and interest (SPPI)’ on the principal amount 
outstanding. This assessment is referred 
to as the SPPI test and is performed at an 
instrument level. Financial assets with cash 
ﬂows that are not SPPI are classiﬁed and 
measured at fair value through proﬁt or loss, 
irrespective of the business model.
    The Trust’s business model for managing 
ﬁnancial assets refers to how it manages 
its ﬁnancial assets in order to generate 
cash ﬂows. The business model determines 
whether cash ﬂows will result from 
collecting contractual cash ﬂows, selling the 
ﬁnancial assets, or both. Financial assets 
classiﬁed and measured at amortised cost 
are held within a business model with the 
objective to hold ﬁnancial assets in order to 
collect contractual cash ﬂows while ﬁnancial 
assets classiﬁed and measured at fair value 
through OCI are held within a business

Trust Overview
model with the objective of both holding to 
collect contractual cash ﬂows and selling.
   Purchases or sales of ﬁnancial assets that 
require delivery of assets within a time frame 
established by regulation or convention in 
the marketplace (regular way trades) are 
recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date 
that the Trust commits to purchase or sell 
the asset.
  Subsequent measurement
   For purposes of subsequent measurement, 
ﬁnancial assets are classiﬁed in four 
categories:
  •  Financial assets at amortised cost (debt 
instruments)
  •  Financial assets at fair value through 
other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) 
with recycling of cumulative gains and 
losses (debt instruments)
  •  Financial assets designated at fair 
value through OCI with no recycling 
of cumulative gains and losses upon 
derecognition (equity instruments)
  •  Financial assets at fair value through 
proﬁt or loss
   Financial assets at amortised cost (debt 
instruments)
    A ‘ﬁnancial asset’ is measured at the 
amortised cost if both the following 
conditions are met:
  a)  The asset is held within a business 
model whose objective is to hold assets 
for collecting contractual cash ﬂows, 
and
  b)  Contractual terms of the asset give rise 
on speciﬁed dates to cash ﬂows that 
are solely payments of principal and 
interest (SPPI) on the principal amount 
outstanding.
   After initial measurement, such ﬁnancial 
assets are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the eﬀective interest 
rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is 
calculated by taking into account any 
discount or premium on acquisition and fees 
or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. 
The EIR amortisation is included in ﬁnance 
income in the proﬁt or loss. The losses 
arising from impairment are recognised in 
the proﬁt or loss.
    Financial assets at fair value through OCI 
(FVTOCI) (debt instruments)
   A ‘ﬁnancial asset’ is classiﬁed as at the 
FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are 
met:
  a)  The objective of the business model is 
achieved both by collecting contractual 
cash ﬂows and selling the ﬁnancial 
assets, and
  b)   The asset’s contractual cash ﬂows 
represent SPPI.
    Debt instruments included within the 
FVTOCI category are measured initially 
as well as at each reporting date at fair 
value. For debt instruments, at fair value 
through OCI, interest income, foreign 
exchange revaluation and impairment 
losses or reversals are recognised in the 
proﬁt or loss and computed in the same 
manner as for ﬁnancial assets measured 
at amortised cost. The remaining fair 
value changes are recognised in OCI. 
Upon derecognition, the cumulative 
fair value changes recognised in OCI 
is reclassiﬁed from the equity to proﬁt  
or loss.
    Financial assets designated at fair 
value through OCI (equity instruments)
    Upon initial recognition, the Trust can 
elect to classify irrevocably its equity 
investments as equity instruments 
designated at fair value through OCI 
when they meet the deﬁnition of equity 
under Ind AS 32 Financial Instruments: 
Presentation and are not held for 
trading. The classiﬁcation is determined 
on an instrument-by-instrument basis. 
Equity instruments which are held for 
trading and contingent consideration 
recognised by an acquirer in a business 
combination to which Ind AS 103 
applies are classiﬁed as at FVTPL.

    Gains and losses on these ﬁnancial 
assets are never recycled to proﬁt or 
loss. Dividends are recognised as other 
income in the statement of proﬁt and 
loss when the right of payment has 
been established, except when the 
Trust beneﬁts from such proceeds as 
a recovery of part of the cost of the 
ﬁnancial asset, in which case, such gains 
are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments 
designated at fair value through OCI are 
not subject to impairment assessment.
    Financial assets at fair value through 
proﬁt or loss
    Financial assets at fair value through 
proﬁt or loss are carried in the balance 
sheet at fair value with net changes in 
fair value recognised in the statement 
of proﬁt and loss.
    This category includes derivative 
instruments and listed equity 
investments which the Trust had not 
irrevocably elected to classify at fair 
value through OCI. Dividends on listed 
equity investments are recognised in the 
statement of proﬁt and loss when the 
right of payment has been established.
    Derecognition
    A ﬁnancial asset (or, where applicable, 
a part of a ﬁnancial asset or part of a 
group of similar ﬁnancial assets) is 
primarily derecognised (i.e. removed 
from the Trust’s standalone balance 
sheet) when:
   •  The rights to receive cash ﬂows 
from the asset have expired, or
   •  The Trust has transferred its 
rights to receive cash ﬂows from 
the asset or has assumed an 
obligation to pay the received 
cash ﬂows in full without material 
delay to a third party under a 
‘pass-through’ arrangement; and 
either (a) the Trust has transferred 
substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset, or (b) the 
Trust has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset.
    When the Trust has transferred its 
rights to receive cash ﬂows from 
an asset or has entered into a pass-
through arrangement, it evaluates if 
and to what extent it has retained the 
risks and rewards of ownership. When 
it has neither transferred nor retained 
substantially all of the risks and rewards 
of the asset, nor transferred control 
of the asset, the Trust continues to 
recognise the transferred asset to 
the extent of the Trust’s continuing 
involvement. In that case, the Trust also 
recognises an associated liability. The 
transferred asset and the associated 
liability are measured on a basis that 
reﬂects the rights and obligations that 
the Trust has retained.
    Continuing involvement that takes 
the form of a guarantee over the 
transferred asset is measured at the 
lower of the original carrying amount 
of the asset and the maximum amount 
of consideration that the Trust could be 
required to repay.
   Impairment of ﬁnancial assets
    The Trust recognises an allowance for 
expected credit losses (ECLs) for all 
debt instruments not held at fair value 
through proﬁt or loss. ECLs are based on 
the diﬀerence between the contractual 
cash ﬂows due in accordance with the 
contract and all the cash ﬂows that the 
Trust expects to receive, discounted 
at an approximation of the original 
eﬀective interest rate. The expected 
cash ﬂows will include cash ﬂows from 
the sale of collateral held or other credit 
enhancements that are integral to the 
contractual terms.
    ECLs are recognised in two stages. 
For credit exposures for which there 
has not been a signiﬁcant increase 
in credit risk since initial recognition,

Trust Overview
ECLs are provided for credit losses 
that result from default events that 
are possible within the next 12-months 
(a 12-month ECL). For those credit 
exposures for which there has been a 
signiﬁcant increase in credit risk since 
initial recognition, a loss allowance is 
required for credit losses expected 
over the remaining life of the exposure, 
irrespective of the timing of the default 
(a lifetime ECL).
    For trade receivables and contract 
assets, the Trust applies a simpliﬁed 
approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, 
the Trust does not track changes in 
credit risk, but instead recognises a 
loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs 
at each reporting date. The Trust has 
established a provision matrix that 
is based on its historical credit loss 
experience, adjusted for forward-
looking factors speciﬁc to the debtors 
and the economic environment.
    For debt instruments at fair value 
through OCI, the Trust applies the 
low credit risk simpliﬁcation. At every 
reporting date, the Trust evaluates 
whether the debt instrument is 
considered to have low credit risk 
using all reasonable and supportable 
information that is available without 
undue cost or eﬀort.
    It is the Trust’s policy to measure ECLs 
on such instruments on a 12-month 
basis. However, when there has been a 
signiﬁcant increase in credit risk since 
origination, the allowance will be based 
on the lifetime ECL.
   Financial liabilities
   Initial recognition and measurement
    Financial liabilities are classiﬁed, at initial 
recognition, as ﬁnancial liabilities at fair 
value through proﬁt or loss, loans and 
borrowings, payables, or as derivatives 
designated as hedging instruments in 
an eﬀective hedge, as appropriate.
    All ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised 
initially at fair value and, in the case of 
loans and borrowings and payables, 
net of directly attributable transaction 
costs.
   Subsequent measurement
    For purposes of subsequent 
measurement, ﬁnancial liabilities are 
classiﬁed in two categories:
   •   Financial liabilities at fair value 
through proﬁt or loss
   •   Financial liabilities at amortised 
cost (loans and borrowings)
    Financial liabilities at fair value through 
proﬁt or loss
    Financial liabilities at fair value through 
proﬁt or loss include ﬁnancial liabilities 
held for trading and ﬁnancial liabilities 
designated upon initial recognition as 
at fair value through proﬁt or loss.
    Financial liabilities are classiﬁed as 
held for trading if they are incurred 
for the purpose of repurchasing in the 
near term. This category also includes 
derivative ﬁnancial instruments entered 
into by the Trust that are not designated 
as hedging instruments in hedge 
relationships as deﬁned by Ind AS 
109. Separated embedded derivatives 
are also classiﬁed as held for trading 
unless they are designated as eﬀective 
hedging instruments.
    Gains or losses on liabilities held for 
trading are recognised in the proﬁt or 
loss.
    Financial liabilities designated upon 
initial recognition at fair value through 
proﬁt or loss are designated as such at 
the initial date of recognition, and only 
if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisﬁed. 
For liabilities designated as FVTPL, 
fair value gains/ losses attributable 
to changes in own credit risk are 
recognised in OCI. These gains/ losses 
are not subsequently transferred to

P&L. However, the Trust may transfer 
the cumulative gain or loss within 
equity. All other changes in fair value 
of such liability are recognised in the 
statement of proﬁt and loss. The Trust 
has not designated any ﬁnancial liability 
as at fair value through proﬁt or loss.
    Financial liabilities at amortised cost 
(Loans and borrowings)
    After initial recognition, interest-
bearing loans and borrowings are 
subsequently measured at amortised 
cost using the EIR method. Gains and 
losses are recognised in proﬁt or loss 
when the liabilities are derecognised 
as well as through the EIR amortisation 
process.
    Amortised cost is calculated by taking 
into account any discount or premium 
on acquisition and fees or costs that 
are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR 
amortisation is included as ﬁnance 
costs in the statement of proﬁt and loss.
   Financial guarantee contracts
    Financial guarantee contracts issued 
by the Trust are those contracts 
that require a payment to be made 
to reimburse the holder for a loss it 
incurs because the speciﬁed debtor 
fails to make a payment when due 
in accordance with the terms of a 
debt instrument. Financial guarantee 
contracts are recognised initially as 
a liability at fair value, adjusted for 
transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to the issuance of the 
guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is 
measured at the higher of the amount 
of loss allowance determined as per 
impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 
and the amount recognised less, when 
appropriate, the cumulative amount of 
income recognised in accordance with 
the principles of Ind AS 115.
   Derecognition
    A ﬁnancial liability is derecognised 
when the obligation under the liability 
is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing ﬁnancial liability is 
replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially diﬀerent terms, 
or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modiﬁed, such an 
exchange or modiﬁcation is treated 
as the derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new 
liability. The diﬀerence in the respective 
carrying amounts is recognised in the 
statement of proﬁt and loss.
   Reclassiﬁcation of ﬁnancial assets
    The Trust determines classiﬁcation of 
ﬁnancial assets and liabilities on initial 
recognition. After initial recognition, 
no reclassiﬁcation is made for ﬁnancial 
assets which are equity instruments 
and ﬁnancial liabilities. For ﬁnancial 
assets which are debt instruments, a 
reclassiﬁcation is made only if there 
is a change in the business model for 
managing those assets. Changes to 
the business model are expected to 
be infrequent. The senior management 
determines change in the business 
model as a result of external or internal 
changes which are signiﬁcant to the 
Trust’s operations. Such changes are 
evident to external parties. A change 
in the business model occurs when 
the Trust either begins or ceases to 
perform an activity that is signiﬁcant 
to its operations. If the Trust reclassiﬁes 
ﬁnancial assets, it applies the 
reclassiﬁcation prospectively from the 
reclassiﬁcation date which is the ﬁrst 
day of the immediately next reporting 
period following the change in business 
model. The Trust does not restate any 
previously recognised gains, losses 
(including impairment gains or losses) 
or interest.

Original 
classiﬁcation
Revised 
classiﬁcation
Accounting treatment
Amortised cost FVTPL Fair value is measured at reclassiﬁcation date. Diﬀerence 
between previous amortized cost and fair value is 
recognised in proﬁt or loss.
FVTPL Amortised Cost Fair value at reclassiﬁcation date becomes its new gross 
carrying amount. EIR is calculated based on the new 
gross carrying amount.
Amortised cost FVTOCI Fair value is measured at reclassiﬁcation date. 
Diﬀerence between previous amortised cost and fair 
value is recognised in OCI. No change in EIR due to 
reclassiﬁcation.
FVTOCI Amortised cost Fair value at reclassiﬁcation date becomes its new 
amortised cost carrying amount. However, cumulative 
gain or loss in OCI is adjusted against fair value. 
Consequently, the asset is measured as if it had always 
been measured at amortised cost.
FVTPL FVTOCI Fair value at reclassiﬁcation date becomes its new 
carrying amount. No other adjustment is required.
FVTOCI FVTPL Assets continue to be measured at fair value. Cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassiﬁed 
from equity to proﬁt or loss the reclassiﬁcation date.

 2.12 Oﬀsetting of ﬁnancial instruments
   Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities 
are oﬀset and the net amount is reported 
in the standalone balance sheet if there 
is a currently enforceable legal right to 
oﬀset the recognised amounts and there 
is an intention to settle on a net basis, to 
realise the assets and settle the liabilities 
simultaneously.
 2.13 Investment in SPVs
   The Trust has elected to recognise its 
investments in SPVs at cost in accordance 
with Ind AS 27, ‘Separate Financial 
Statements’. Investments in SPVs are 
reviewed for impairment, whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that 
carrying amount may not be recoverable.
 2.14 Unit Capital
   Units issued by the Trust are classiﬁed 
as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issuance of units are 
recognised as a deduction from equity, net 
of any tax eﬀects.
 2.15 Cash and cash equivalents
   Cash and cash equivalent in the balance 
sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand, 
cheques on hand and short-term deposits 
with an original maturity of three months 
or less, that are readily convertible to a 
known amount of cash and subject to an 
insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value.
 2.16 Distribution Policy
    The Net Distributable Cash Flows of Trust 
are based on the cash ﬂows generated from 
Trust’s assets and investments. In terms of 
the Distribution Policy of the Trust and the 
REIT Regulations, not less than 90% of the 
NDCF of each of the Asset SPVs is required 
to be distributed to the Trust, in proportion 
of Trust’s shareholding in the Asset SPV, 
subject to applicable provisions of the 
Companies Act 2013. Presently, NDCF to be 
received by the Trust from the Asset SPVs 
may be in the form of dividends, interest 
income, principal loan repayment, proceeds 
of any capital reduction or buyback from

under the Trust Deed or in such other form 
as may be permissible under the REIT 
Regulations. Such SPV Distributions shall 
be declared and made for every quarter of 
a Financial Year in terms of the Distribution 
Policy.
 2.17 Statement of net assets at fair value
   The disclosure of statement of Net Assets 
at Fair value is determined basis the fair 
values of the properties held by SPVs/
Investment Entity as well as book values of 
the total liabilities and other assets of the 
Trust and Asset SPVs. The fair value of the 
property held by SPVs/Investment Entity 
are reviewed semi-annually taking into 
consideration market conditions existing 
at the reporting date, and other generally 
accepted market practises.
 2.18 Cash distribution to Unitholders
   The Trust recognises a liability to make 
cash distributions to Unitholders when the 
distribution is authorised. As per the REIT 
Regulations, a distribution is authorised 
when it is approved by the Board of Directors 
of the Manager. A corresponding amount is 
recognised directly in equity.
 2.19 Statement of Cash ﬂows
   Cash ﬂows are reported using the indirect 
method, whereby net proﬁt before tax is 
adjusted for the eﬀects of transactions 
of a non-cash nature and any deferrals or 
accruals of past or future cash receipts or 
payments. The cash ﬂows from operating, 
investing and ﬁnancing activities of the 
Trust are segregated.
   For the purpose of the Statement of Cash 
Flow, cash and cash equivalents consist of 
cash at banks and on hand, cheques on hand 
and short-term deposits, as deﬁned above, 
net of outstanding bank/book overdrafts as 
they are considered an integral part of the 
Trust’s cash management.
 2.20 Earnings per unit
   Basic earnings per unit is calculated by 
dividing the net proﬁt or loss attributable 
to unit holders of the Trust by the weighted 
average number of units outstanding during 
the period.
   For the purpose of calculating diluted 
earnings per unit, the net proﬁt or loss for 
the period attributable to unitholders of the 
Trust and the weighted average number 
of units outstanding during the period 
are adjusted for the eﬀects of all dilutive 
potential units.
 2.21  Earnings before ﬁnance costs, depreciation, 
amortisation and tax (EBITDA)
    The Trust has elected to present EBITDA 
as a separate line item on the face of the 
Standalone Statement of Proﬁt and Loss. In 
its measurement, the Trust does not include 
ﬁnance costs, depreciation, amortisation 
and tax.

6 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT 
(i) Fair value hierarchy
  Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities measured at fair value in the ﬁnancial statements are grouped into 
three levels of a fair value hierarchy. The three levels are deﬁned based on the observability of signiﬁcant 
inputs to the measurement, as follows:
 Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for ﬁnancial instruments.
  Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly or indirectly.
 Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

3  Long term debt = Non-current borrowings (excluding current maturities of non-current debt and lease 
liabilities) + Interest accrued on debts (Non-current)
4 Working capital = Current asset - Current liabilities
5  Total debt = Non current borrowings (including current maturities of long term borrowings and

INTRODUCTION
1.  We have reviewed the accompanying 
unaudited condensed consolidated interim 
ﬁnancial statements of Knowledge Realty Trust  
(the “Trust”) and its subsidiaries (the Trust and its 
subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”), 
which comprise the unaudited condensed 
consolidated balance sheet as at September 30, 
2025, the unaudited condensed consolidated 
statement of proﬁt and loss, including other 
comprehensive income, unaudited condensed 
consolidated statement of cash ﬂows for the half 
year ended September 30, 2025, the unaudited 
condensed consolidated statement of changes 
in Unitholder’s equity and the unaudited 
statement of Net Distributable Cash Flows of 
the Trust and each of its subsidiaries for the half 
year ended September 30, 2025 and a summary 
of the material accounting policies and select 
explanatory information (together hereinafter 
referred to as the “Condensed Consolidated 
Interim Financial Statements”).
2.  The Manager is responsible for the preparation 
of the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial 
Statements in accordance with the Indian 
Accounting Standard 34 (Ind AS 34) “Interim 
Financial Reporting”, speciﬁed under Companies 
(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as 
amended, read with Securities and Exchange 
Board of India (Real Estate Investment Trusts) 
Regulations, 2014, as amended, including any 
guidelines and circulars issued thereunder 
(together referred as the “REIT Regulations”), 
and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India. The Condensed Consolidated 
Interim Financial Statements has been approved 
by the Board of Directors of the Manager. Our 
responsibility is to express a conclusion on the 
Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial

Independent Auditor’s Report 
on Review of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements
SCOPE OF REVIEW
3.  We conducted our review in accordance with 
the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 
2410, “Review of Interim Financial Information 
Performed by the Independent Auditor of the 
Entity” issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India. This standard requires 
that we plan and perform the review to 
obtain moderate assurance as to whether the 
Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial 
Statements is free of material misstatement. A 
review consists of making inquiries, primarily of 
persons responsible for ﬁnancial and accounting 
matters, and applying analytical and other 
review procedures. A review is substantially less 
in scope than an audit conducted in accordance 
with Standards on Auditing and consequently 
does not enable us to obtain assurance that we 
would become aware of all signiﬁcant matters 
that might be identiﬁed in an audit. Accordingly, 
we do not express an audit opinion.
4.  The Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial 
Statements includes the ﬁnancial information 
of the entities mentioned in Annexure 1 of  
this report.
CONCLUSION
5.  Based on our review conducted as above and 
based on the consideration of the review reports 
of the other auditors referred to in paragraph 7 
below, nothing has come to our attention that 
causes us to believe that the accompanying 
Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial 
Statements have not been prepared in all material 
respects in accordance with the requirements of 
Ind AS 34 read with REIT Regulations and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India.
EMPHASIS OF MATTER
6.  We draw attention to note 16 of the Condensed 
Consolidated Interim Financial Statements which 
describes the presentation/classiﬁcation of “Unit 
Capital” as “Equity” in order to comply with the 
requirements of the relevant REIT Regulations, 
instead of the applicable requirements of Ind AS 
32 – Financial Instruments: Presentation.
  Our conclu sion is not modiﬁed in respect of this 
matter.

 Notes:
 (i)  The Trust has not issued any units till March 31, 2025. Therefore, the disclosures in respect of NAV per 
unit as at March 31, 2025 not been disclosed.
 (ii) Measurement of fair values:
   The fair value of Speciﬁed assets$ have been determined by an independent external property valuer 
having appropriately recognised professional qualiﬁcations and recent experience in the location and 
category of the property being valued. Further, fair value of liabilities considered for computing the 
NAV equals the book value of such liabilities, except in case where the outﬂow arising out of the 
liabilities have already been considered by the valuer while computing the fair value of assets.
  Valuation technique:
   The valuer has followed a Discounted Cash Flow method. The valuation model considers the present 
value of net cash ﬂows to be generated from the respective properties, taking into account existing 
lease arrangements, expected rental growth rate, vacancy period, occupancy rate and lease incentive 
costs. The expected net cash ﬂows are discounted using the risk adjusted discount rates. Among other 
factors, the discount rate estimation considers the quality of a building and its location (prime vs 
secondary), tenant credit quality and lease terms.

2.  BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT 
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 2.1  Basis of preparation and Statement of 
Compliance
   The Consolidated Financial Statements 
has been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of SEBI (Real Estate 
Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014 as 
amended from time to time including any 
guidelines and circulars issued thereunder 
read with SEBI master circular no. SEBI/
HO/DDHS-PoD-2/P/CIR/2025/99 for real 
estate investment trusts dated July 11, 2025, 
(‘SEBI Master Circular’) and other circulars 
issued thereunder (‘REIT Regulations’); 
Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 34 
“Interim Financial Reporting”, as prescribed 
in Rule 2(1)(a) of the Companies (Indian 
Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (as 
amended) and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, to the extent 
not inconsistent with the REIT regulations.
   The Consolidated Financial Statements 
comprises the Condensed Consolidated 
Balance Sheet and as at September 
30, 2025, the Condensed Consolidated 
Statement of Proﬁt and Loss, including other 
comprehensive income, the Condensed 
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow, the 
Statement of Net Distributable Cashﬂows 
of Knowledge Realty Trust and each of 
the SPVs, the Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Unitholders’ Equity and a 
summary of material accounting policies 
and other explanatory information for the 
quarter and half year ended September 30, 
2025.
   The Consolidated Financial Statements 
have been prepared on going concern basis 
in accordance with accounting principles 
generally accepted in India. Further, the 
Consolidated Financial Statements have 
been prepared on the historical cost basis 
except for the accounting policies below. 
The accounting policies have been applied 
consistently over all the period presented in 
these Consolidated Financial Statements.
   All amounts disclosed in the Consolidated 
Financial Statements and notes have been 
rounded oﬀ to the nearest million as per the 
requirement of Schedule III, unless otherwise 
stated.
 2.2 Basis of consolidation
   The Consolidated Financial Statements 
comprise the ﬁnancial statements of the 
Group. Control is achieved when the Group 
is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns 
from its involvement with the investee and 
has the ability to aﬀect those returns through 
its power over the investee. Speciﬁcally, the 
Group controls an investee if and only if the 
Group has:
  •  Power over the investee (i.e. existing 
rights that give it the current ability 
to direct the relevant activities of the 
investee)
  •  Exposure, or rights, to variable returns 
from its involvement with the investee, 
and
  •  The ability to use its power over the 
investee to aﬀect its returns
  •  Generally, there is a presumption that 
a majority of voting rights result in 
Knowledge Realty Trust
RN: IN/REIT/24-25/0006
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements (Contd.)
196 Half Yearly Report FY 2025-26
control. To support this presumption 
and when the Group has less than a 
majority of the voting or similar rights 
of an investee, the Group considers 
all relevant facts and circumstances in 
assessing whether it has power over an 
investee, including:
  •  The contractual arrangement with the 
other vote holders of the investee
  •  Rights arising from other contractual 
arrangements
  •  The Group’s voting rights and potential 
voting rights
  •  The size of the group’s holding of 
voting rights relative to the size and 
dispersion of the holdings of the other 
voting rights holders
   The Group re-assesses whether or 
not it controls an investee if facts and 
circumstances indicate that there are 
changes to one or more of the three 
elements of control. Consolidation of a 
subsidiary begins when the Group obtains 
control over the subsidiary and ceases when 
the Group loses control of the subsidiary. 
Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of 
a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during 
the year are included in the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements from the date the 
Group gains control until the date the Group 
ceases to control the subsidiary.
   Consolidated Financial Statements are 
prepared using uniform accounting policies 
for like transactions and other events in 
similar circumstances. If a member of the 
Group uses accounting policies other than 
those adopted in the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements for like transactions and events 
in similar circumstances, appropriate 
adjustments are made to that Group 
member’s ﬁnancial statements in preparing 
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
to ensure conformity with the Group’s 
accounting policies.
   The ﬁnancial statements of all entities 
used for the purpose of consolidation are 
drawn up to same reporting date as that 
of the Trust. When the end of the reporting 
period of the Trust is diﬀerent from that 
of a subsidiary, the subsidiary prepares, 
for consolidation purposes, additional 
ﬁnancial information as of the same date 
as the ﬁnancial statements of the Trust to 
enable the Trust to consolidate the ﬁnancial 
information of the subsidiary, unless it is 
impracticable to do so.
  Consolidation procedure:
  •  Combine like items of assets, liabilities, 
equity, income, expenses and cash 
ﬂows of the Trust with those of its 
subsidiaries. For this purpose, income 
and expenses of the subsidiaries are 
based on the amounts of the assets and 
liabilities recognised in the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements at the acquisition 
date.
  •  Oﬀset (eliminate) the carrying amount 
of the Trust’s investment in each 
subsidiary and the Trust’s portion of 
equity of each subsidiary.
  •  Eliminate in full intragroup assets and 
liabilities, equity, income, expenses 
and cash ﬂows relating to transactions 
between entities of the group (proﬁts 
or losses resulting from intragroup 
transactions that are recognised in 
assets, such as inventory and ﬁxed 
assets, are eliminated in full). Intragroup 
losses may indicate an impairment that 
requires recognition in the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements. Ind AS 12 Income 
Taxes applies to temporary diﬀerences 
that arise from the elimination of proﬁts 
and losses resulting from intragroup 
transactions.
   When necessary, adjustments are made 
to the ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries 
to bring their accounting policies into 
line with the Group’s accounting policies. 
All intra-group assets and liabilities, 
equity, income, expenses and cash ﬂows 
relating to transactions between members 
of the Group are eliminated in full on 
consolidation.

Trust Overview
   A change in the ownership interest of a 
subsidiary, without a loss of control, is 
accounted for as an equity transaction. If 
the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:
  •  Derecognises the assets (including 
goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary 
at their carrying amounts at the date 
when control is lost
  •  Derecognises the carrying amount of 
any non-controlling interests
  •  Derecognises the cumulative translation 
diﬀerences recorded in equity
  •  Recognises the fair value of the 
consideration received
  •  Recognises the fair value of any 
investment retained
  •  Recognises any surplus or deﬁcit in 
proﬁt or loss
  •  Recognise that distribution of shares of 
subsidiary to Group in Group’s capacity 
as owners
   Reclassiﬁes the Trust’s share of components 
previously recognised in OCI to proﬁt or loss 
or transferred directly to retained earnings, 
if required by other Ind ASs as would be 
required if the Group had directly disposed 
of the related assets or liabilities.
 2.3  Summary of material accounting policies
  2.3.1 Business combination
    At the time of acquisition of assets and 
liabilities assumed, the Group evaluates 
whether the acquisition is a business 
combination or asset acquisition.
    The Group determines that it has 
acquired a business when the acquired 
set of activities and assets include an 
input and a substantive process that 
together signiﬁcantly contribute to the 
ability to create outputs. The acquired 
process is considered substantive if 
it is critical to the ability to continue 
producing outputs, and the inputs 
acquired include an organised workforce 
with the necessary skills, knowledge, or 
experience to perform that process or 
it signiﬁcantly contributes to the ability 
to continue producing outputs and is 
considered unique or scarce or cannot 
be replaced without signiﬁcant cost, 
eﬀort, or delay in the ability to continue 
producing outputs.
    Business combinations are accounted 
for using the acquisition method. The 
cost of an acquisition is measured as 
the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred measured at acquisition date 
fair value and the amount of any non-
controlling interests in the acquiree. For 
each business combination, the Group 
elects whether to measure the non-
controlling interests in the acquiree at 
fair value or at the proportionate share 
of the acquiree’s identiﬁable net assets. 
Acquisition-related costs are expensed 
as incurred.
    The Group has an option to apply 
a ‘concentration test’ that permits 
a simpliﬁed assessment of whether 
an acquired set of activities and 
assets is not a business. The optional 
concentration test is met if substantially 
all of the fair value of the gross assets 
acquired (net of cash and cash 
equivalents, deferred tax assets and 
goodwill from deferred tax liabilities) in 
a transaction is concentrated in a single 
identiﬁable asset or Group of similar 
identiﬁable assets.
    If the concentration test is met, the set 
of activities and assets is determined 
not to be a business and the Group 
identiﬁes and recognises the individual 
identiﬁable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed by allocating the 
purchase price ﬁrst to ﬁnancial assets/
ﬁnancial liabilities at the respective 
fair values, the remaining balance of 
the purchase price is then allocated 
to the other identiﬁable assets and 
liabilities on the basis of their relative 
fair values at the date of purchase. 
Such a transaction does not give rise to 
goodwill or bargain purchase gain.

  2.3.2 Use of judgements and estimates
    In the application of Knowledge 
Realty Trust’s accounting policies, 
the Management is required to make 
estimates and assumptions that aﬀect 
the reported amounts of assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses that 
are not readily apparent from other 
sources. The estimates and associated 
assumptions are based on historical 
experience and other factors that are 
considered to be relevant. Actual results 
may diﬀer from these estimates.
    The estimates and underlying 
assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimates are revised if the 
revision aﬀects only that period, or in 
the period of the revision and future 
periods if the revision aﬀects both 
current and future periods.
    The areas involving critical estimates or 
judgements are:
   -  Determining fair value of investment 
properties, including impairment 
assessment of investment 
properties and goodwill: The 
determination of the fair value of 
investment properties requires the 
use of estimates such as future 
cash ﬂows from the assets (such as 
market rent, market parking rent, 
rent growth rate, parking income 
growth rate, market lease tenure, 
market escalations, maintenance 
income prevailing in the market 
etc.) and discount rates applicable 
to those assets. These estimates 
are based on local market 
conditions existing at the balance 
sheet date. Impairment exists when 
the carrying value of an asset or 
cash generating unit exceeds its 
recoverable amount, which is the 
higher of its fair value less costs of 
disposal and its value in use. The 
value in use calculation is based 
on a discounted cashﬂow (‘DCF’) 
model. The cash ﬂows are derived 
from the budgets. The recoverable 
amount is sensitive to the discount 
rate used for the DCF model as 
well as the expected future cash-
inﬂows and the growth rate used 
for the purpose of determining fair 
values.
   -  Useful lives of investment property 
and property, plant and equipment: 
Management reviews its estimate 
of the useful lives of investment 
property and property, plant and 
equipment at each reporting date, 
based on the expected utility of 
the assets. Uncertainties in these 
estimates relate to technical and 
economic obsolescence that may 
change the utility of assets
   -  Assessment of lease term 
for revenue recognition: The 
management has considered lease 
term as the non-cancellable term 
of the lease, after considering all 
facts and circumstances including 
renewal, termination and market 
conditions.
   -  Deferred tax assets are recognised 
for unused tax losses and minimum 
alternate tax (MAT) credit, to the 
extent that it is probable that 
taxable proﬁt will be available 
against which the losses/ MAT 
credit can be utilised. Signiﬁcant 
management judgement is 
required to determine the amount 
of deferred tax assets that can 
be recognised, based upon the 
likely timing and the level of future 
taxable proﬁts together with future 
tax planning strategies.
   -  Assessment of acquisition as 
business combination vs asset 
acquisition and applying the 
concentration test.

Trust Overview
    Detailed information about each of 
these estimates and judgements is 
included in relevant notes together 
with information about the basis of 
calculation for each aﬀected line item in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
    Estimates and judgement are continually 
evaluated. They are based on historical 
experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that may 
have a ﬁnancial impact on Knowledge 
Realty Trust and that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances.
  2.3.3  Current versus non-current classiﬁcation
    The Group presents assets and liabilities 
in the balance sheet based on current /
non-current classiﬁcation.
   An asset is treated as current when it is:
   •  Expected to be realised or intended 
to be sold or consumed in normal 
operating cycle
   •  Held primarily for the purpose of 
trading
   •  Expected to be realised within 
twelve months after the reporting 
period, or
   •  Cash or cash equivalent unless 
restricted from being exchanged or 
used to settle a liability for at least 
twelve months after the reporting 
period
     All other assets are classiﬁed as non-
current.
   A liability is current when:
   •  It is expected to be settled in 
normal operating cycle
   •  It is held primarily for the purpose 
of trading
   •  It is due to be settled within twelve 
months after the reporting period, 
or
   •  There is no unconditional right to 
defer the settlement of the liability 
for at least twelve months after the 
reporting period
    The terms of the liability that could, 
at the option of the counterparty, 
result in its settlement by the issue of 
equity instruments do not aﬀect its 
classiﬁcation.
    The Group classiﬁes all other liabilities 
as non-current.
    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
classiﬁed as non-current assets and 
liabilities.
    The operating cycle is the time between 
the acquisition of assets for processing 
and their realisation in cash and cash 
equivalents. The Group has identiﬁed 
twelve months as its operating cycle.
   Foreign currencies
    The Consolidated Financial Statements 
are presented in `, which is also the 
Trust company’s functional currency. 
For each entity the Group determines 
the functional currency and items 
included in the ﬁnancial statements of 
each entity are measured using that 
functional currency.
    Transactions and balances
    Transactions in foreign currencies are 
initially recorded by the Group’s entities 
at their respective functional currency 
spot rates at the date the transaction 
ﬁrst qualiﬁes for recognition. However, 
for practical reasons, the Group 
uses average rate if the average 
approximates the actual rate at the 
date of the transaction.
    Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated at the functional currency 
spot rates of exchange at the reporting 
date.
    Exchange diﬀerences arising on 
settlement or translation of monetary 
items are recognised in proﬁt or loss.
    Non-monetary items that are measured 
in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency are translated using the 
exchange rates at the dates of the 
Knowledge Realty Trust
RN: IN/REIT/24-25/0006
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements (Contd.)
200 Half Yearly Report FY 2025-26
initial transactions. Non-monetary 
items measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are translated using the 
exchange rates at the date when the 
fair value is determined. The gain or loss 
arising on translation of non-monetary 
items measured at fair value is treated 
in line with the recognition of the gain 
or loss on the change in fair value of 
the item (i.e., translation diﬀerences on 
items whose fair value gain or loss is 
recognised in OCI or proﬁt or loss are 
also recognised in OCI or proﬁt or loss, 
respectively).
    In determining the spot exchange rate to 
use on initial recognition of the related 
asset, expense or income (or part of it) 
on the derecognition of a non-monetary 
asset or non-monetary liability relating 
to advance consideration, the date of 
the transaction is the date on which 
the Group initially recognises the 
non-monetary asset or non-monetary 
liability arising from the advance 
consideration. If there are multiple 
payments or receipts in advance, the 
Group determines the transaction date 
for each payment or receipt of advance 
consideration.
  2.3.4 Fair value measurement
     The Group measures certain ﬁnancial 
instruments, such as, derivatives at fair 
value at each balance sheet date.
    Fair value is the price that would 
be received to sell an asset or 
paid to transfer a liability in an 
orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. 
The fair value measurement is based on 
the presumption that the transaction 
to sell the asset or transfer the liability 
takes place either:
   •  In the principal market for the asset 
or liability, or
   •  In the absence of a principal 
market, in the most advantageous 
market for the asset or liability
     The principal or the most advantageous 
market must be accessible by the 
Group.
     The fair value of an asset or a liability 
is measured using the assumptions that 
market participants would use when 
pricing the asset or liability, assuming 
that market participants act in their 
economic best interest.
    A fair value measurement of a non-
ﬁnancial asset takes into account a 
market participant’s ability to generate 
economic beneﬁts by using the asset 
in its highest and best use or by selling 
it to another market participant that 
would use the asset in its highest and 
best use.
    The Group uses valuation techniques 
that are appropriate in the 
circumstances and for which suﬃcient 
data are available to measure fair 
value, maximising the use of relevant 
observable inputs and minimising the 
use of unobservable inputs.
    All assets and liabilities for which fair 
value is measured or disclosed in the 
ﬁnancial statements are categorised 
within the fair value hierarchy, described 
as follows, based on the lowest level 
input that is signiﬁcant to the fair value 
measurement as a whole:
   •  Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) 
market prices in active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities
   •  Level 2 — Valuation techniques 
for which the lowest level input 
that is signiﬁcant to the fair 
value measurement is directly or 
indirectly observable
   •  Level 3 — Valuation techniques 
for which the lowest level input 
that is signiﬁcant to the fair value 
measurement is unobservable
     For assets and liabilities that are 
recognised in the ﬁnancial statements on 
a recurring basis, the Group determines 
whether transfers have occurred 
Knowledge Realty Trust
RN: IN/REIT/24-25/0006
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements (Contd.)
Financial StatementsStatutory Reports
Knowledge Realty Trust 201
Trust Overview
between levels in the hierarchy by re-
assessing categorisation (based on the 
lowest level input that is signiﬁcant to 
the fair value measurement as a whole) 
at the end of each reporting period.
    The Group’s management determines 
the policies and procedures for both 
recurring fair value measurement, 
such as derivative instruments and 
unquoted ﬁnancial assets measured 
at fair value, and for non-recurring 
measurement, such as assets held for 
sale in discontinued operations.
    At each reporting date, the Management 
analyses the movements in the values of 
assets and liabilities which are required 
to be remeasured or re-assessed as per 
the Group’s accounting policies.
    For the purpose of fair value disclosures, 
the Group has determined classes of 
assets and liabilities on the basis of the 
nature, characteristics and risks of the 
asset or liability and the level of the fair 
value hierarchy as explained above.
  2.3.5 Revenue from Operations
   Revenue from lease rentals
    Leases in which the Group does not 
transfer substantially all the risks and 
rewards incidental to ownership of an 
asset are classiﬁed as operating leases. 
Rental income arising is accounted for 
on a straight-line basis over the lock-
in term. Initial direct costs incurred in 
negotiating and arranging an operating 
lease are added to the carrying amount 
of the leased asset and recognised over 
the lock-in term on the same basis as 
rental income. Contingent rents are 
recognised as revenue in the period in 
which they are earned.
   Revenue from contracts with customers
    Revenue is recognised upon transfer of 
control of promised goods or services 
to customer in an amount that reﬂects 
the consideration Knowledge Realty 
Trust expects to receive in exchange for 
those goods or services.
    Revenue is measured at the amount of 
transaction price. This involves inter alia 
discounting of the consideration due to 
the present value if payment extends 
beyond normal credit terms. Revenue 
is recognised when recovery of the 
consideration is probable, and the 
amount of revenue can be measured 
reliably.
   •  Revenue from contract with 
customers majorly include income 
from maintenance services. 
Revenue is recognised as and when 
the services are rendered based 
on the terms of the contracts. 
Knowledge Realty Trust collects 
goods and service tax on behalf of 
the government and therefore, it is 
not an economic beneﬁt ﬂowing to 
Knowledge Realty Trust. Hence, it is 
excluded from revenue. Knowledge 
Realty Trust raises invoices as per 
the terms of the contract, upon 
which the payment is due to be 
made by the customers.
     If the consideration in a contract 
includes a variable amount (like 
volume rebates /incentives, cash 
discounts etc.), Knowledge Realty 
Trust estimates the amount of 
consideration to which it will be 
entitled in exchange for rendering 
the services to the customer. 
The variable consideration is 
estimated at contract inception 
and constrained until it is highly 
probable that a signiﬁcant revenue 
reversal in the amount of cumulative 
revenue recognised will not occur 
when the associated uncertainty 
with the variable consideration 
is subsequently resolved. The 
estimate of variable consideration 
for expected future volume rebates/
incentives, cash discounts etc. are 
made on the most likely amount 
method. Revenue is disclosed net 
of such amounts.

Revenue from sale of power is 
recognised net of cash discount 
over time for each unit of electricity 
delivered at the contracted rate.
   Contract balances
   Contract assets
    A contract asset is the right to 
consideration in exchange for goods 
or services transferred to the customer. 
If Group performs its obligation by 
transferring goods or services to a 
customer before the customer pays 
consideration or before payment is due, 
a contract asset is recognised for the 
earned consideration that is conditional.
   Trade receivables
    A receivable (whether billed or unbilled) 
represents Group’s right to an amount 
of consideration that is unconditional 
(i.e., only the passage of time is required 
before payment of the consideration  
is due).
   Contract liabilities
    A contract liability is the obligation 
to transfer goods or services to a 
customer for which Group has received 
consideration (or an amount of 
consideration is due) from the customer. 
If a customer pays consideration before 
Group transfers goods or services to 
the customer, a contract liability is 
recognised when the payment is made 
or the payment is due (whichever 
is earlier). Contract liabilities are 
recognised as revenue when Group 
performs its obligations under the 
contract.
  2.3.6  Dividend income and Interest income
    Dividend income is recognised in the 
statement of proﬁt and loss on the 
date on which Group’s right to receive 
payment is established.
    Interest income is recognised using 
the eﬀective interest method. The 
‘eﬀective interest rate’ is the rate that 
exactly discounts estimated future cash 
receipts through the expected life of 
the ﬁnancial instrument to the gross 
carrying amount of the ﬁnancial asset.
    In calculating interest income, the 
eﬀective interest rate is applied to the 
gross carrying amount of the asset 
(when the asset is not credit-impaired). 
However, for ﬁnancial assets that have 
become credit-impaired subsequent 
to initial recognition, interest income 
is calculated by applying the eﬀective 
interest rate to the amortised cost of 
the ﬁnancial asset.
  2.3.7 Taxes
   • Current income tax
     Current income tax assets and 
liabilities are measured at the 
amount expected to be recovered 
from or paid to the taxation 
authorities. The tax rates and 
tax laws used to compute the 
amount are those that are enacted 
or substantively enacted, at the 
reporting date.
     Current income tax relating to 
items recognised outside proﬁt or 
loss is recognised outside proﬁt or 
loss (either in other comprehensive 
income or in equity). Current tax 
items are recognised in correlation 
to the underlying transaction 
either in OCI or directly in 
equity. Management periodically 
evaluates positions taken in the tax 
returns with respect to situations 
in which applicable tax regulations 
are subject to interpretation and 
considers whether it is probable 
that a taxation authority will 
accept an uncertain tax treatment. 
The Group shall reﬂect the eﬀect 
of uncertainty for each uncertain 
tax treatment by using either most 
likely method or expected value 
method, depending on which 
method predicts better resolution 
of the treatment.

Trust Overview
   • Deferred tax
     Deferred tax is provided using 
the liability method on temporary 
diﬀerences between the tax bases 
of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts for ﬁnancial 
reporting purposes at the reporting 
date.
     Deferred tax liabilities are 
recognised for all taxable 
temporary diﬀerences, except:
   •  When the deferred tax liability 
arises from the initial recognition of 
goodwill or an asset or liability in 
a transaction that is not a business 
combination and, at the time of 
the transaction, aﬀects neither the 
accounting proﬁt nor taxable proﬁt 
or loss.
   •  In respect of taxable temporary 
diﬀerences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries, 
associates and interests in joint 
ventures, when the timing of 
the reversal of the temporary 
diﬀerences can be controlled and 
it is probable that the temporary 
diﬀerences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
       Deferred tax assets are recognised 
for all deductible temporary 
diﬀerences, the carry forward of 
unused tax credits and any unused 
tax losses. Deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable proﬁt will 
be available against which the 
deductible temporary diﬀerences, 
and the carry forward of unused 
tax credits and unused tax losses 
can be utilised, except:
    •  When the deferred tax asset 
relating to the deductible 
temporary diﬀerence arises from 
the initial recognition of an asset 
or liability in a transaction that is 
not a business combination and, at 
the time of the transaction, aﬀects 
neither the accounting proﬁt nor 
taxable proﬁt or loss
   •  In respect of deductible temporary 
diﬀerences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries, 
associates and interests in joint 
ventures, deferred tax assets are 
recognised only to the extent that 
it is probable that the temporary 
diﬀerences will reverse in the 
foreseeable future and taxable 
proﬁt will be available against 
which the temporary diﬀerences 
can be utilised.
      The carrying amount of deferred tax 
assets is reviewed at each reporting 
date and reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that suﬃcient 
taxable proﬁt will be available to allow 
all or part of the deferred tax asset to 
be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax 
assets are re-assessed at each reporting 
date and are recognised to the extent 
that it has become probable that future 
taxable proﬁts will allow the deferred 
tax asset to be recovered.
    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the year when the 
asset is realised, or the liability is settled, 
based on tax rates (and tax laws) that 
have been enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date.
    Deferred tax relating to items 
recognised outside proﬁt or loss 
is recognised outside proﬁt or loss 
(either in other comprehensive income 
or in equity). Deferred tax items 
are recognised in correlation to the 
underlying transaction either in OCI or 
directly in equity.
    Tax beneﬁts acquired as part of a 
business combination, but not satisfying 
the criteria for separate recognition at 
that date, are recognised subsequently 
if new information about facts and 
circumstances change. Acquired 
deferred tax beneﬁts recognised

within the measurement period reduce 
goodwill related to that acquisition 
if they result from new information 
obtained about facts and circumstances 
existing at the acquisition date. If the 
carrying amount of goodwill is zero, 
any remaining deferred tax beneﬁts 
are recognised in OCI/ capital reserve 
depending on the principle explained 
for bargain purchase gains. All other 
acquired tax beneﬁts realised are 
recognised in proﬁt or loss.
    The Group oﬀsets deferred tax assets 
and deferred tax liabilities if and only 
if it has a legally enforceable right to 
set oﬀ current tax assets and current 
tax liabilities and the deferred tax 
assets and deferred tax liabilities relate 
to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority on either the same 
taxable entity or diﬀerent taxable 
entities which intend either to settle 
current tax liabilities and assets on a 
net basis, or to realise the assets and 
settle the liabilities simultaneously, in 
each future period in which signiﬁcant 
amounts of deferred tax liabilities or 
assets are expected to be settled or 
recovered.
  2.3.8  Property, plant and equipment
    Property, plant and equipment are carried 
at cost of acquisition or construction 
less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
Such cost includes the cost of replacing 
part of the plant and equipment 
and borrowing costs for long-term 
construction projects if the recognition 
criteria are met. The cost of property, 
plant and equipment includes freight, 
duties, taxes and other incidental 
expenses related to the acquisition or 
construction of the respective assets. 
The cost of such assets not ready for 
their intended use are disclosed as 
capital work-in-progress.
    If signiﬁcant parts of an item of property, 
plant and equipment have diﬀerent 
useful lives, then they are accounted for 
as separate items (major components) 
of property, plant and equipment.
    Subsequent expenditure is capitalised 
only if it is probable that the future 
economic beneﬁts associated with the 
expenditure will ﬂow to Knowledge 
Realty Trust and the cost of the item 
can be measured reliably.
   Derecognition
    The gain or loss arising on disposal 
of property, plant and equipment is 
determined by comparing the proceeds 
from disposal with the carrying amount 
of property, plant and equipment which 
is recognised in the statement of proﬁt 
and loss in the year of occurrence.
    An item of property, plant and 
equipment and any signiﬁcant part 
initially recognised is derecognised 
upon disposal or when no future 
economic beneﬁts are expected from 
its use or disposal. Any gain or loss 
arising on derecognition of the asset 
(calculated as the diﬀerence between 
the net disposal proceeds and carrying 
amount of the asset) is included in the 
statement of proﬁt and loss when the 
asset is derecognised.
    The management believes that its 
estimates of useful lives as given below 
best represent the period over which 
management expects to use these 
assets.
   Depreciation
    Depreciable amount is the cost of the 
assets or other amount substituted for 
cost, less its estimated residual value.
    Depreciation is calculated on the 
depreciable amount of property, plant 
and equipment calculated as per the 
depreciation method followed by 
the respective components over the

estimated useful lives mentioned below 
and is recognised in the statement 
of proﬁt and loss. The components 
management based on its best 
estimates follow either straight line 
method or written down value method 
for depreciating property, plant and 
equipment.
   Subsequent measurement
    Property, plant and equipment are 
subsequently measured at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, if any. Depreciation 
on property, plant and equipment is 
provided on the basis of useful lives as 
set out below:
    The estimated useful lives, residual 
values and depreciation method are 
reviewed at the end of each reporting 
period, with the eﬀect of any changes in 
estimate accounted for on a prospective 
basis.
    Estimated useful lives of the items of 
property, plant and equipment are as 
follows:
Type of asset Estimated 
Useful Lives  
(In years)
Buildings 10-75
Furniture and 
ﬁxtures
8-15
Oﬃce Equipments 3-20
Vehicles 6-20
Computers 3-6
Plant and Machinery 15
Electrical 
installations

  2.3.9 Investment properties
    Investment properties are measured 
initially at cost, including transaction 
costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
investment properties are stated at 
cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment loss, if any.
    The cost includes the cost of replacing 
parts and borrowing costs for long-term 
construction projects if the recognition 
criteria are met. When signiﬁcant 
parts of the investment properties are 
required to be replaced at intervals, 
the Group depreciates them separately 
based on their speciﬁc useful lives. All 
other repair and maintenance costs are 
recognised in proﬁt or loss as incurred.
    Depreciation is calculated on a straight-
line basis over the estimated useful lives 
of the assets as follows:
Type of asset Estimated 
Useful Lives  
(In years)
Buildings 9 to 75 years
Leasehold land Primary lease 
period
Plant and Machinery 3-20
Furniture and 
ﬁxtures
10-15
Oﬃce Equipment 5-20
Computers 3-6
Electrical 
installations
10-20
    The Group, based on technical 
assessment made by technical expert 
and management estimate, depreciates 
the building over estimated useful lives 
which are diﬀerent from the useful 
life prescribed in Schedule II to the 
Companies Act, 2013. The management 
believes that these estimated useful 
lives are realistic and reﬂect fair 
approximation of the period over which 
the assets are likely to be used.
    Investment properties are derecognised 
either when they have been disposed 
of or when they are permanently 
withdrawn from use and no future 
economic beneﬁt is expected from 
their disposal. The diﬀerence between 
the net disposal proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset is 
recognised in proﬁt or loss in the 
period of derecognition. In determining 
the amount of consideration from the 
derecognition of investment properties

the Group considers the eﬀects of 
variable consideration, existence of a 
signiﬁcant ﬁnancing component, non-
cash consideration, and consideration 
payable to the buyer (if any).
    Transfers are made to (or from) 
investment properties only when there 
is a change in use. Transfers between 
investment property, owner-occupied 
property and inventories do not change 
the carrying amount of the property 
transferred and they do not change the 
cost of that property for measurement 
or disclosure purposes.
  2.3.10Intangible assets
    Intangible assets acquired separately 
are measured on initial recognition 
at cost. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost 
less any accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses. 
Internally generated intangibles, 
excluding capitalised development 
costs, are not capitalised and the related 
expenditure is reﬂected in proﬁt or loss 
in the period in which the expenditure is 
incurred.
    The useful lives of intangible assets are 
assessed as either ﬁnite or indeﬁnite.
    Intangible assets with ﬁnite lives are 
amortised over the useful economic life 
and assessed for impairment whenever 
there is an indication that the intangible 
asset may be impaired. The amortisation 
period and the amortisation method 
for an intangible asset with a ﬁnite 
useful life are reviewed at least at the 
end of each reporting period. Changes 
in the expected useful life or the 
expected pattern of consumption of 
future economic beneﬁts embodied 
in the asset are considered to modify 
the amortisation period or method, 
as appropriate, and are treated as 
changes in accounting estimates. The 
amortisation expense on intangible 
assets with ﬁnite lives is recognised in 
the statement of proﬁt and loss unless 
such expenditure forms part of carrying 
value of another asset.
    Intangible assets with indeﬁnite 
useful lives are not amortised, but are 
tested for impairment annually, either 
individually or at the cash-generating 
unit level. The assessment of indeﬁnite 
life is reviewed annually to determine 
whether the indeﬁnite life continues 
to be supportable. If not, the change 
in useful life from indeﬁnite to ﬁnite is 
made on a prospective basis.
    Depreciation is calculated on a straight-
line basis over the estimated useful lives 
of the intangible assets as follows:
Type of asset Estimated Useful 
Lives (In years)
Software 3
    An intangible asset is derecognised 
upon disposal (i.e., at the date the 
recipient obtains control) or when no 
future economic beneﬁts are expected 
from its use or disposal. Any gain or 
loss arising upon derecognition of the 
asset (calculated as the diﬀerence 
between the net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset) is 
included in the statement of proﬁt and 
loss when the asset is derecognised.
  2.3.13Borrowing costs
     Borrowing costs directly attributable 
to the acquisition, construction or 
production of an asset that necessarily 
takes a substantial period of time to 
get ready for its intended use or sale 
are capitalised as part of the cost of 
the asset. All other borrowing costs 
are expensed in the period in which 
they occur. Borrowing costs consist of 
interest and other costs that an entity 
incurs in connection with the borrowing 
of funds. Borrowing cost also includes 
exchange diﬀerences to the extent 
regarded as an adjustment to the 
borrowing costs.

Trust Overview
  2.3.14 Leases
    The Group assesses at contract 
inception whether a contract is, or 
contains, a lease. That is, if the contract 
conveys the right to control the use of 
an identiﬁed asset for a period of time 
in exchange for consideration.
   Group as a lessee
    The Group applies a single recognition 
and measurement approach for all 
leases, except for short-term leases 
and leases of low-value assets. The 
Group recognises lease liabilities to 
make lease payments and right-of-use 
assets representing the right to use the 
underlying assets.
   i.  Right-of-use assets
     The Group recognises right-of-
use assets at the commencement 
date of the lease (i.e., the date 
the underlying asset is available 
for use). Right-of-use assets 
are measured at cost, less any 
accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, and adjusted 
for any remeasurement of lease 
liabilities. The cost of right-of-
use assets includes the amount of 
lease liabilities recognised, initial 
direct costs incurred, and lease 
payments made at or before the 
commencement date less any 
lease incentives received. Right-
of-use assets are depreciated on a 
straight-line basis over the shorter 
of the lease term and the estimated 
useful lives of the assets, as follows:
Type of asset Estimated Useful 
Lives (In years)
Plant and 
machinery
3 to 15 years
Building 3 to 5 years
     If ownership of the leased asset 
transfers to the Group at the end of 
the lease term or the cost reﬂects 
the exercise of a purchase option, 
depreciation is calculated using the 
estimated useful life of the asset.
   ii.  Lease liabilities
     At the commencement date of the 
lease, the Group recognises lease 
liabilities measured at the present 
value of lease payments to be 
made over the lease term. The lease 
payments include ﬁxed payments 
(including in substance ﬁxed 
payments) less any lease incentives 
receivable, variable lease payments 
that depend on an index or a rate, 
and amounts expected to be paid 
under residual value guarantees. 
The lease payments also include the 
exercise price of a purchase option 
reasonably certain to be exercised 
by the Group and payments of 
penalties for terminating the lease, 
if the lease term reﬂects the Group 
exercising the option to terminate. 
Variable lease payments that do 
not depend on an index or a rate 
are recognised as expenses (unless 
they are incurred to produce 
inventories) in the period in which 
the event or condition that triggers 
the payment occurs.
     In calculating the present value of 
lease payments, the Group uses its 
incremental borrowing rate at the 
lease commencement date because 
the interest rate implicit in the 
lease is not readily determinable. 
After the commencement date, 
the amount of lease liabilities is 
increased to reﬂect the accretion 
of interest and reduced for the 
lease payments made. In addition, 
the carrying amount of lease 
liabilities is remeasured if there 
is a modiﬁcation, a change in 
the lease term, a change in the 
lease payments (e.g., changes to 
future payments resulting from a 
change in an index or rate used to 
determine such lease payments) or 
a change in the assessment of an 
option to purchase the underlying 
asset.

Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements (Contd.)
208 Half Yearly Report FY 2025-26
   iii.  Short-term leases and leases of 
low-value assets
     The Group applies the short-term 
lease recognition exemption to its 
short-term leases of machinery 
and equipment (i.e., those leases 
that have a lease term of 12 months 
or less from the commencement 
date and do not contain a purchase 
option). It also applies the lease 
of low-value assets recognition 
exemption to leases of oﬃce 
equipment that are considered to 
be low value. Lease payments on 
short-term leases and leases of 
low-value assets are recognised 
as expense on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term.
  2.3.15  Impairment of non-ﬁnancial assets
    The Group assesses, at each reporting 
date, whether there is an indication 
that an asset may be impaired. If 
any indication exists, or when annual 
impairment testing for an asset is 
required, the Group estimates the 
asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s 
recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) 
fair value less costs of disposal and its 
value in use. The recoverable amount 
is determined for an individual asset, 
unless the asset does not generate cash 
inﬂows that are largely independent of 
those from other assets or groups of 
assets. When the carrying amount of an 
asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable 
amount, the asset is considered 
impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount.
    In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash ﬂows are discounted to 
their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reﬂects current 
market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks speciﬁc to 
the asset. In determining fair value 
less costs of disposal, recent market 
transactions are taken into account. If 
no such transactions can be identiﬁed, 
an appropriate valuation model is used. 
These calculations are corroborated by 
valuation multiples, quoted share prices 
for publicly traded companies or other 
available fair value indicators.
    The Group bases its impairment 
calculation on detailed budgets 
and forecast calculations, which are 
prepared separately for each of the 
Group’s CGUs to which the individual 
assets are allocated. These budgets and 
forecast calculations generally cover a 
period of ﬁve years. For longer periods, 
a long-term growth rate is calculated 
and applied to project future cash 
ﬂows after the ﬁfth year. To estimate 
cash ﬂow projections beyond periods 
covered by the most recent budgets/
forecasts, the Group extrapolates 
cash ﬂow projections in the budget 
using a steady or declining growth 
rate for subsequent years, unless an 
increasing rate can be justiﬁed. In any 
case, this growth rate does not exceed 
the long-term average growth rate for 
the products, industries, or country or 
countries in which the Group operates, 
or for the market in which the asset  
is used.
    Impairment losses of continuing 
operations, including impairment on 
inventories, are recognised in the 
statement of proﬁt and loss, except 
for properties previously revalued with 
the revaluation surplus taken to OCI. 
For such properties, the impairment is 
recognised in OCI up to the amount of 
any previous revaluation surplus.
    For assets excluding goodwill, an 
assessment is made at each reporting 
date to determine whether there is an 
indication that previously recognised 
impairment losses no longer exist or 
have decreased. If such indication 
exists, the Group estimates the asset’s 
or CGU’s recoverable amount. A 
previously recognised impairment 
loss is reversed only if there has been 
a change in the assumptions used 
to determine the asset’s recoverable 
amount since the last impairment loss

Trust Overview
was recognised. The reversal is limited 
so that the carrying amount of the asset 
does not exceed its recoverable amount, 
nor exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined, net of 
depreciation, had no impairment loss 
been recognised for the asset in prior 
years. Such reversal is recognised in the 
statement of proﬁt and loss unless the 
asset is carried at a revalued amount, in 
which case, the reversal is treated as a 
revaluation increase.
     Goodwill is tested for impairment 
annually and when circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may be 
impaired.
    Impairment is determined for goodwill 
by assessing the recoverable amount 
of each CGU (or group of CGUs) to 
which the goodwill relates. When the 
recoverable amount of the CGU is less 
than it’s carrying amount, an impairment 
loss is recognised. Impairment losses 
relating to goodwill cannot be reversed 
in future periods.
    Intangible assets with indeﬁnite useful 
lives are tested for impairment annually 
at the CGU level, as appropriate, and 
when circumstances indicate that the 
carrying value may be impaired.
  2.3.16  Provisions and contingent liabilities
    • General
     Provisions are recognised when 
the Group has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of 
a past event, it is probable that an 
outﬂow of resources embodying 
economic beneﬁts will be required 
to settle the obligation and a 
reliable estimate can be made 
of the amount of the obligation. 
When the Group expects some or 
all of a provision to be reimbursed, 
for example, under an insurance 
contract, the reimbursement is 
recognised as a separate asset, 
but only when the reimbursement 
is virtually certain. The expense 
relating to a provision is presented 
in the statement of proﬁt and loss 
net of any reimbursement.
    If the eﬀect of the time value of money 
is material, provisions are discounted 
using a current pre-tax rate that reﬂects, 
when appropriate, the risks speciﬁc to 
the liability. When discounting is used, 
the increase in the provision due to 
the passage of time is recognised as a 
ﬁnance cost.
  • Onerous contracts
    If the Group has a contract that is 
onerous, the present obligation under the 
contract is recognised and measured as 
a provision. However, before a separate 
provision for an onerous contract is 
established, the Group recognises any 
impairment loss that has occurred on 
assets dedicated to that contract.
    An onerous contract is a contract under 
which the unavoidable costs (i.e., the 
costs that the Group cannot avoid 
because it has the contract) of meeting 
the obligations under the contract 
exceed the economic beneﬁts expected 
to be received under it. The unavoidable 
costs under a contract reﬂect the least 
net cost of exiting from the contract, 
which is the lower of the cost of fulﬁlling 
it and any compensation or penalties 
arising from failure to fulﬁl it. The cost 
of fulﬁlling a contract comprises the 
costs that relate directly to the contract 
(i.e., both incremental costs and an 
allocation of costs directly related to 
contract activities).
  • Contingent Liabilities
    A contingent liability is a possible 
obligation that arises from past events 
whose existence will be conﬁrmed by 
the occurrence or non-occurrence of 
one or more uncertain future events 
beyond the control of Group or a 
present obligation that is not recognised 
because it is not probable that an 
outﬂow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation. A contingent 
liability also arises in extremely rare 
cases where there is a liability that

cannot be recognised because it cannot 
be measured reliably. The contingent 
liability is not recognised in the books of 
accounts but its existence is disclosed in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements 
by way of notes to accounts, unless 
possibility of an outﬂow of resources 
embodying economic beneﬁt is remote.
  2.3.17 Retirement and other employee 
beneﬁts
    Retirement beneﬁt in the form of 
provident fund is a deﬁned contribution 
scheme. The Group has no obligation, 
other than the contribution payable 
to the provident fund. The Group 
recognises contribution payable to the 
provident fund scheme as an expense, 
when an employee renders the related 
service. If the contribution payable to 
the scheme for service received before 
the balance sheet date exceeds the 
contribution already paid, the deﬁcit 
payable to the scheme is recognised as a 
liability after deducting the contribution 
already paid. If the contribution already 
paid exceeds the contribution due for 
services received before the balance 
sheet date, then excess is recognised 
as an asset to the extent that the pre-
payment will lead to, for example, 
a reduction in future payment or a  
cash refund.
    The Group operates a deﬁned beneﬁt 
gratuity plan in India, which requires 
contributions to be made to a separately 
administered fund.
    The cost of providing beneﬁts under 
the deﬁned beneﬁt plan is determined 
using the projected unit credit method.
    Remeasurements, comprising of 
actuarial gains and losses, the 
eﬀect of the asset ceiling, excluding 
amounts included in net interest on 
the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability and 
the return on plan assets (excluding 
amounts included in net interest on 
the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability), are 
recognised immediately in the balance 
sheet with a corresponding debit or 
credit to retained earnings through 
OCI in the period in which they occur. 
Remeasurements are not reclassiﬁed to 
proﬁt or loss in subsequent periods.
    Past service costs are recognised in 
proﬁt or loss on the earlier of:
   •  The date of the plan amendment or 
curtailment, and
   •  The date that the Group recognises 
related restructuring costs
    Net interest is calculated by applying 
the discount rate to the net deﬁned 
beneﬁt liability or asset. The Group 
recognises the following changes in 
the net deﬁned beneﬁt obligation as an 
expense in the consolidated statement 
of proﬁt and loss:
    Service costs comprising current 
service costs, past-service costs, gains 
and losses on curtailments and non-
routine settlements; and Net interest 
expense or income
    Accumulated leave, which is expected 
to be utilised within the next 12 months, 
is treated as short-term employee 
beneﬁt. The group measures the 
expected cost of such absences as the 
additional amount that it expects to pay 
as a result of the unused entitlement 
that has accumulated at the reporting 
date. The group recognises expected 
cost of short-term employee beneﬁt as 
an expense, when an employee renders 
the related service.
    The Group treats accumulated leave 
expected to be carried forward beyond 
twelve months, as long-term employee 
beneﬁt for measurement purposes. 
Such long-term compensated absences 
are provided for based on the actuarial 
valuation using the projected unit credit 
method at the reporting date. Actuarial 
gains/losses are immediately taken to 
the statement of proﬁt and loss and 
are not deferred. The obligations are 
presented as current liabilities in the 
balance sheet if the entity does not 
have an unconditional right to defer the 
settlement for at least twelve months 
after the reporting date.

Trust Overview
  2.3.18  Financial instruments
    A ﬁnancial instrument is any contract 
that gives rise to a ﬁnancial asset of one 
entity and a ﬁnancial liability or equity 
instrument of another entity.
   Financial assets
   Initial recognition and measurement
    Financial assets are classiﬁed, at initial 
recognition, as subsequently measured 
at amortised cost, fair value through 
other comprehensive income (OCI), 
and fair value through proﬁt or loss.
    The classiﬁcation of ﬁnancial assets 
at initial recognition depends on the 
ﬁnancial asset’s contractual cash ﬂow 
characteristics and the Group’s business 
model for managing them. With the 
exception of trade receivables that 
do not contain a signiﬁcant ﬁnancing 
component or for which the Group 
has applied the practical expedient, 
the Group initially measures a ﬁnancial 
asset at its fair value plus, in the case 
of a ﬁnancial asset not at fair value 
through proﬁt or loss, transaction costs. 
Trade receivables that do not contain 
a signiﬁcant ﬁnancing component or 
for which the Group has applied the 
practical expedient are measured at the 
transaction price determined under Ind 
AS 115. Refer to the accounting policies 
in section (f) Revenue from contracts 
with customers.
    In order for a ﬁnancial asset to be 
classiﬁed and measured at amortised 
cost or fair value through OCI, it 
needs to give rise to cash ﬂows that 
are ‘solely payments of principal and 
interest (SPPI)’ on the principal amount 
outstanding. This assessment is referred 
to as the SPPI test and is performed at 
an instrument level. Financial assets 
with cash ﬂows that are not SPPI are 
classiﬁed and measured at fair value 
through proﬁt or loss, irrespective of 
the business model.
    The Group’s business model for 
managing ﬁnancial assets refers to how 
it manages its ﬁnancial assets in order 
to generate cash ﬂows. The business 
model determines whether cash ﬂows 
will result from collecting contractual 
cash ﬂows, selling the ﬁnancial assets, 
or both. Financial assets classiﬁed 
and measured at amortised cost are 
held within a business model with the 
objective to hold ﬁnancial assets in 
order to collect contractual cash ﬂows 
while ﬁnancial assets classiﬁed and 
measured at fair value through OCI are 
held within a business model with the 
objective of both holding to collect 
contractual cash ﬂows and selling.
    Purchases or sales of ﬁnancial assets 
that require delivery of assets within a 
time frame established by regulation or 
convention in the marketplace (regular 
way trades) are recognised on the 
trade date, i.e., the date that the Group 
commits to purchase or sell the asset.
   Subsequent measurement
    For purposes of subsequent 
measurement, ﬁnancial assets are 
classiﬁed in four categories:
   •  Financial assets at amortised cost 
(debt instruments)
   •  Financial assets at fair value 
through other comprehensive 
income (FVTOCI) with recycling of 
cumulative gains and losses (debt 
instruments)
   •  Financial assets designated at 
fair value through OCI with no 
recycling of cumulative gains and 
losses upon derecognition (equity 
instruments)
   •  Financial assets at fair value 
through proﬁt or loss (FVTPL)
    Financial assets at amortised cost (debt 
instruments)
    A ‘ﬁnancial asset’ is measured at the 
amortised cost if both the following 
conditions are met:
   •  The asset is held within a business 
model whose objective is to hold 
assets for collecting contractual 
cash ﬂows, and
Knowledge Realty Trust
RN: IN/REIT/24-25/0006
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements (Contd.)
212 Half Yearly Report FY 2025-26
   •   Contractual terms of the asset give 
rise on speciﬁed dates to cash 
ﬂows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest (SPPI) on the 
principal amount outstanding.
      After initial measurement, such 
ﬁnancial assets are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost 
using the eﬀective interest rate 
(EIR) method. Amortised cost is 
calculated by taking into account 
any discount or premium on 
acquisition and fees or costs that 
are an integral part of the EIR. The 
EIR amortisation is included in 
ﬁnance income in the proﬁt or loss. 
The losses arising from impairment 
are recognised in the proﬁt or loss.
    Financial assets at fair value through 
OCI (FVTOCI) (debt instruments)
    A ‘ﬁnancial asset’ is classiﬁed as at the 
FVTOCI if both of the following criteria 
are met:
   i.  The objective of the business model 
is achieved both by collecting 
contractual cash ﬂows and selling 
the ﬁnancial assets, and
   ii.  The asset’s contractual cash ﬂows 
represent SPPI
    Debt instruments included within the 
FVTOCI category are measured initially 
as well as at each reporting date at fair 
value. For debt instruments, at fair value 
through OCI, interest income, foreign 
exchange revaluation and impairment 
losses or reversals are recognised in the 
proﬁt or loss and computed in the same 
manner as for ﬁnancial assets measured 
at amortised cost. The remaining fair 
value changes are recognised in OCI. 
Upon derecognition, the cumulative 
fair value changes recognised in OCI 
is reclassiﬁed from the equity to proﬁt  
or loss
    Financial assets designated at fair 
value through OCI (equity instruments)
    Upon initial recognition, the Group can 
elect to classify irrevocably its equity 
investments as equity instruments 
designated at fair value through OCI 
when they meet the deﬁnition of equity 
under Ind AS 32 Financial Instruments: 
Presentation and are not held for 
trading. The classiﬁcation is determined 
on an instrument-by-instrument basis. 
Equity instruments which are held for 
trading and contingent consideration 
recognised by an acquirer in a business 
combination to which Ind AS103 applies 
are classiﬁed as at FVTPL.
    Gains and losses on these ﬁnancial 
assets are never recycled to proﬁt or 
loss. Dividends are recognised as other 
income in the statement of proﬁt and 
loss when the right of payment has 
been established, except when the 
Group beneﬁts from such proceeds as 
a recovery of part of the cost of the 
ﬁnancial asset, in which case, such gains 
are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments 
designated at fair value through OCI are 
not subject to impairment assessment.
    Financial assets at fair value through 
proﬁt or loss
    Financial assets at fair value through 
proﬁt or loss are carried in the balance 
sheet at fair value with net changes in 
fair value recognised in the statement 
of proﬁt and loss.
    This category includes derivative 
instruments and listed equity 
investments which the Group had not 
irrevocably elected to classify at fair 
value through OCI. Dividends on listed 
equity investments are recognised in the 
statement of proﬁt and loss when the 
right of payment has been established.
   Derecognition
    A ﬁnancial asset (or, where applicable, 
a part of a ﬁnancial asset or part of a 
group of similar ﬁnancial assets) is 
primarily derecognised (i.e. removed 
from the Group’s consolidated balance 
sheet) when:
   •  The rights to receive cash ﬂows 
from the asset have expired, or
   •  The Group has transferred its 
rights to receive cash ﬂows from 
the asset or has assumed an

Trust Overview
obligation to pay the received 
cash ﬂows in full without material 
delay to a third party under a 
‘pass-through’ arrangement; and 
either (a) the group has transferred 
substantially all the risks and 
rewards of the asset, or (b) the 
group has neither transferred nor 
retained substantially all the risks 
and rewards of the asset, but has 
transferred control of the asset.
     When the Group has transferred its 
rights to receive cash ﬂows from 
an asset or has entered into a pass-
through arrangement, it evaluates if 
and to what extent it has retained 
the risks and rewards of ownership. 
When it has neither transferred 
nor retained substantially all of the 
risks and rewards of the asset, nor 
transferred control of the asset, the 
Group continues to recognise the 
transferred asset to the extent of the 
Group’s continuing involvement. In 
that case, the Group also recognises 
an associated liability. The 
transferred asset and the associated 
liability are measured on a basis that 
reﬂects the rights and obligations 
that the Group has retained.
     Continuing involvement that takes 
the form of a guarantee over the 
transferred asset is measured at 
the lower of the original carrying 
amount of the asset and the 
maximum amount of consideration 
that the group could be required  
to repay.
   Impairment of ﬁnancial assets
    The Group recognises an allowance for 
expected credit losses (ECLs) for all 
debt instruments not held at fair value 
through proﬁt or loss. ECLs are based on 
the diﬀerence between the contractual 
cash ﬂows due in accordance with the 
contract and all the cash ﬂows that the 
Group expects to receive, discounted 
at an approximation of the original 
eﬀective interest rate. The expected 
cash ﬂows will include cash ﬂows from 
the sale of collateral held or other credit 
enhancements that are integral to the 
contractual terms.
    ECLs are recognised in two stages. 
For credit exposures for which there 
has not been a signiﬁcant increase 
in credit risk since initial recognition, 
ECLs are provided for credit losses 
that result from default events that 
are possible within the next 12-months 
(a 12-month ECL). For those credit 
exposures for which there has been a 
signiﬁcant increase in credit risk since 
initial recognition, a loss allowance is 
required for credit losses expected 
over the remaining life of the exposure, 
irrespective of the timing of the default 
(a lifetime ECL).
    For trade receivables and contract 
assets, the Group applies a simpliﬁed 
approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, 
the Group does not track changes in 
credit risk, but instead recognises a 
loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs 
at each reporting date. The Group 
has established a provision matrix 
that is based on its historical credit 
loss experience, adjusted for forward-
looking factors speciﬁc to the debtors 
and the economic environment.
    For debt instruments at fair value 
through OCI, the Group applies the 
low credit risk simpliﬁcation. At every 
reporting date, the Group evaluates 
whether the debt instrument is 
considered to have low credit risk 
using all reasonable and supportable 
information that is available without 
undue cost or eﬀort.
    It is the Group’s policy to measure ECLs 
on such instruments on a 12-month 
basis. However, when there has been a 
signiﬁcant increase in credit risk since 
origination, the allowance will be based 
on the lifetime ECL.
   Financial liabilities

recognition, as ﬁnancial liabilities at fair

value through proﬁt or loss, loans and 
borrowings, payables, or as derivatives 
designated as hedging instruments in 
an eﬀective hedge, as appropriate.
    All ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised 
initially at fair value and, in the case of 
loans and borrowings and payables, 
net of directly attributable transaction 
costs.
   Subsequent measurement
    For purposes of subsequent 
measurement, ﬁnancial liabilities are 
classiﬁed in two categories:
   •   Financial liabilities at fair value 
through proﬁt or loss
   •   Financial liabilities at amortised 
cost (loans and borrowings)
    Financial liabilities at fair value through 
proﬁt or loss
     Financial liabilities at fair value through 
proﬁt or loss include ﬁnancial liabilities 
held for trading and ﬁnancial liabilities 
designated upon initial recognition as 
at fair value through proﬁt or loss.
      Financial liabilities are classiﬁed as 
held for trading if they are incurred 
for the purpose of repurchasing in the 
near term. This category also includes 
derivative ﬁnancial instruments 
entered into by the Group that are not 
designated as hedging instruments 
in hedge relationships as deﬁned by 
Ind AS 109. Separated embedded 
derivatives are also classiﬁed as held 
for trading unless they are designated 
as eﬀective hedging instruments.
     Gains or losses on liabilities held for 
trading are recognised in the proﬁt or 
loss.
     Financial liabilities designated upon 
initial recognition at fair value through 
proﬁt or loss are designated as such at 
the initial date of recognition, and only 
if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisﬁed. 
For liabilities designated as FVTPL, 
fair value gains/ losses attributable 
to changes in own credit risk are 
recognised in OCI. These gains/ losses 
are not subsequently transferred to 
P&L. However, the group may transfer 
the cumulative gain or loss within 
equity. All other changes in fair value 
of such liability are recognised in the 
statement of proﬁt and loss. The Group 
has not designated any ﬁnancial liability 
as at fair value through proﬁt or loss.
    Financial liabilities at amortised cost 
(Loans and borrowings)
     After initial recognition, interest-bearing 
loans and borrowings are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using 
the EIR method. Gains and losses are 
recognised in proﬁt or loss when the 
liabilities are derecognised as well as 
through the EIR amortisation process. 
    Amortised cost is calculated by taking 
into account any discount or premium 
on acquisition and fees or costs that 
are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR 
amortisation is included as ﬁnance 
costs in the statement of proﬁt and loss.
    Financial guarantee contracts
    Financial guarantee contracts issued 
by the group are those contracts 
that require a payment to be made 
to reimburse the holder for a loss it 
incurs because the speciﬁed debtor 
fails to make a payment when due 
in accordance with the terms of a 
debt instrument. Financial guarantee 
contracts are recognised initially as 
a liability at fair value, adjusted for 
transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to the issuance of the 
guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is 
measured at the higher of the amount 
of loss allowance determined as per 
impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 
and the amount recognised less, when 
appropriate, the cumulative amount of 
income recognised in accordance with 
the principles of Ind AS 115.
   Derecognition
    A ﬁnancial liability is derecognised 
when the obligation under the liability 
is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing ﬁnancial liability is 
Knowledge Realty Trust

Trust Overview
replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially diﬀerent terms, 
or the terms of an existing liability 
are substantially modiﬁed, such an 
exchange or modiﬁcation is treated 
as the derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new 
liability. The diﬀerence in the respective 
carrying amounts is recognised in the 
statement of proﬁt and loss.
   Reclassiﬁcation of ﬁnancial assets
    The Group determines classiﬁcation of 
ﬁnancial assets and liabilities on initial 
recognition. After initial recognition, 
no reclassiﬁcation is made for ﬁnancial 
assets which are equity instruments 
and ﬁnancial liabilities. For ﬁnancial 
assets which are debt instruments, a 
reclassiﬁcation is made only if there 
is a change in the business model 
for managing those assets. Changes 
to the business model are expected 
to be infrequent. The Group’s senior 
management determines change 
in the business model as a result of 
external or internal changes which are 
signiﬁcant to the Group’s operations. 
Such changes are evident to external 
parties. A change in the business model 
occurs when the Group either begins 
or ceases to perform an activity that is 
signiﬁcant to its operations. If the Group 
reclassiﬁes ﬁnancial assets, it applies the 
reclassiﬁcation prospectively from the 
reclassiﬁcation date which is the ﬁrst 
day of the immediately next reporting 
period following the change in business 
model. The Group does not restate any 
previously recognised gains, losses 
(including impairment gains or losses) 
or interest.

Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements (Contd.)
    The following table shows various reclassiﬁcation and how they are accounted for:
Original 
classiﬁcation
Revised classiﬁcation Accounting treatment
Amortised cost FVTPL Fair value is measured at reclassiﬁcation date. 
Diﬀerence between previous amortized cost and fair 
value is recognised in proﬁt or loss.
FVTPL Amortised Cost Fair value at reclassiﬁcation date becomes its new 
gross carrying amount. EIR is calculated based on the 
new gross carrying amount.
Amortised cost FVTOCI Fair value is measured at reclassiﬁcation date. 
Diﬀerence between previous amortised cost and fair 
value is recognised in OCI. No change in EIR due to 
reclassiﬁcation.
FVTOCI Amortised cost Fair value at reclassiﬁcation date becomes its new 
amortised cost carrying amount. However, cumulative 
gain or loss in OCI is adjusted against fair value. 
Consequently, the asset is measured as if it had always 
been measured at amortised cost.
FVTPL FVTOCI Fair value at reclassiﬁcation date becomes its new 
carrying amount. No other adjustment is required.
FVTOCI FVTPL Assets continue to be measured at fair value. Cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassiﬁed 
from equity to proﬁt or loss the reclassiﬁcation date.
   Oﬀsetting of ﬁnancial instruments
     Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities 
are oﬀset and the net amount is reported 
in the standalone balance sheet if there 
is a currently enforceable legal right to 
oﬀset the recognised amounts and there 
is an intention to settle on a net basis, to 
realise the assets and settle the liabilities 
simultaneously.
  2.3.19Unit Capital
    Units issued by the Trust are classiﬁed 
as equity. Incremental costs directly

RN: IN/REIT/24-25/0006
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements (Contd.)
attributable to the issuance of units are 
recognised as a deduction from equity, 
net of any tax eﬀects.
  2.3.20 Cash and cash equivalents
    Cash and cash equivalent in the balance 
sheet comprise cash at banks and on 
hand, cheques on hand and short-term 
deposits with an original maturity of 
three months or less, that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash 
and subject to an insigniﬁcant risk of 
changes in value.
  2.3.21 Distribution Policy
    The Net Distributable Cash Flows 
of Trust are based on the cash 
ﬂows generated from Trust’s assets 
and investments. In terms of the 
Distribution Policy of the Trust and the 
REIT Regulations, not less than 90% of 
the NDCF of each of the Asset SPVs is 
required to be distributed to the Trust, 
in proportion of Trust’s shareholding 
in the Asset SPV, subject to applicable 
provisions of the Companies Act 2013. 
Presently, NDCF to be received by the 
Trust from the Asset SPVs may be in 
the form of dividends, interest income, 
principal loan repayment, proceeds 
of any capital reduction or buyback 
from the Asset SPVs or as speciﬁcally 
permitted under the Trust Deed or in 
such other form as may be permissible 
under the REIT Regulations. Such SPV 
Distributions shall be declared and 
made for every quarter of a Financial 
Year in terms of the Distribution Policy.
  2.3.22  Statement of net assets at fair value
    The disclosure of statement of Net 
Assets at Fair value is determined basis 
the fair values of the properties held by 
SPVs/Investment Entity and the Holding 
Company as well as book values of the 
total liabilities and other assets of the 
Group. The fair value of the property 
held by SPVs/Investment Entity and 
Holding Company are reviewed semi-
annually taking into consideration 
market conditions existing at the 
reporting date, and other generally 
accepted market practises.
  2.3.23 Cash distribution to Unitholders
    The Group recognises a liability to make 
cash distributions to Unitholders when 
the distribution is authorised. As per 
the REIT Regulations, a distribution is 
authorised when it is approved by the 
Board of Directors of the Manager. A 
corresponding amount is recognised 
directly in equity.
  2.3.24  Statement of Cash ﬂows
    Cash ﬂows are reported using the indirect 
method, whereby net proﬁt before tax is 
adjusted for the eﬀects of transactions 
of a non-cash nature and any deferrals or 
accruals of past or future cash receipts or 
payments. The cash ﬂows from operating, 
investing and ﬁnancing activities of the 
Group are segregated.
    For the purpose of the Statement of 
Cash Flow, cash and cash equivalents 
consist of cash at banks and on hand, 
cheques on hand and short-term 
deposits, as deﬁned above, net of 
outstanding bank/book overdrafts as 
they are considered an integral part of 
the Group’s cash management.
  2.3.25 Earnings per unit
    Basic earnings per unit is calculated by 
dividing the net proﬁt or loss attributable 
to unit holders by the weighted average 
number of units outstanding during the 
period.
    For the purpose of calculating diluted 
earnings per unit, the net proﬁt or 
loss for the period attributable to 
unitholders and the weighted average 
number of units outstanding during the 
period are adjusted for the eﬀects of all 
dilutive potential units.
  2.3.25  Earnings before ﬁnance costs, 
depreciation, amortisation and tax 
(EBITDA)
       The Group has elected to present 
EBITDA as a separate line item on the 
face of the Condensed Consolidated 
Statement of Proﬁt and Loss. In its 
measurement, the Group does not 
include ﬁnance costs, depreciation, 
amortisation and tax.

 Note (i)
 (a)  In earlier years, OICPL had received an order under section 143(3) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (the 
“Act”), wherein the Assessing Oﬃcer has made certain additions relating to disallowance of interest 
on loans given and disallowance u/s 14A of the Act in assessment year 2020-21 and for determining 
taxable income based on percentage of completion method for residential properties sold by OICPL 
in assessment year 2013-14, resulting in tax liability of ` 96.67 million and ` 362.80 million respectively. 
OICPL has ﬁled an appeal before Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals) (‘CIT(A)’) against the said 
orders, which is pending disposition. Based on the facts of the case, the management believes that 
OICPL has merits in the said cases and accordingly no provision is recognised in the condensed 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements at this stage.

 (b)  OBRPL had received an order dated September 29, 2022 under section 143(3) of the the Act, wherein 
the Assessing Oﬃcer has made certain additions reducing the returned loss by the same extent 
resulting in tax liability of ` 347.93 million. Subsequently, OBRPL has ﬁled an appeal before CIT(A) 
against the said order. Based on the facts of the case, the management believes that OBRPL has merits 
in the said case and accordingly no provision is recognised in the condensed consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements at this stage.
 (c)  For Assessment Year 2022-23 and 2023-24, the Assessing Oﬃcer has granted short TDS amounting to 
` 133.40 million pursuant to demerger of the OWCPL from erstwhile company resulting in a tax liability/
short refund of equivalent amount. However, based on the facts of the case, the management believes 
that OWCPL shall be able to substantiate their claim and accordingly no provision is recognised in the 
condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements at this stage.
 Note (ii)
 (a)  OBRPL has an ongoing litigation involving a customer for breaches under the Leave and Licence 
Agreement (‘LLA’) to pay a sum of ` 178.96 million, against which OBRPL has ﬁled a counter claim of  
` 250.00 million for wrongful termination of the LLA. The management believes that no material liability 
will devolve on OBRPL in respect of the said litigation and accordingly no provision is recognised in the 
condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements at this stage.
 (b)  During the year ended March 31, 2025, the commercial building of SHPL was inspected by Bruhat 
Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (‘BBMP’) for the issuance of Occupancy Certiﬁcate (‘OC’) and observed 
that there is deviation in construction with modiﬁed sanction plan which is within Regularised limit as 
per Building Bye Laws 2003. The Commissioner of BBMP issued a demand note dated July 08, 2024 
directing SHPL to deposit ground rent of ` 146.01 million, scrutiny fee of ` 5.20 million and deviation 
fee of ` 18.70 million as a precondition to issue OC, which has been appealed by SHPL before by 
Karnataka High Court (‘HC’). Consequent to the appeal, the HC, through an interim order dated August 
7, 2024, has granted stay on 50% of the scrutiny fee and 100% of the ground rent demanded by 
BBMP. Accordingly, the balance amount demanded has been disclosed as contingent liability in these 
condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
 (c)  SHPL had received an order in November, 2022, passed by the District Registrar, Ganganagar Sub-
Registrar Oﬃce (“DR Order”) directing SHPL to pay a sum of ` 44.98 million towards deﬁcit in stamp 
duty and registration fees with regards to a registration of joint development agreement pertaining to 
the undeveloped residential converted property bearing BBMP Khata No. 1303/6/1 & 7/1, measuring 
about 6 Acres 37 guntas, situated at Venkatala Village, Yelahanka Hobli, Bengaluru North Taluk. 
Subsequently, SHPL has ﬁled an appeal before the Karnataka Appellate Tribunal (“KAT”) against the 
DR Order and prayed, inter alia, to set aside the DR Order. The management believes that SHPL, based 
on its grounds of appeal has an arguable case in the matter on merits and expects no material liability 
towards same. Accordingly, the said amount demanded has been disclosed as contingent liability in 
these condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
 (d)  CGDPL is subject to legal proceedings and claims, which have arisen in the ordinary course of business, 
including certain litigation for lands acquired by it for construction purposes, either through joint 
development agreements or through outright purchases. These cases are pending with various courts 
and are scheduled for hearings. The management of CGDPL believes that these cases will not adversely 
eﬀect its ﬁnancial position. Further, CGDPL does not expect any outﬂow in respect of the above 
contingent liability and it is not practicable to estimate the amount and timings of the cash outﬂows, if 
any, in respect of the said matters, pending resolution of the arbitration/appellate proceedings.

C Other matters
 (i) OQRPL:
   During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Gurugram District Court issued an order dated January 
24, 2024, directing the attachment and sale of a land and building property (the “Property”) owned 
by OQRPL, in connection with an unrelated third-party litigation. The Court appointed the Civil Nazir 
(Court Auctioneer) to carry out the sale of the Property.
   OQRPL promptly ﬁled an appeal before the Division Bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court on January 
29, 2024. Pursuant to the order dated January 30, 2024, the High Court granted a stay on the proposed 
sale and permitted OQRPL to lease the Property for a period of 30 years.
   Subsequently, the matter was referred to the Single Judge Bench of the Delhi High Court and has 
since been remanded back to the District Court, Gurugram by order dated August 20, 2025, where 
proceedings are currently ongoing.
   Based on the facts of the case i.e. Property attachment in an unrelated litigation and advice of in-house 
legal team, the management believes that OQRPL has merits in the said case and no adjustment to 
these condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements is required in this matter.”
13 ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARIES
A Acquisition of Asset SPVs
 I Asset acquisition
   During the period ended September 30, 2025, Knowledge Realty Trust entered into Share Purchase 
Agreements with shareholders of Asset SPVs for acquisition of equity interest as described in more detail 
in Note 1 - Organisation structure; in exchange for units of Knowledge Realty Trust. The management 
has applied the optional concentration test, under Ind AS 103, and concluded that the acquired set 
of activities and assets is not a business because substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets 
acquired is concentrated in investment properties and related assets, with similar risk characteristics. 
Accordingly, the acquisition has been accounted for as an asset acquisition.
   The management has identiﬁed and recognised the individual identiﬁable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed; and allocated the purchase consideration to the individual identiﬁable assets and liabilities 
on the basis of their relative fair values at the date of acquisition.
   The allocated value of the identiﬁable assets and liabilities of the Asset SPVs as at the date of acquisition 
were:

 II Measurement of fair values
   The valuation techniques (Level 3) used for measuring the fair value of material assets acquired are as 
follows:
Particulars Valuation Methodology
Property, plant 
and equipment 
and Investment 
property
Fair values have been determined by independent external property valuers, having 
appropriately recognised professional qualiﬁcation and recent experience in the 
location and category of the properties being valued. The valuers have followed 
“Direct comparison approach” for Land, “Depreciated replacement cost approach” 
for the built up component. Direct comparison approach involves comparing to 
similar properties that have actually been sold in an arms length transaction or 
are oﬀered for sale. Depreciated replacement cost approach considers the current 
cost of replacing an asset with its equivalent asset less deductions for physical 
deterioration and all relevant forms of obsolescence and optimisation.
Other assets 
other than those 
mentioned above
Book values as on the date of acquisition have been considered as fair values.
Liabilities Liabilities includes loans and borrowings, trade payables, provision for employee 
beneﬁts and other liabilities. Book values as on the date of acquisition have been 
considered as fair values.
B Acquisition of Investment Entities

Agreements with shareholders of Investment Entities for acquisition of equity interest as described in

Site Conditions:  We do not commission site investigations to determine the suitability of ground c onditions and services, nor 
do we undertake environmental or geotechnical surveys. We have assumed that these aspects are satisfactory 
and also that the site is clear of underground mineral or other workings, me thane gas or other noxious 
substances.  
In the case of asset which may have redevelopment potential, we pr oceed on the basis that the site has load 
bearing capacity suitable for the anticipated form of redevelopment without the  need for additional and 
expensive foundations or drainage systems (unless stated otherwise)  
Hazardous & 
deleterious 
materials 
Unless otherwise noted, we have assumed that the improvements are free o f Asbestos and Hazardous 
Materials, or should these materials be present then they do not pose sign ificant risk to human health, nor 
require immediate removal. We assume the site is free of subsoil asbestos and have made no allowance in our 
valuation for site remediation works.  
Our visual inspection is an inconclusive indicator of the actual condition /presence of asbestos/hazardous 
materials within the asset.  We make no representation as to the actual status of the Asset.  If a test is 
undertaken at some time in the future to assess the degree, if any, of the presence of any asbestos/hazardous 
materials on site and this is found to be positive, this valuation must not be relied upon before first consulting 
iVAS Partners to r eassess any effect on the valuation.  Unless specifically i nstructed, we do not carry out 
investigations to ascertain whether any building has been constructed or alter ed using deleterious materials 
or methods. Unless specifically notified, our valuation assumes that no such materials or met hods have been 
used 
Heightened Market 
Volatility 
 geopolitical tensions across various regions present significant uncertainty, 
with the potential for rapid escalation. Further, recent increases and pro posed changes to international trade 
tariffs among major economies, and geopolitical risk relating to energy prices have added further volatility and 
uncertainty. Collectively, these factors contribute to elevated risks to global trade and economic stability. The 
potential impact on the Indian economy and property market r emains uncertain, with the possibility of 
heightened market volatility in some property markets over the short -to-medium term.  
Experience has shown that consumer and investor behaviour can quickly chan ge during periods of such 
heightened volatility. Lending or investment decisions should account for this heightened level of volatility and 
potential for deteriorating market conditions both domestically and globally. Caution is advised in this regard. 
Conclusions set out in this report are valid as at the valuation/report date only . Where appropriate, we 
recommend that the valuation/market is closely monitored, as we con tinue to track how markets respond to 
evolving events. 
Development 
Valuation 
The value of real estate developments is traditionally volatile and ca n be subject to rapid changes of value in 
short timeframes.  Development projects appeal to specific types of purchasers and can be signifi cantly 
impacted by many factors such as broader economic conditions, fluctuat ing levels of supply and demand for 
the product, changes in building costs and the availability and c ost of development finance.  All these (and 
more) factors could have a significant impact on the value and demand for the Subject Assets. 
Going forward there will be several key factors impacting the viability of some development projects and their 
underlying land values. Key concerns are fluctuations in construction costs, substantial new supply levels and 
easing investor demand for final product. In addition, we also note that ongoing monitoring and governance of 
banking systems may significantly restrict development capital and increase the cost of development finance.  
As experienced in previous market cycles, the value of real estate developm ents can undergo rapid and 
significant price corrections, as supply, demand and cost factors change. Any Reliant Party is strongly advised 
to consider this inherent risk in their investment and lending decisions.  Lending and investment caution is 
advised in this regard.

2. Valuation Approach & Methodology 
2.1 Scope of Valuation 
The valuation exercise is to assess the Market Value of the Subject Asset(s) of Knowledge Realty Trust for financial 
and investor reporting purposes to comply with the requirements of Regulation 21 of the SEBI (REIT) 
Regulations, 2014, as amended. The valuations have been conducted in accordance with the International Valuation 
Standards by the International Valuation Standards Council 
 IVSC
 , (effective 31 January 2025, as applicable on the 
date of valuation), and in accordance with the requirements of the SEBI REIT Regulations, 2014, as amended from time 
to time. 
The Valuer has assessed the Market Value of each Individual Subject Asset (s), not the value of the portfolio, if all 
Assets were sold in one transaction. Where a summation of the individual Assets is provided, this is purely for reference 
only and should not be construed as the value of the portfolio.  
2.2 Basis of Valuation 
The valuations have been conducted in accordance with the International Valuation Standards by IVSC (effective from 
31 January 2025, as applicable on the date of valuation) and is in compliance with the International Valuation Standards 
(IVS) and is in accordance with the SEBI REIT Regulation s, 2014 . The valuation exercise has been undertaken by 
appropriately qualified Valuer and is aimed at assessing the Market Value of the Subject Assets.  
According to IVS 102, the Market Value is defined as:  
knowledgeably, prudently an
  
2.3 Approach and Methodology 
The purpose of this valuation exercise is to estimate the M arket Value of the Subject Assets. Market Value for the 
purpose of valuation outlined has been carried basis Income Approach. The same is detailed below 
   
Income Approach 
The income approach is based on the premise that value of an income - producing asset is a function of future benefits 
and income derived from that asset. There are two commonly used methods of the income approach in real estate 
valuation namely, Direct Capitalization and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF).  
2.4 Approach and Methodology Adopted 
A large number of leases at the Subject Assets were executed at rentals prevalent at the time of signing of such leases 
or at a discount to prevailing market rental (for a few anchor tenants). Since the real estate industry is dynamic and is 
influenced by various factors (such as existing supply, tena nts looking at spaces, quality of spaces available in the 
market, overall health of the economy, existing rentals, future growth plans, etc.) at a particular point in time, negotiated 
rentals may tend to move away from the prevalent market rents over a period of time. It has also been witnessed that 
the market rents for some assets or sub-markets increase or decrease at a rate significantly different from those 
agreed to in initial leases. These factors reinforce the need to review each of these leases in isolation to assess the 
intrinsic value of the asset under review. 
Considering the objective of this exercise and the nature of asset involved, the value of the office component in the 
Subject Assets has been assessed through the Discounted Cash Flow Method using Rental Reversion and the value

SUMMARY VALUATION REPORT | Page 14 
of the solar plants have been derived using Discounted Cash Flow Method. Further, the following steps have been 
adopted as part of 
 s valuation for the respective Subject Asset. 
Asset-specific Review: 
• As the first step to the valuation of the asset, the rent rolls as of 30th September 2025 (and the corresponding 
lease deeds on a sample basis) were reviewed to identify tenancy characteristics for the asset.  
• Title documents were reviewed for validation of area details, ownership of the asset. 
Sub-market Review: 
A detailed assessment of the site and surroundings has been undertaken with respect to the prevalent activities, 
change in dynamics impacting the values and the optimal use of the respective assets vis-à-vis their surrounding sub-
market, etc. Further, a secondary research exercise has been carried out in the catchment areas for the respective 
assets to ascertain the transaction activity of commercial developments. This has been achieved through interactions 
with various market players such as developers, re al estate brokers, key office tenants, etc. Peers to the assets were 
identified in terms of potential competition (both for completed and under -construction/future developments ), 
comparable recent lease transactions witnessed in the sub-market were analysed along with the leasing and re-leasing 
history within the asset over the last 3 
  4 years. This was undertaken to assess the applicable market rent ( Valuer
view on rental for the asset 
  used for leasing vacant spaces as well as upon releasing).  
Cash Flow Projections: 
A. Commercial Office 
The cash flows for the operational and under -construction/future development area (if applicable) were projected 
separately to arrive at their respective value conclusion. 
The Valuer has utilized the EBITDA to arrive at the value of the Subject Assets. The following steps were undertaken 
to arrive at the value for operational and under-construction/future development area respectively. 
• The Valuer has projected future cash flows from the  asset based on existing lease terms for the operational 
area till lock-in expiry of the leases or re -negotiation (using the variance analysis), whichever is earlier. Post 
which, the lease terms have been aligned with market rentals. For vacant area and under-construction/future 
development area, the Valuer has projected the market rent led cash flows factoring appropriate lease-up time 
frame. Further, these cash flows have been projected for 10 -year duration from the date of valuation and for 
11th year (for assessment of terminal value). These future financial benefits are then discounted to a present-
day value (valuation date) at an appropriate discount rate. 
• For each lease, the following steps have been undertaken to assess the rental and CAM revenue over a 10-
year time horizon: 
Step 1: Project the rentals and CAM revenue for identified tenancies up to the period of lease expiry, lock -in expiry, 
first escalation, second escalation, etc. whichever is applicable. In the event of unleased spaces, market-led rentals to 
be adopted with suitable lease-up time. 
Valuation Report
Knowledge Realty Trust 253
KNOWLEDGE REALTY OFFICE MANAGEMENT SERVICES PRIVATE LIMITED | KNOWLEDGE REALTY TRUST  
  
SUMMARY VALUATION REPORT | Page 15 
Step 2: Generating a market rental and CAM revenue stream for identified tenancies for the time period similar to the 
cash flows drawn in the aforementioned step. 
Step 3: In the event the escalated contracted rental is above the market rent (viz. by 20%) post the lock in period, then 
contracted terms are discarded, and the terms are reverted to market. In the event the escalated contracted rent is 
below the market rent, the contracted terms are adopted going forward until the next term expiry. Intent of this step 
is to project the rental for respective leases until lease expiry as well as post expiry. 
Step 4: Computing the monthly income based on rentals projected as part of Step 3 and translating the same to a 
quarterly income (for the next 10 years and 11th year 
  considered for calculation of terminal value) 
Adjustments for other revenues and recurring operational expenses, CAM expenses, fit-out income (if any 
  the same 
has been considered below the 
 NOI
  and does not get capitalized) and vacancy provision as 
percentage of total income, which includes lease rentals, parking rentals, CAM revenue and other income from signages 
and telecom towers (hereinafter referred 
 have been adopted in-line with prevalent market dynamics. 
In addition, appropriate rent-free periods have been adopted during lease roll-overs to factor potential rent-free terms 
as well as outflows towards brokerage. For all assets, we have looked at the operational revenues and expenses to 
understand the recurring, non -recurring, recoverable and non -recoverable expenses and accordingly modelled the 
revenue and expenses for the asset.  
The net income on quarterly basis has been projected over the next 10 years and the 1 year forward NOI (for 11th year) 
as of end of year 10 has been capitalized to assess the terminal value of the development. The quarterly net income 
over the next 10 years along with the terminal value during the end of year 10 have been discounted at a suitable 
discount rate to arrive at the Net Present Value 
 of the asset through this approach. 
B. Solar Plants 
For the solar component, future cash flows from the assets have been  projected based on the expected energy 
generation during the operational period, as outlined in the Power Purchase A greement (
 PPA
 ) between the solar 
provider and the office entity, either executed or to be executed. Monthly income was calculated using the agreed -
upon tariff (as per the PPA Agreement). Adjustments for operating expenses, maintenance/replacement costs, panel 
degradation, insurance, and other factors were made to determine the net income over the PPA term. This net income 
was subsequently discounted at an appropriate discount 
 NPV. 
2.5 Information Sources for Valuation
