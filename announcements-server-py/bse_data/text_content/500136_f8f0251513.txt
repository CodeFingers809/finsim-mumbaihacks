Commenting on the performance, Mr. Arvind Singhania, Chairman, Ester Industries said:  
“During Q2 FY26, Ester reported consolidated revenue of ₹357 crore, a 7% year-on-year growth, 
supported by higher volumes across both Polyester Film and Specialty Polymer segments. 
Profitability was affected adversely due to softer margins in Polyester Films. On consolidated 
basis, the Company earned an EBITDA of ₹17 crore (down 59% YoY) and incurred net loss of 
₹16 crore, reflecting the ongoing concerns in the Film segment due to pressure on margins in 
domestic market caused by imports and in overseas markets due to effect of US Trade Tariff. 
 
Consolidated EBITDA for the quarter would have been ₹28 crores (7.70%) but for adverse impact 
of exchange fluctuation and MTM losses on FCL / derivatives.  
 
The Specialty Polymer segment continued its strong performance with revenue of ₹57 crore, up 
39% YoY, and EBIT of ₹21 crore, up 45% YoY, supported by sustained demand for its marquee

products despite US Trade Tariff. Both volume of sales & margins remained protected due to IP 
protection. 
 
The Polyester Chips & Film segment, now including rPET, reported a rise in volume of sales in 
rPET by 219% and in Film by 9%. Ester Filmtech Limited (EFTL), wholly owned subsidiary, 
achieved 40% YoY growth in sales volume and 20% growth in revenue. Though the segment 
recorded a marginal revenue growth of 2%, the Film SBU witnessed shrinkage in margins due to 
imports and US Trade Tariff. Basis petition by domestic Polyester Film industry, DGTR has initiated 
investigation for imposition of Anti -Dumping Duty (ADD) against imports originating from 
Bangladesh, China PR, Thailand and USA.  
 
As regard to recycling project being pursued by ELITe, I am glad to inform you that all activities 
related to completion of the project by December 2027 are being pursued diligently. ELITe has 
entered into an agreement with a group of Sellers for acquisition of ~90 acres of project land in 
the PCPIR zone—strategically located in Surat, Gujrat providing access to polyester textile waste, 
skilled workforce, and a deep-water seaport.  
 
I am delighted to inform that multiple international marquee clients have started entering into 
offtake agreements much before commissioning of the plant, which reinforces the fact there is 
high demand for products to be offered by ELITe.  
 
A multi-year offtake agreement has been secured with Nike, making it the anchor customer for 
the Infinite Loop™ India facility. Under this agreement, ELITe will supply to Nike Twist™, Loop’s 
branded virgin -quality polyester resin made exclusively from textile waste, featuring full 
traceability through Loop’s proprietary chemical tracer technology. 
 
ELITe will supply recycled polyester intermediates and resins to Taro Plast S.p.A. under a new 
offtake agreement with Loop industries, including 100% recycled Loop™ DMT for automotive and 
specialty polymer applications. 
  
A strategic alliance has been formed with Hyosung TNC to convert high -purity, fully traceable 
Twist™ polyester into premium Regen™ performance yarns for leading apparel brands.  
 
With growing demand for Polyester Film, IP protection for certain marquee products in Specialty 
Polymers segment, and focus on products promoting recycling and sustainability, we are confident 
to continue creating value for our shareholders. Ester remains focused on strengthening its 
Specialty Polymer portfolio, improving operational efficiency, and advancing its circular economy 
vision through the ELITe project, positioning the Company for sustainable growth in the years 
ahead.”
