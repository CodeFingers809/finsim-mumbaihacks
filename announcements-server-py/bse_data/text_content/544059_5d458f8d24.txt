H1FY26 Overview
4
“H1 FY26 marked a pivotal step-up for Shanti Spintex, with our Highest-ever revenue of Rs 382 
crore and near-90% utilisation demonstrating both strong market traction and tighter 
operational discipline. The shift toward wide-width and value-added fabrics, supported by 
advanced blending capabilities and higher recycled yarn usage, continued to elevate our 
product profile and strengthen our positioning in the premium, sustainability-oriented segment.
Our sustainability framework is translating into measurable financial gains, with green energy 
assets meeting nearly 65% of power requirements and structurally lowering our cost base.
Improved working-capital discipline further enhanced liquidity, reducing the cash conversion 
cycle from 19 days in FY25 to 15 days in H1 FY26. Balance sheet resilience improved as well, 
with net debt-to-equity down to 0.11x.
Strategic integration remains a key margin lever, Forward integration through Teesta Spintex is 
already supporting better quality control, while the planned dyeing unit in FY27 will enable 
backward integration, strengthen the value chain, and drive incremental profitability.
As we continue to build on our capabilities, financial strength, and integration roadmap, Shanti 
Spintex is well positioned to capture emerging market opportunities and deliver sustained value 
to all stakeholders.”
