Managing Director, IZMO Ltd
Management Comment
“Performance in this quarter has been in line with expectations, continuing on our growth trajectory
steadily . We are seeing rising demand for our existing as well as new offerings across established and
new markets .
This quarter we added 78 clients in the US and 22 in Europe and the UK. This steady client accretion
reflects the scalability of our products and operations, which in turn, is a result of years of R&D,
development and our core competencies .
In the quarter ended 30th September 2025, we reported a 2.7% year-on-year growth in revenue at Rs.
60.1 crores . EBITDA excluding other income grew 42.4% year-on-year to Rs. 13.5 crores, while PAT was
reported at Rs. 12.6 crores . Addition of new clients was supported by synergies from Geronimo and our
subsidiary Izmo Microsystems (IMPL), to drive this growth. Increased adoption of AI helped boost
operational efficiencies, benefitting margins .
We recently launched a redesigned platform for izmoStock, our global auto imagery division, with
several new and useful features, further enhancing its utility for players in the auto sector . We also
launched Automotive AI Factory, a dedicated innovation hub to boost AI adoption in the auto industry .
Moreover, IMPL is making significant strides, such as a breakthrough in silicon photonics packaging, and
a Galvanic Isolated Hex-Bridge Inverter developed in-house. In fact, izmo recently received recognition
from DSIR, GoI, for our in-house R&D unit. We see tremendous potential in this line, from various verticals .
Overall, we are quite excited and optimistic about the ongoing year. I would like to thank the entire Izmo
team and all our stakeholders for their support, which drives the Company forward .”

Business Software Market
 Global business software & services market was valued 
at $389.86 billion in 2020 and forecasted to grow at 
CAGR of 11.3% during 2021-28
 Growing automation of business processes and increase 
in enterprise data are driving growth in this industry
 COVID-19 pandemic further expedited this growth as 
demand for SaaS based services and products increase 
across sectors
Silicon Photonics Industry
• Silicon photonics (incl. packaging) is a $2–3B market in 
2024 growing at 25–30% CAGR, projected to reach $8–10B 
by 2030.
• Photonic packaging overall exceeds $250B+ globally, with 
silicon-photonics as the fastest-growing segment.
• Explosive AI / data-centre growth is driving demand for 
high-bandwidth, low-power optical interconnects, 
making silicon-photonics packaging a core enabler of AI 
scale-up.
Market Scenario

Sources: Company
• Advanced Packaging TAM: ~$50B today, 
growing to ~$80B by 2030 (8–10% CAGR) 
driven by 2.5D/3D, chiplets, HBM, and co-
packaged optics.
• Silicon Photonics Surge: ~$2–3B market in 
2024, projected to reach $10B+ by 2030 (25–
30% CAGR), the fastest-growing packaging 
segment.
• AI & Data-Centre Demand: AI compute 
growth demands high-bandwidth, low-
power optical links—making silicon-
photonics packaging critical for next-gen AI 
systems.
• $2B today → $10B+ by 2030 (25–27% 
CAGR), one of the fastest-growing areas 
in advanced packaging.
• Growth led by AI/data-centre adoption
of 800G–1.6T optical links—lower power 
and latency than copper.
• Telecom, LiDAR and high-speed 
interconnects add to TAM, but AI is the 
strongest demand driver.
