Our revenue from operaƟons for the quarter stood at INR 138 crores, up to 53% YoY from 90 crores 
during the same quarter last year. Revenue growth was driven by higher oﬀ-take from insƟtuƟonal 
customers and improved product mix. EBITDA was INR 9.4 crores, up 104% YoY versus INR 4.6 crores 
in Q2FY25. EBITDA margin claiming at 6.8% versus 5.1% in Q2FY25. The improved in EBITDA was aided 
by cost opƟmizaƟon iniƟaƟves and eﬃcient raw material outsourcing.  
PAT margins came in at 1.7% quarter 2 ﬁnancial year 2026. Over the years, we conƟnue to invest in 
operaƟonal excellence, focusing on automaƟon, capacity uƟlizaƟon, and process eﬃciency to further 
enhance producƟvity. Looking ahead, our focus remains on strengthening long-term partnerships with 
mulƟ-global and domesƟc clients, enhancing process eﬃciency through automaƟon and conƟnuous 
improvement, expanding our value-added and organic product lines to capture evolving consumer

Hansh Singh 
Hello, thanks for the opportunity. Wanted to get some understanding on what are the key drivers 
behind the strong revenue and EBITDA growth in Q2 and H1 FY26 and are this sustainable revenue 
growth of 53% YoY and 67% on H1 basis, while EBITDA growth of, 100 plus. 
Ms. Manisha Gupta  
It is sustainable reason being we have increased our producƟon capacity because of this increase in 
the producƟon capacity; this revenue will be sustainable in future years also. 
Hansh Singh  
Understood. So, may I know the plan to maintain or improve proﬁtability and pricing I mean rising raw 
material or operaƟonal cost? 
Ms. Manisha Gupta  
Sir, with the increase in the producƟon, the raw material cost and overall cost will automaƟcally be 
decreased in that level. our EBITDA is increased only because of the cost opƟmizaƟon, and we are 
trying to increase the reduce at a later part also. We are taking steps so that the cost will be opƟmized 
at maximum extent. 
Hansh Singh  
I just wanted to understand more on the factors contribuƟng to the PAT level increase and how does 
the company plan to improve PAT margins further? 
Mr. Manisha Gupta  
Sir, in our industry, main cost is power and fuel, and we are trying to reduce the electricity cost by 
diﬀerent sources by applying the solar and other factors. Second cost is our admin cost because that 
producƟon has been increased, then at the same premises, then the administraƟon cost has been 
reduced. Third is employment cost.  
Mr. Vikas Goel 
And due to, fresh CapEx, at presently, interest cost is on the higher side. In future, our PAT will increase. 
Going forward, as our interest cost would decrease our PAT will see improvement. 
Hansh Singh  
Okay. Got it, sir that's helpful. Sir, also on the guidance in the outlook part, so what will be your revenue 
and proﬁtability guidance for the rest of FY26 & FY27, if you may highlight any ballpark number for 
that? 
Mr. Vikas Goel  
In future, approximate around 15% of the revenues will be up every YoY . If I say about 26-27, 
approximate, in FY25-26 we are going to close around INR 500 CR. In FY26-27, it is around INR 600 
crores and around FY27-28 is around INR 700 crores

I just wanted to know what is the current capacity uƟlizaƟon rate of the plant, and are there plans for 
capacity expansion further? 
Mr. Vikas Goel  
Presently, we are using around 65% of our capacity. We have 30% capacity more, to uƟlize in future. 
Yes, we have planned, but, in diﬀerent locaƟons that we will plan in next year. 
Hansh Singh  
Okay, sir understood. Thank you, sir so that's all from my side. I'll join back to you. 
Moderator  
Thank you, sir . The next quesƟon is from Mr . Prerak Dusab from AlternaƟve Investment Bank. Please 
go ahead, sir. 
Prerak Dusab 
Hello. First of all, congratulaƟons, sir, on the commendable results of September quarter. Just I have 
few quesƟons exports has been an important growth level for you. So can you please elaborate with 
geographies are we seeing most now? 
Mr. Vikas Goel  
Basically, export is banned from India in wheat and wheat products. Since 2022, there is no export 
from India of wheat and wheat products. Our main clients are local MNCs and local Indian player like 
ITC. And we our specializaƟon is specialized ﬂask for, like, pizzas, for chocolates, not normal bakery 
ﬂour. We are making specialized ﬂour for specialized requirement of customers. 
Prerak Dusab 
And sir, how has the working capital cycle moved in the last few quarters, especially in terms of 
receivable and inventory? 
Ms. Manisha Gupta  
The key raw material is wheat which is purchased during the quarter of April. If we talk about the Q1, 
the working capital uƟlizaƟon will be at the maximum level. If we talk about Q2, that will dip by 50% 
reason being that  at  Q1 we uƟlized maximum working capital and in Q2 it will be dropped by 50% 
because we procure wheat in the month of ﬁrst quarter for the later periods, for the rest of the 9 
months. That is why the working capital uƟlizaƟon in Q1 will be higher. Q2, it will be less than 50% and 
Q3, it will be less than 20% and in Q4, it will be minimum. 
Prerak Dusab 
Ma'am, H1 and H2, if we compare both, which half is beƩer for your company? 
Ms. Manisha Gupta  
Sir Q2.

Currently, our capacity is 710 MT per day and uƟlizaƟon is approximate 65% of the capacity.

The operaƟng margin will be sustainable?  
Mr. Vikas Goel  
Yes, that is sustainable. Rather, in future, it should be increased. 
Aniket Madhubani  
Increased to what percent? 
Mr. Vikas Goel  
Our business mostly dependents on wheat crop i.e. extra wheat crop or lesser wheat crop, market 
scenario will depend on the total quanƟty of wheat producƟon. That we can predict yearly in the 
month of February, March. 
Aniket Madhubani  
Okay. Got it. 
Moderator  
Thank you, sir. The next quesƟon will be from Mr. Hemang Pandiya, an Individual Investor . Please go 
ahead, sir. 
Hemang Pandiya 
Hi, sir. Good morning. CongratulaƟons for good set of numbers. Sir, I have three quesƟons. What is the 
target margin range over the next two to three years? 
Mr. Vikas Goel  
Target margin is double digit EBITDA. 
Hemang Pandiya 
Another quesƟon, is the company planning to raise any addiƟonal debt or equity for the expansion? 
Mr. Vikas Goel  
Presently, No. 
Hemang Pandiya 
How are receivables and payables be being managed to maintain liquidity? 
Ms. Manisha Gupta  
Receivables and payables are in, the liquidity is maintained by these receivables and payables. There 
is no issue in this. Secondly, liquidity is okay, we are trying to get a EBIDTA margin as to double digit, 
and there is no issue in receivables and payables, I hope.  
Hemang Pandiya 
Understood, ma'am. I have one more quesƟon. Non-current borrowing has risen INR 6,280 lakhs and 
current liabiliƟes are INR 18,941 lakhs. So, what is the debt repayment of this restructuring plan?  
7 
Megastar Foods Limited  
H1FY26 Earnings Conference Call                    12.11.2025 
Ms. Manisha Gupta  
Sir, there is no as such restructuring. The long-term borrowing is 62 crores and the short-term is INR 
111 crores. INR 111 crore includes mainly the working capital loan, that is the warehousing loan. And 
the long-term is INR 62 crores, which we are in good posiƟon to pay. As of now, the EBITDA is 6.8, and 
we are trying to get it in double digit. So, there is no issue in long term repayment. 
Hemang Pandiya 
Understood, ma'am. Inventory has increased signiﬁcantly from INR 38 crore in FY25 to INR 137 crores 
in H1 FY26. So, what is driving this?  
Ms. Manisha Gupta 
 Sir, as I have said, that wheat is a seasonal crop. We buy at maximum level in the month of April and 
May and the stock will be reduced by end of March. Reason being, the wheat crops enter In the month 
of April. The stock will be minimum by the end of March, that will be approximately 1 month crop. So, 
that is why the wheat is INR 38 crores. Now, at 30th September, the wheat, we will keep the wheat for 
rest three or four months. That is where the crop is, stock is 137. Second reason is that we have 
increased our producƟon capacity. Because of this increase in the producƟon capacity, we have to keep 
the wheat too. So, there are two reasons. We have kept the wheat for rest of four months. Secondly, 
the producƟon capacity has been gone more than double. The stock is also burdened more than 
double. 
Hemang Pandiya 
Okay. Got it, ma'am. So your 40% sales come from Punjab, and 14 to 15% come from Haryana. So is 
there any company strategy to diversify regionally or expand PAN India? 
Mr. Vikas Goel  
We are planning to increase our geographical situaƟon, according to our products demand in other 
states. 
Hemang Pandiya 
Understood, sir and is there any export expansion plan for the future? 
Ms. Vikas Goel  
Export presently totally banned from India, but presently India is suﬃcient stocks of wheat in 
government posiƟon. Maybe next year, government will open exports. 
Hemang Pandiya 
Okay. And one more quesƟon 60% revenue come from your top 10 brands. So, from your top brands 
is there any concrete plan to diversify your customer concentraƟon base? 
Mr. Vikas Goel 
Yes, we are starƟng our B2C brand very shortly. 
Hemang Pandiya

Can you please share the plan or something? 
Mr. Vikas Goel 
Plan is we are planning to launch our brand for Horita in the next ﬁnancial year. 
Hemang Pandiya 
One quesƟon regarding the uƟlizaƟon. Your capacity uƟlizaƟon is almost 85 to 86% from, reﬁned wheat 
ﬂour and 20% to 25% from another category. So, what is the plan to increase uƟlizaƟon across product 
line? 
Mr. Vikas Goel 
No, you are saying that from 100% wheat, the maximum reﬁned ﬂour (Maida) yield is about 75%. The 
remaining 25% becomes by-products such as bran and caƩle feed. 
Hemang Pandiya 
Okay, got it, thank you so much. 
Moderator  
Thank you, sir. The next quesƟon is from Aiysha from Value Worth Investment. Please go ahead, 
ma'am. 
Aiysha  
Thank you for the opportunity. My ﬁrst quesƟon is, what are the growth opportuniƟes and risks that 
management foresees in expanding the weak ﬂour consumpƟon market in India? 
Ms. Manisha Gupta  
As such, ma'am, wheat is a regular product. There is no risk as such. And as a company, we are 
expanding, and we are increasing our producƟon capacity. We will increase the capacity from 75% to 
85% to be have the orders and, wheat and the ﬂour is as such a product, as there is always a demand 
of the ﬂour product. To as if there is no risk in the wheat and the ﬂour product. 
Aiysha  
What are the steps the company is taking to diversify its customer base domesƟcally and 
internaƟonally? 
Ms. Manisha Gupta  
Ma'am, internaƟonally, we are planning to expand our product, which we will be most likely next year, 
we will start the export. As of now, export is banned by the government, but most likely next year or 
the year aŌer. Secondly, we have started the new products because this is a reﬁned ﬂour, specialized 
ﬂour. We are also trying to innovate more products day by day so that the customer base will increase., 
The product base will also increase. So there will be double diversiﬁcaƟon one product wise and 
secondly customer wise. Thirdly, the potenƟal of export stands once the ban is liŌed.  
Aiysha

Megastar Foods Limited  
H1FY26 Earnings Conference Call                    12.11.2025 
How is the company leveraging its digital distribuƟon and ecommerce to expand its customer base?  
Mr. Vikas Goel  
The reﬁned ﬂour is not a consumer product. Basically, the reﬁned ﬂour goes to insƟtuƟonal customers. 
Aiysha  
So how does Megastar ensure the quality control and maintain cerƟﬁcaƟons in a high-volume 
manufacturing environment? 
Mr. Vikas Goel  
Ma'am, we have a very qualiﬁed team in house. All departments and HOD are qualiﬁed. Then there is 
no issue of cerƟﬁcaƟon and other. We have customers like, Nestle, ITC, etc who regularly conducts  
regular audits. 
Aiysha  
So last quesƟon, what are the strategic prioriƟes for the leadership team in the next 2 to 3 years? 
Mr. Vikas Goel  
Basically, our total focus is on specialized ﬂour. The ﬂour India imports presently from other countries 
for which we are, making their replica in India. We are trying to make all the ﬂour for Indian 
requirements in India only.  
Aiysha  
Okay, sir. Thank you so much. 
Moderator  
Thank you. That will be the last quesƟon for the day. Now I hand over the ﬂoor to the management for 
the closing comments.
