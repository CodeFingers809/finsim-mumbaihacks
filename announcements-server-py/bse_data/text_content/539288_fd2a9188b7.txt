sequent government in June 
2024. As a result, the number 
of beneficiaries receiving the 18th instalment increased to 
9.59 crore, the statement 
observed. 
A special drive was con- 
ducted from September 21, 
2024, to clear the self-regis- 
tration pending cases. Under 
the drive since its inception, 
over 30 lakh pending self registration cases have been 
approved by the State/UT. 
This scheme stands out as 
one of the largest Direct 
Benefit Transfer (DBT) initia- 
tives globally, underscoring 
its monumental impact on 
facilitating financial support 
directly to the beneficiaries. 
With a commitment to inclu- 
sivity, it dedicates over 25 per 
cent of its benefits to women 
beneficiaries. 
A major factor behind the 
success of the scheme is 
India's robust digital infra- structure. With the integra- 
tion of Jan Dhan accounts, 
and  Commerce 
Colonel 
Industry 
Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, 
and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Jogaram Patel said 
the new department will act 
as a strong platform for dia- 
logue and  cooperation 
between the state govern- 
ment and the global 
Rajasthani diaspora. 
The department will 
develop a policy framework enabling Overseas 
Rajasthanis to benefit from 
state government schemes 
while addressing their griev- 
ances. Tt will also play a key role in  promoting 'Brand 
Rajasthan'  internationally 
through cultural, economic, 
and community outreach 
programmes. 
The department will 
organise Pravasi Rajasthani Diwas, Pravasi Rajasthani 
Samman  Samaroh, and 
exchange programmes for 
diaspora  communities. A dedicated portal will also be 
launched for registering dias- 
pora Rajasthani associations.

Odisha's 2036 
Vision: 
Minister 
BHUBANESWAR The 
Minister of State, Works 
Department, Prithiviraj raj 
Harichandan, on Wednesday, stressed that the success of 
widespread urbanisation is 
crucial to achieving the 
vision of a developed Odisha by 2036 Addressing the gathering 
on the second day of the two- 
day District Collectors and 
SPs  Conference here in 
Bhubaneswar, Harichandan 
emphasised the need for planned and  sustainable development of urban areas across_the state. He noted 
that the growth of cities 
accelerates  the economic 
progress of both the state 
the nation. The minister 
added that Prime Minister 
Narendra Modi and Chief 
Minister Mohan  Charan 
Majhi are prioritising the 
development of all sectors 
linked to urban growth. 
"Cities must be made engines of growth. Urbanisation 
plays a crucial role in the economic development of a district,” he said. 
Aadhaar, and mobile phones, every component of the 
scheme operates seamlessly online. 
Farmers can self-register, 
land records are digitally ver- ified, and payments are transferred directly to their 
bank accounts. State govern- 
ments have also played a cru- cial role in ensuring smooth implementation, helping cre- 
ate a unified and farmer- 
friendly delivery system. The scheme has further 
inspired the development of 
digital innovations such as 
Kisan eMitra, a voice-based 
chatbot, and  AgriStack, 
which aims to provide farm- ers with personalised and timely advisory ~services. Together, these advance- 
ments are helping to mod- 
ernise Indian agriculture and 
prepare it for the future, the 
statement added. 
On Wednesday, Prime 
Minister Narendra Modi 
released Rs 18,000 crore to 
a commitment made by the 
Chief Minister during last 
year's Pravasi Rajasthani Conclave. Colonel Rathore 
announced that the Cabinet 
has approved the Rajasthan 
Global Capability Centre 
Policy-2025, which seeks to 
establish the state as a 
prominent global innovation 
and investment hub. The pol- 
icy targets the establishment 
of over 200 GCCs by 2030, 
generating 1.5 lakh jobs and

lion GCC market.
