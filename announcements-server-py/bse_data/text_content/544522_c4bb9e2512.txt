A B Cotspin announces Order worth around ₹13.75 Crore for Supply of Cotton 
Yarn 
 
Bathinda – 18th November 2025 – A B Cotspin India Ltd. (NSE: ABCOTS, BSE: 544522), a leading textile 
manufacturer with over 25 years of industry expertise, announces an Order worth around ₹13.75 crore for 
supply of Cotton Yarn to be executed within 2 months. This order reinforces the company’s market 
position as a trusted supplier of high-quality cotton yarn, knitted fabrics, and eco-friendly products.  
India’s organic cotton exports are rising as global markets emphasize sustainable sourcing. Europe 
and North America are key drivers due to stringent environmental regulations and evolving consumer 
preferences. Leading international brands are collaborating with Indian organic cotton suppliers to 
ensure a stable supply of sustainable raw materials, fostering long-term commitments.  
India-US Trade Pact Nears First-Phase Completion: Commerce Secretary 
India’s engagement with the US on the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) is gaining momentum, with the 
initial phase, focused on reciprocal tariffs, moving toward completion. Commerce Secretary Rajesh 
Agrawal indicated that the ﬁrst segment of the pact is “near closure,” marking a signiﬁcant step forward 
in months of ongoing virtual discussions. 
Agrawal explained that the BTA has been structured into two components. One portion is expected to 
require a longer negotiation window due to its complexity, while the opening tranche centres on tariff-
related matters that both nations are eager to resolve quickly. 
“The part relating to reciprocal tariffs should happen sooner rather than later,” he noted, stating that rigid 
timelines remain unrealistic at this stage. 
Reduction in Tariffs will make Indian Textiles more competitive in USA leading to increased Exports.  
India's textile exports to 111 countries recorded a 10 per cent year-on-year growth during April-September, 
demonstrating remarkable resilience in the ﬁrst half of the ﬁnancial year despite global headwinds and 
tariff-related challenges in major markets, the government said. 
These 111 markets contributed USD 8,489.08 million during April-September 2025, compared to USD 
7,718.55 million in the previous year, reﬂecting a 10 per cent growth and an absolute increase of USD 770.3 
million, the textile ministry said. 
India's continued expansion into non-traditional markets reinforces the government's policy focus on 
export diversiﬁcation, value addition, and global market integration under the "Make in India" and 
"Aatmanirbhar Bharat" initiatives. 

 
 
The cabinet cleared the '25,000-cr Export Promotion Mission and '20,000 cr. additional collateral-free 
credit to support exporters grappling with global trade uncertainty. 
Priority support is being given to sectors such as textiles, leather, gems and jewellery, engineering goods, 
and marine products hit by US tariffs. 
The mission, which was announced in the budget, is spread over six years and seeks to help exporters get 
better access to credit and innovative ﬁnance tools, while also aiming to address the logistics cost 
disadvantage. The scheme also aims to help exporters tap new markets and deal with branding and 
warehousing issues overseas. 
Union Minister of Textiles Giriraj Singh on October 7, 2025 at the World Cotton Day 2025 celebrations in 
New Delhi said the government’s vision goes beyond expanding exports and textile markets, aiming to 
make India’s textile sector carbon-neutral by 2030. He highlighted the government’s goal of achieving a 
USD 350 billion textile industry, including USD 100 billion in exports, with sustainability at the heart of 
this growth. Minister of State Pabitra Margherita emphasized that the Kasturi Cotton initiative will 
contribute signiﬁcantly to the Government’s ‘5F’ (Farm–Fibre–Factory–Fashion–Foreign) vision and hinted 
at enhancing textile cooperation with Russia.  
 
The Co. expects to achieve Turnover of around ₹350 crores and EBITDA of ₹40-45 crores for FY 2025-
26.  
The equity shares of Company are now being traded on the Main Boards of both the National Stock 
Exchange Ltd. (NSE) and BSE Ltd. (BSE), effective from September 24, 2025.
