Independent Auditor's Limited Review Report on standalone unaudited 
financial results of Explicit Finance Limited for the quarter and half year ended 
30th September, 2025 pursuant to the Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read 
with Regulation 63(2) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended. 
Review Report to, 
The Board of Directors of 
Explicit Finance Limited 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of Unaudited Standalone 
Financial Results of Explicit Finance Limited ("the Company"), for the quarter 
and half year ended 30th September, 2025 ("the Statement"), being submitted 
by the Company pursuant to Regulation 33 of the Securities and Exchange Board 
of India ("SEBI") (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015, as amended. 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and 
approved by the Board of Directors, has been compiled from the related reviewed 
interim standalone financial information which has been prepared in accordance 
with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the Indian 
Accounting Standards 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" ("Ind AS 34"), prescribed 
under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with relevant rules issued 
thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our 
responsibility is to express conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on 
Review Engagements (SRE) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information 
Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform 
the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the financial statements 
are free of material misstatement. A review is limited, primarily to inquiries of 
Company's personnel responsible for financial and accounting matters, and 
analytical procedures applied to financial data. A review is substantially less 
assurance than an audit in accordance with Standards on Auditing specified 
under section 143(10) of the Companies Act and consequently does not enable 
us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that 
might be identified in an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, 
we do not express an audit opinion. 
4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that 
— causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance 
ith applicable Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under Section 133 of the
