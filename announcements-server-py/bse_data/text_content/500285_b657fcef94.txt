GURUGRAM, November 12, 2025: SpiceJet today announced its financial results for the 
quarter ended September 30, 2025 (Q2 FY26), reporting a net loss of INR 447.70 crore (ex-
forex), compared to a net loss of INR 424.26 crore in Q2 FY25. The results for the 
seasonally weak quarter were primarily driven by impact of recalibrating Dollar based 
future obligations along with carrying cost of grounded fleet and additional expenses 
incurred towards RTS. 
 
Continued airspace restrictions negatively impacted  operations and resulted in a sharp 
escalation in operating costs, further weighing on the quarter’s performance. 
 
On an EBITDA R (ex -forex) basis, the airline reported INR ( 203.80) crore in Q2 FY26, 
compared to INR (58.87) crore in Q2 FY25. Passenger Reven ue per Available Seat 
Kilometre (PAX RASK) stood at INR 4.04, while Passenger Load Factor (PLF) remained 
robust at 84.3%, underscoring SpiceJet’s strong brand affinity and customer focus. 
 
During the July -September period, SpiceJet undertook one of its most significant fleet 
enhancement programs, finalising lease agreements for 19 aircraft. These additions, 
coupled with the reactivation of grounded planes, will enable the airline to rapidly ramp 
up capacity and expand its international footprint in the festive and winter season. 
 
SpiceJet also strengthened its financial position through the successful completion of key 
restructuring initiatives. The airline fully completed the settlement and payment plan of 
$24 million with Credit Suisse and also secured $89.5 million in liquidity through the 
Carlyle Aviation settlement, unlocking vital maintenance reserves. These steps have 
enhanced liquidity, improved financial flexibility, and positioned the airline for sustained 
recovery. 
 
 
During the quarter, SpiceJet received two consecutive credit rating upgrades from Acuité 
Ratings, with its long -term rating revised to BB (Stable), reaffirming confidence in the 
airline’s turnaround strategy, financial discipline, and improving industry outlook. 
 
It signed a strategic interline agreement with Gulf Air, offering passengers wider global 
connectivity and seamless travel options.  
 
Ajay Singh, Chairman and Managing Director, SpiceJet, said, “The September quarter 
was a period of consolidation and groundwork for our next phase of growth. While the 
results reflect short-term costs related to fleet revival and expansion, these are strategic 
investments that will start yielding results from the current quarter onward. With aircraft 
additions already underway and our network expanding rapidly, SpiceJet is now on a 
clear trajectory toward s stronger operational and positive financial performance in the 
second half of the year.” 
 
“Our loads of over 84% confirm strong demand for the pro duct and with the winter 
schedule now in operations there are more high-yield routes in the pipeline. I am also 
delighted to welcome Sanjay Kumar back to the SpiceJet family – his leadership will play 
a key role in accelerating our transformation. Q3 marks the beginning of a new phase of 
scale, strength, and profitability for SpiceJet.”
