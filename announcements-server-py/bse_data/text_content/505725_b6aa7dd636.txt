Independent Auditor's Review Report on Unaudited Standalone Financial Results of 
Algoquant Fintech Limited (“the Company”) for the quarter and half year ended 30- 
September-2025 pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the Securities and Exchange Board of 
India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended 
To the Board of Directors of Algoquant Fintech Limited 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited standalone financial results 
(“the Statement”) of Algoquant Fintech Limited (“the Company”) for the quarter and 
half year ended 30-September-2025 attached herewith, being submitted by the Company 
pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (“the SEBI Listing Regulations”) 
including relevant circulars issued by the SEBI from time to time. 
This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company’s Management and approved 
by the Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standard 34, “Interim 
Financial Reporting” (“Ind AS 34”), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 
2013 (“the Act”), and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and is in 
compliance with the presentation and disclosure requirements of Regulation 33 of the 
SEBI Listing Regulations, including relevant circulars issued by the SEBI from time to time. 
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India. This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate 
assurance as to whether the Statement is free of material misstatement. A review of 
interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of the Company’s 
personnel responsible for financial and accounting matters and applying analytical and 
other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted 
in accordance with Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the 
Companies Act, 2013 and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we 
would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. 
Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes 
us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the 
recognition and measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under Section 
133 of the Act, and other accounting principles generally accepted in india, has not 
disclosed the information required to be disclosed in accordance with the requirements 
of Regulation 33 of the SEBI Listing Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be 
disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement. 
A Limited Liability Partnership with LLP Registration No. AAM-4855
5. We draw attention to note 3 to the accompanying Statement, which describes that the 
Company has given effect to the Composite Scheme of Arrangement ("the approved 
Scheme") between the Company, the holding company, Algoquant Investments Private 
Limited (hereinafter referred to as Amalgamating Company or AIPL) and Growth Securities 
Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as Demerged Company or GSPL) and their 
shareholders and creditors for the amalgamation of AIPL with the Company and 
amalgamation of Stock Broking Business of GSPL, referred to as "the Demerged 
undertaking" per the Approved Scheme, into the Company on a going concern basis with 
effect from the appointed date of 01-April-2023, as approved by the Hon'ble National 
Company Law Tribunal (Ahmedabad) (NCLT) vide its order dated 03-October-2024 in 
accordance with the accounting treatment prescribed in the scheme which is in line with 
the accounting principles as laid down in Appendix C to Ind AS 103, ‘Business Combinations. 
Accordingly, the unaudited standalone financial results of corresponding period 
presented, for the quarter and half year ended 30-September-2024, in the accompanying 
Statement have been restated. Our conclusion on the Statement is not modified in respect 
of this matter.

Independent Auditor's Review Report on Statement of Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results of 
the Algoquant Fintech Limited (“the Company”) for the quarter and half year ended 30- 
September-2025 pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended 
Tothe Board of Directors of Algoquant Fintech Limited 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results 
(“the Statement”) of Algoquant Fintech Limited (“the Holding Company”) and its subsidiaries 
(the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”) for the quarter 
and half year ended 30-September-2025 attached herewith, being submitted by the Holding 
Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (“the SEBI Listing Regulations”) 
including relevant circulars issued by the SEBI from time to time. 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Holding Company’s Management and approved 
by the Holding Company’s Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the 
recognition and measurement principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standard 34, 
“Interim Financial Reporting” (“Ind AS 34”), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies 
Act, 2013 as amended, read with relevant rules issued there under and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India and is in compliance with the presentation and disclosure 
requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI Listing Regulations, including relevant circulars 
issued by the SEBI from time to time. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the 
Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as 
to whether the Statement is free of material misstatement. A review of interim financial 
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and 
accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing 
specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013 and consequently does not enable 
us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be 
identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
We also performed procedures in accordance with the Master Circular issued by the Securities 
and Exchange Board of India under Regulation 33(8) of the Listing Regulations, to the extent 
applicable. 
4. The Statement includes the results of following entity: 
Name of the entity . Relationship 
Growth Global Securities (IFSC) Private Limited | Wholly owned subsidiary 
Algoquant Global Securities Private Limited | Wholly owned subsidiary 
AQ Capital Services Private Limited Subsidiary 
A Limited Liability Partnership with LLP Registration No. AAM-4855
5. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies 
Act, 2013 as amended, read with relevant rules issued there under and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be 
disclosed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI Listing Regulations, 
including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material 
misstatement. 
6. The accompanying Statement includes the unaudited interim financial results and other 
financial information, in respect of one subsidiary, whose unaudited interim financial results 
include total assets of Rs.4.00 Lakh as at 30- September-2025, total revenues of Rs. Nil, total 
net loss before and after tax of Rs. 0.04 Lakh, total comprehensive income of Rs. (0.04) Lakh, 
for the quarter and half year ended 30-September-2025, and net cash inflows of Rs.4.00 Lakh 
for the half year ended 30- September-2025. 
The unaudited interim financial results and other unaudited financial information of the 
subsidiary has not been audited/reviewed by their auditor and has been approved and furnished 
to us by the Management and our conclusion on the Statement, in so far as it relates to the 
affairs of the subsidiary, is based solely on such unaudited interim financial results and other 
unaudited financial information. According to the information and explanations given to us by 
the Management, these interim financial results are not material to the Group. Our conclusion 
on the Statement is not modified in respect of this matter. 
7. We draw attention to note 3 to the accompanying Statement, which describes that the Company 
has given effect to the Composite Scheme of Arrangement ("the approved Scheme") between 
the Company, the holding company, Algoquant Investments Private Limited (hereinafter 
referred to as Amalgamating Company or AIPL) and Growth Securities Private Limited 
(hereinafter referred to as Demerged Company or GSPL) and their shareholders and creditors 
for the amalgamation of AIPL with the Company and amalgamation of Stock Broking Business 
of GSPL, referred to as "the Demerged undertaking” per the Approved Scheme, into the 
Company on a going concern basis with effect from the appointed date of 01-April-2023, as 
approved by the Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal (Ahmedabad) (NCLT) vide its order 
dated 03-October-2024 in accordance with the accounting treatment prescribed in the scheme 
which is in line with the accounting principles as laid down in Appendix C to Ind AS 103, ‘Business 
Combinations. Accordingly, the statement of unaudited consolidated financial results for the 
corresponding quarter and half year ended 30-September-2024 have been prepared in 
accordance with the approved scheme and Ind AS 103 'Business Combinations’. Our conclusion 
on the Statement is not modified in respect of this matter.
