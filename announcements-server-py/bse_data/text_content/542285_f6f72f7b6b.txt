!ndependent Auditor's Review Report on the Quarterly and Year to date Unaudited Standalone Financial
Results of the Axita Cotton Limited ("the Company") pursuant to regulation 33 and 52 of the SEBI (Listing
Obligation and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended
To,
The Board of Directors,
Axita Cotton Limited,
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited standalone financial results of Axita
Cotton Limited ("the Company") for the quarter ended 30thSeptember, 2025 being submitted by
the Company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 and 52 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations,20t5, as amended ("the listing Regulations").
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and approved by the
Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and
measurement principles laid down in the lndian Accounting Standard 34, "lnterim Financial
Reporting" ("lnd AS 34") prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 as amended,
read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in
lndia and in compliance with Regulations 33 and 52 of the Listing Regulations. Our responsibility is
to issue a report on these financial statements based on our review.
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review
Engagements (SRE) 2410 'Review of lnterim Financial lnformation Performed by the lndependent
Auditor of the Entity' issued by the lnstitute of Chartered Accountants of lndia (lCAl). This standard
requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the
Statement is free from material misstatement. A review of interim financial information consists of
making inquiries, primarily of the Company's personnel responsible for financial and accounting
matters and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing specified under Section
143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013 and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that
rfOI[tBtY, I
@
C\
we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit.
we do not express an audit opinion.

4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to
believe that the accompanying statement, prepared in accordance with applicable lndian
Accounting Standards (lnd-AS) prescribed under Section L33 of the Companies Act, 2013, as
amended read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally
accepted in lndia, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of
Regulations 33 and 52 of the Listing Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be
disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
