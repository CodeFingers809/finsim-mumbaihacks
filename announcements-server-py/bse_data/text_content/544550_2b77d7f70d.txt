MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY
INVESTOR PRESENTATION | Q2 - FY 2025-26 |
Enhanced growth in Energy Segment driven by strong Order Book
Pace Digitek delivered outstanding H1 FY 2025-26 results with revenue of ₹ 9,005 Mn and PAT of ₹ 1,226 Mn
(13.61% margins). Q2 momentum was particularly strong— ₹ 5,334 Mn revenue (+45% Q-o-Q) with PAT of ₹ 679
Mn (12.72% margins)—reflecting robust demand for our integrated BESS and telecom infrastructure solutions.
Due to the seasonal nature of the business, H1 accounts for 1/3 of FY revenue & H2 for 2/3 of the FY revenue.
S t r a t e g i c  O r d e r  W i n s  a n d  O r d e r  B o o k  S t r e n g t h
We secured landmark contracts validating our market position: ₹ 1159 Cr SECI contract for containerized
BESS (India's largest single-location project) and ₹ 186 Cr O&M agreement with Tata Teleservices. Our
order book of ₹ 9,135 Cr provides multi-year visibility and demonstrates consistent demand across energy
and telecom segments.
Capacity Expansion Positioning for Next-Decade Growth
We are doubling BESS containerized capacity from 5 GWh to 10 GWh with an integrated
manufacturing facility underway. This backward integration delivers cost optimization, improved 
margins through local value addition, and strong competitive positioning under India's "Make in India" 
initiative—aligning perfectly with the country's renewable energy ambitions.
Confident Growth Trajectory and Investor Opportunity
We project FY 2025-26 revenue of ₹ 2,600- ₹ 2700 Cr at 12% PAT margins, scaling to
₹ 3,100 Cr - ₹ 3,200 in FY 2027 at 11% margins. This confidence is grounded in strong order
visibility, energy transition tailwinds, telecom infrastructure consolidation, and our proven
execution capabilities—positioning Pace Digitek as a preferred partner in India's
infrastructure transformation.
