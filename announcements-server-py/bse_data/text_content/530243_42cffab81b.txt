MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS REPORT 
 
 Post-Merger Integration, Regulatory Progress, and Strategic Outlook: 
Subsequent to the financial year-end, the Company has undertaken significant steps to 
operationalise the merger of Ratnakar Securities Private Limited with Ratnakar Securities Limited 
(formerly known as Mangalya Soft-tech Limited). Pursuant to the approval of the Hon’ble National 
Company Law Tribunal dated 26/06/2025, the Company thereafter completed all actions required 
for giving effect to the amalgamation. In this regard, the Company has carried out the necessary 
compliances under the Companies Act, 2013 and applicable stock exchange regulations, including 
issuance and allotment of shares, effecting the change of name, undertaking the required corporate 
actions, and updating statutory and regulatory records to reflect the post-merger structure. 
 Operationalisation of Merger, Regulatory approvals and Future Growth Strategy: 
 
Following the effectiveness of the scheme, the Company has initiated the process of obtaining fresh 
registration from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) as a Stock Broker under the SEBI 
(Stock Brokers) Regulations, 1992 read with relevant regulations. This registration is critical for 
transferring and commencing the broking operations of Ratnakar Securities Private Limited within 
the merged entity. The applications for registration and membership with other market 
infrastructure institutions, including the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE), National 
Securities Depository Limited (NSDL), NSE Clearing Limited, Indian Clearing Corporation Limited 
(ICCL), and the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), have already been prepared and kept 
ready for submission. These applications will be formally filed immediately upon receipt of the fresh 
SEBI Stock Broker Registration, ensuring a seamless transition of business activities into the 
Company. 
 
 Merger Implementation,Regulatory transition, Relisting Efforts, and Strategic Business Expansion: 
In parallel, the Company is progressing with the procedural requirements for revocation of 
suspension of trading of its equity shares on BSE Limited. Completion of this process is expected to 
pave the way for re-listing of the Company’s equity shares, thereby enhancing transparency and 
enabling wider participation by investors in the Company’s future growth. 
 Post-Merger Developments and roadmap for Broking and Financial Services Business Expansion: 
Looking ahead, the financial year marks the beginning of a renewed and strategic growth journey 
for Ratnakar Securities Limited. The Company intends to strengthen and scale up its equity broking 
business by offering both online and offline trading facilities, supported by advanced technological 
platforms to enhance client experience and operational efficiency. In addition, the Company plans 
to accelerate the expansion of its financial product distribution vertical by deploying additional 
resources for the distribution of mutual funds, fixed deposits, bonds, and other investment 
products, leveraging digital tools for wider reach and sharper analytics. Management remains 
committed to executing a robust growth strategy in line with the IBC Resolution Plan, with an 
overarching objective of creating long-term value for all stakeholders.

evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion 
on the Standalone financial statements. 
Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon 
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of other 
information. The other information obtained at the date of this auditor’s report is 
information included in the Board of Directors’ report, but does not include the 
Standalone financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. 
Our opinion on the Standalone financial statements does not cover the other 
information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit of the Standalone financial statements, our responsibility 
is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information 
is materially inconsistent with the Standalone financial statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material 
misstatement of this other information we are required to report that fact. We have 
nothing to report in this regard. 
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the 
Financial Statements 
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) 
of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) with respect to the preparation of these 
Standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, 
financial performance including other comprehensive income, changes in equity and 
cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, including Ind AS specified under section 133 of the Act. This 
responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance 
with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for 
preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of 
appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal 
financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of 
the Standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
In preparing the Standalone financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible 
for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to 
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial 
reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the  Standalone 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.  
 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone financial 
statements. 
 
 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and 
maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
 
 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control. 
 
 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 
143(3)(i) of the Companies Act, 2013, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the company has adequate internal financial controls system 
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls 
 
 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness 
of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. 
 
 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis 
of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signi ficant doubt 
on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a 
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the Standalone financial statements or, if such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on 
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going 
concern. 
 
 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the  Standalone 
financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the  Standalone 
financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner 
that achieves fair presentation.

Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements 
that, individually or in aggregate, makes i t probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable user of the  Standalone Financial Statements may be 
influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning 
the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate 
the effect of any identified misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements. 
 
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any 
significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 
 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied 
with relevant ethical re quirements regarding independence, and to communicate with 
them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.  
 
From the matters communicated with those charged wit h governance, we determine

these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public 
disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine 
that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest

obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting 
A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting with 
reference to the  Standalone Financial statements and the preparation of  Standalone 
financial statements for external purpo ses in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A Company’s internal financial control over financial reporting 
includes those policies and procedures that  
 
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;  
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of Standalone financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being 
made only in accordance with authorization  of Management and Directors of the 
Company; and  
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the Standalone financial statements. 
 
 
 
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, 
material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting 
to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial 
reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

3.2 Impairment of non-financial assets
At the end of each reporting period, The Company reviews the carrying amounts of non-financial assets, other than
deferred tax assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If
any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of such asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the
impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, The Company
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. Each CGU represents the
smallest Company of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets
or CGUs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to
individual CGUs, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest Company of CGUs for which a reasonable and consistent
allocation basis can be identified. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU for which the estimates of
future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
Depreciable amount for assets is the cost of an assets less its estimated residual value. Based on management’s
evaluation, useful life prescribed in Schedule II of the act represent actual useful life of Property, Plant and Equipment.
Accordingly, The Company has used useful lives as mentioned in Schedule II of the Act to provide depreciation of
different class of its Property, Plant and Equipment. The Company provides depreciation on reducing balance method as
per the useful life mentioned in Schedule II of the Act. Any change in estimate is accounted on prospective basis.
The estimated useful lives of Property, Plant and Equipment are as follows : 
Depreciation on additions is being provided on pro rata basis from the date of such additions. Depreciation on assets
sold, discarded, disabled or demolished during the period is being provided up to the date in which such assets are sold,
discarded, disabled or demolished. 
Items of property, Plant and Equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses, if any. Cost is inclusive of freight, duties, taxes or levies (net of recoverable taxes) and any directly attributable cost
of bringing the assets to their working condition for intended use.

3.3 Financial Instruments
(1) Initial Recognition and Measurements
(2) Classification and Subsequent Measurements
(a) Financial Assets
A financial asset and financial liability is initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to
the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair
value through profit and loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as
appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial
liabilities at fair value through profit and loss are recognised immediately in the Standalone statement of Profit and Loss.
Where the fair value of a financial asset or financial liability at initial recognition is different from its transaction price, the
difference between the fair value and the transaction price is recognized as a gain or loss in the Standalone statement of
Profit and Loss at initial recognition if the fair value is determined through a quoted market price in an active market for
an identical asset (i.e. level 1 input) or through a valuation technique that uses data from observable markets (i.e. level 2
input).
In case the fair value is not determined using a level 1 or level 2 input as mentioned above, the difference between the
fair value and transaction price is deferred appropriately and recognized as a gain or loss in the Standalone statement of
Profit and Loss only to the extent that such gain or loss arises due to a change in factor that market participants take into
account when pricing the financial assets or financial liability.
Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at transaction price.
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified based on assessment of business model in which
they are held. This assessment is done for portfolio of the financial assets. The relevant categories are as below:
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU ) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of
the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Standalone
Statement of Profit and Loss. Impairment loss recognised in respect of a CGU is allocated to reduce the carrying amounts
of the other assets of the CGU (or Company of CGUs) on a pro rata basis. 
Reversalofimpairmentlossesrecognisedinearlieryearsisrecordedwhenthereisanindicationthattheimpairment
losses recognised for the asset/cash generating unit no longer exist or have decreased. However, the increase in carrying
amount of an asset due to reversal of an impairment loss is recognised to the extent it does not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined (net of depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for that
asset/cash generating unit in earlier years. Reversal of impairment loss is directly recognised in the Standalone statement
of Profit and Loss.
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity
instrument of another entity. The financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet when The Company becomes
a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. The Company determines the classification of its
financial instruments at initial recognition.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU ) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of 
the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Standalone 
Statement of Profit and Loss. Impairment loss recognised in respect of a CGU is allocated to reduce the carrying amounts 
of the other assets of the CGU (or Company of CGUs) on a pro rata basis. 
Reversal of impairment losses recognised in earlier years is recorded when there is an indication that the impairment 
losses recognised for the asset/cash generating unit no longer exist or have decreased. However, the increase in carrying 
amount of an asset due to reversal of an impairment loss is recognised to the extent it does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined (net of depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for that 
asset/cash generating unit in earlier years. Reversal of impairment loss is directly recognised in the Standalone statement 
of Profit and Loss. 
3.3 Financial Instruments 
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity 
instrument of another entity. The financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet when The Company becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. The Company determines the classification of its 
financial instruments at initial recognition. 
(1) Initial Recognition and Measurements 
A financial asset and financial liability is initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to 
the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair 
value through profit and loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as 
appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial 
liabilities at fair value through profit and loss are recognised immediately in the Standalone statement of Profit and Loss. 
Where the fair value of a financial asset or financial liability at initial recognition is different from its transaction price, the 
difference between the fair value and the transaction price is recognized as a gain or loss in the Standalone statement of 
Profit and Loss at initial recognition if the fair value is determined through a quoted market price in an active market for 
an identical asset (i.e. level 1 input) or through a valuation technique that uses data from observable markets (i.e. level 2 
input). 
In case the fair value is not determined using a level 1 or level 2 input as mentioned above, the difference between the 
fair value and transaction price is deferred appropriately and recognized as a gain or loss in the Standalone statement of 
Profit and Loss only to the extent that such gain or loss arises due to a change in factor that market participants take into 
account when pricing the financial assets or financial liability. 
Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at transaction price. 
(2) Classification and Subsequent Measurements 
(a) Financial Assets 
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified based on assessment of business model in which 
they are held. This assessment is done for portfolio of the financial assets. The relevant categories are as below:

(ii) At fair value through Other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
(iii) At fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL)
(iv) Investment in Equity Instruments
(v) Impairment of Financial assets
Financial assets which are not measured at amortised cost or OCI and are held for trading are measured at FVTPL. Fair
value changes related to such financial assets are recognised in the Standalone statement of Profit and Loss.
Based on The Company’s business model, The Company has classified its securities held for trade,Investment in Equity
Shares and Investment in Mutual Funds at FVTPL.
Investment in Subsidiaries, Associates and Joint ventures are out of scope of Ind AS 109 and hence, The Company has
accounted for its investment in Subsidiaries at cost.
All other equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109, are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for
trading are classified as at FVTPL. For equity instruments other than held for trading, The Company has irrevocable option
to present in Other Comprehensive Income subsequent changes in the fair value. The Company makes such election on
an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable. 
 - the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and 
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
A financial asset is measured at FVTOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL: 
• theassetisheldwithina businessmodelwhoseobjectiveisachievedbybothcollectingcontractualcashflowsand
selling financial assets; and 
• the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at fair
value through profit or loss (FVTPL):-
Where The Company classifies equity instruments as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding
dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts of profit or loss from OCI to Standalone
statement of Profit and Loss, even on sale of investment. 
The Company assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its assets carried at
amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit
risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased significantly, twelve month ECL is used to provide for
impairment loss, otherwise lifetime ECL is used. 
However, only in case of trade receivables, The Company applies the simplified approach which requires expected
lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.

(i) At amortised cost:
(ii) At Fair Value through Profit and Loss:
All financial liabilities of The Company are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method
or at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities that are not held-for-trading and are not designated as at FVTPL are measured at amortised cost at the
end of subsequent accounting periods. The carrying amounts of financial liabilities that are subsequently measured at
amortised cost are determined based on the effective interest method. Under the effective interest method, the future
cash payments are exactly discounted to the initial recognition value using the effective interest rate. The cumulative
amortization using the effective interest method of the difference between the initial recognition amount and the
maturity amount is added to the initial recognition value (net of principal repayments, if any) of the financial liability over
the relevant period of the financial liability to arrive at the amortized cost at each reporting date. The corresponding
effect of the amortization under effective interest method is recognized as interest expense over the relevant period of
the financial liability. The same is included under finance cost in the Standalone statement of Profit and Loss. 
Fair value changes related to such financial liabilities are recognised in the Standalone statement of Profit and Loss.

A financial liability may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if: 
• the financial liability whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with The Company’s
documented risk management.
Expected credit losses rate the weighted average of credit losses with the respective risks of default occurring as the
weights. Credit loss is the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to The Company in accordance with
the contract and all the cash flows that The Company expects to receive (i.e. all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original
effective interest rate. The Company estimates cash flows by considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument
through the expected life of that financial instrument.

rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which The Company neither transfers nor retains
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control of the financial asset. 
On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of
the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity is recognised in the Standalone statement of Profit and Loss if such

through the expected life of that financial instrument. 
Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the 
assets. 
(vi) Derecognition of Financial Assets 
The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, 
or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and 
rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which The Company neither transfers nor retains 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control of the financial asset. 
On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of

gain or loss would have otherwise been recognised in the Standalone statement of Profit and Loss on disposal of that 
financial asset. 
(b) Financial Liabilities 
All financial liabilities of The Company are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method 
or at FVTPL. 
(i) At amortised cost: 
Financial liabilities that are not held-for-trading and are not designated as at FVTPL are measured at amortised cost at the 
end of subsequent accounting periods. The carrying amounts of financial liabilities that are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost are determined based on the effective interest method. Under the effective interest method, the future 
cash payments are exactly discounted to the initial recognition value using the effective interest rate. The cumulative 
amortization using the effective interest method of the difference between the initial recognition amount and the 
maturity amount is added to the initial recognition value (net of principal repayments, if any) of the financial liability over 
the relevant period of the financial liability to arrive at the amortized cost at each reporting date. The corresponding 
effect of the amortization under effective interest method is recognized as interest expense over the relevant period of 
the financial liability. The same is included under finance cost in the Standalone statement of Profit and Loss. 
Trade and other payables are recognised at the transaction cost, which is its fair value, and subsequently measured at 
amortised cost. 
(ii) At Fair Value through Profit and Loss: 
A financial liability may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if: 
e such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise 
arise; 
e the financial liability whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with The Company’s 
documented risk management. 
Fair value changes related to such financial liabilities are recognised in the Standalone statement of Profit and Loss.

3.4 Revenue Recognition
Revenue (other than for those items to which Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments are applicable) is measured at fair value of
the consideration received or receivable. Ind AS 115 Revenue from contracts with customers outlines a single
comprehensive model of accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. 
The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, The Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled
or have expired. An exchange with a lender of debt instruments with substantially different terms is accounted for as an
extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. Similarly, a substantial
modification of the terms of an existing financial liability is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial
liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial
liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in the Standalone statement of Profit and
Loss.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset when The Company has a legally enforceable right (not contingent on
future events) to off-set the recognised amounts either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the
liabilities simultaneously.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its
liabilities. Equity instruments issued by The Company are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Debt and equity instruments issued by The Company are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance
with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument as
per the relevant standards. Ordinary shares are classified as Equity when The Company has an un-conditional right to
avoid delivery of cash or another financial asset, that is, when the dividend and repayment of capital are at the sole and
absolute discretion of The Company and there is no contractual obligation whatsoever to that effect.

Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the reporting period in
accordance with the Income-tax Act, 1961 enacted in India and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in
respect of previous years. The amount of current tax reflects the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or
received after considering the uncertainty, if any, related to income taxes. It is measured using tax rates (and tax laws)
enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date. Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset only if there 
is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts, and it is intended to realise the asset and settle the
liability on a net basis or simultaneously. 
Employee benefits include short term employee benefits, provident fund, employee’s state insurance, and gratuity 
All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short term employee
benefits and they are recognized in the period in which the employee renders the related service. The Company
recognizes the undiscounted amount of short term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for services
rendered as a liability (accrued expense) after deducting any amount already paid. 
The Company’s contribution to Provident Fund, Employee State Insurance Scheme are considered as defined contribution
plans and are charged as an expense based on the amount of contribution required to be made and when services are
rendered by the employees. The Company does not carry any further obligations, apart from the contributions made on a
monthly basis. 
The Company provides for the gratuity, a defined benefit plan (the “”Gratuity Plan””) covering eligible employees in
accordance with the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump sum payment to vested employees
at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee’s
salary and the tenure of employment. The Company’s liability is actuarially determined (using the Projected Unit Credit
method) at the end of each year. The Company's liability is un-funded. Re-measurements of the net defined benefit
liability comprising actuarial gains and losses (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit
liability) and, are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income. Such re-measurements are not reclassified to the

is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts, and it is intended to realise the asset and settle the 
liability on a net basis or simultaneously.

(ii) Deferred tax :
3.7 Provisions, Contingent liabilities and Contingent Asset:
3.8 Leases
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
3.9 Cash and Cash Equivalents
Deferred tax is recognised for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying values of
assets and liabilities in Standalone Financial Statements and their respective tax bases at the reporting date, using the tax
rates and laws that are enacted or substantially enacted as on reporting date. The measurement of deferred tax reflects
the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which The Company expects, at the reporting date, to
recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is also recognised in respect of carried
forward tax losses and tax credits subject to the assessment of reasonable certainty of recovery. Deferred tax assets and
deferred tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off assets against liabilities representing
current tax and where the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to taxes on income levied by the same
governing taxation laws. Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside the Standalone statement of Profit and Loss is
recognised outside with the underlying items i.e. either in the statement of other comprehensive income or directly in
equity as relevant.
Provisions are recognised when The Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it
is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate
of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the
risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash
flows (representing the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet
date) at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
liability. When The Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance
contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The
expense relating to a provision is presented in the Standalone statement of Profit and Loss net of any reimbursement.
The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost. Expected future operating losses are not provided for.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised but are disclosed in the notes. Contingent assets are not recognised but are
disclosed in the notes where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with an
original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash and cash
equivalents for the purpose of Statement of Cash Flow comprise cash and cheques in hand, bank balances, demand
deposits with banks where the original maturity is three months or less.
The Company applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases that have a
lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the
lease of low-value assets recognition exemption that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-term
leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

4. Critical Accounting Estimates And Judgements:
4.1  Business Model Assessment: 
4.2  Fair Value Of Financial Instrument: 
The fair value of financial instruments is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
an orderly transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under current market
conditions (i.e., an exit price) regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation
technique. When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be
derived from active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of
valuation models. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not
feasible, estimation is required in establishing fair values. Judgements and estimates include considerations of liquidity
and model inputs related to items such as credit risk (both own and counterparty), funding value adjustments,
correlation and volatility.
Some of the Company's assets and liabilities are measured at fair value for financial reporting purposes. Fair value is the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another
valuation technique.
Fair value measurements under Ind AS are categorised into Level 1, 2, or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the
fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety,
which are described as follows:
Classification and measurement of financial assets depends on the results of the SPPI (Solely Payments of Principal and
Interest) and the business model test. The Company determines the business model at a level that reflects how
Companys of financial assets are managed together to achieve a particular business objective. This assessment includes
judgement reflecting all relevant evidence including how the performance of the assets is evaluated and their
performance measured, the risks that affect the performance of the assets and how these are managed.
The Company monitors financial assets measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income
that are derecognised prior to their maturity to understand the reason for their disposal and whether the reasons are
consistent with the objective of the business for which the asset was held. Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), where
the assets are managed in accordance with an approved investment strategy that triggers purchase and sale decisions
based on the fair value of such assets. Such assets are subsequently measured at fair value, with unrealised gains and
losses arising from changes in the fair value being recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which
they arise.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make estimates, judgements
and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
(including contingent liabilities) and disclosures as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Accounting estimates
and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and could change from period to period. Appropriate
changes in estimates are recognised in the periods in which the Company becomes aware of the changes in
circumstances surrounding the estimates. Any revisions to accounting estimates are recognized prospectively in the
period in which the estimate is revised and future periods. Following are estimates and judgements that have significant
impact on the carrying amount of assets and liabilities at each balance sheet:

The significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are the discount rate, the salary growth rate and the average life
expectancy. The assumptions used for the valuation of the defined benefit obligation are as follows:
Estimates of future salary increase takes into account: inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors, such as supply and demand in the employment
market The plan exposes the Company to significant actuarial risks such as interest rate risk and inflation risk: 
Inflation risk - A significant proportion of the defined benefit liability is linked to inflation. An increase in the inflation rate will increase the Company's liability. 
Interest rate risk-The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated using a discount rate prevailing market yields of Indian government securities. A
decrease in discount rate will increase the Company's defined benefit liability.

 (vii) Sensitivity analysis in respect of the actuarial assumptions used in calculation of defined benefit obligation is given below:
Year 4
Year 5
Year 6 to Year 10
Particulars
Sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in Defined Benefit Obligation in isolation and assuming there are no other changes in market
conditions at the accounting date. In presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligations has been calculated using the 
Projected Unit Credit Method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability
recognised in the balance sheet. This analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in
the assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
(viii) The weighted average duration of the benefit obligation as at March 31, 2025 is 16 years. (as at March 31, 2024 is 16 years)

39 Financial Risk Management, Objective and Policies
Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in the Balance Sheet are Companyed into three levels of a fair valuehierarchy, The three levels are
defined based on the observability of significant inputs to the measurement, as follows:
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly.
Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Fair value of the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

(a) Credit Risk:
CreditriskreferstoriskthatacounterpartywilldefaultonitscontractualobligationsresultinginfinanciallosstoTheCompany.CreditRiskarisesprincipally
from The Company's cash and bank balances, trade receivables, investments, securities held for trade, loans, and security deposits. The carrying amounts of
financial assets represent the maximum credit risk exposure. Credit risk assessment on various components is described below: 
(i) Trade receivables The Company's trade receivables primarily include receivables from asset management companies (AMCs) for services provided, 
receivable from stock exchanges (for trade executed on behalf of customers) as well as clients and receivable from insurance companies. The Company 
has not made any provision on ECL on account of receivables from AMCs, Stock exchanges and Insurance companies. The Company's management as 
establised accounts receivable policy under which customer accounts are regularly monitored. The Company has a dedicated risk management team, 
which monitors the positions, exposures and margins on a continuous basis.
(ii) Cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits, investments and Securities held for trade The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents, bank 
deposits, investment, and securities held for trade with reputed banks, financial institutions, and corporates. The credit risk on these instruments is 
limited because the counterparties are banks and high credit rated financial institutions and corporates assigned by credit rating agencies.
(iii) Security Deposits and Loans This consists of loans given to Employees and Security Deposits given to lessors as well as to utility providers like 
Electricity companies. These carries limited credit risk based on the financial position of parties and Company's historical experience of dealing with these 
parties.
(iv) Expected Credit Loss (ECL): The Company follows simplified ECL method in case of Trade Receivables and The Company recognises lifetime expected 
losses for all trade receivables that do not constitute a financing transaction. The Company assesses the provision for ECL on each reporting dates. For the 
purpose of computation of ECL, the term default implies an event where amount due towards margin requirement and/or mark to market losses for 
which the client was unable to provide funds/collaterals, within 90 days of its due, to bridge the shortfall, the same is termed as margin call triggered. The 
Company assesses allowance for expected credit losses for Loans and other financial assets. The ECL allowance is based upon 12 months expected credit 
losses. These carries very minimal credit risk based on the financial position of parties and Company's historical experience of dealing with these parties. 
Credit Risk on Other Financial assets is considered insignificant considering the nature of such assets and absence of counterparty risk.

financial assets. The Company's approach in managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities. In doing this, management
considers both normal and stressed conditions. The Company also monitors the level of expected cash inflows on trade and other receivables together with
expected cash outflows on trade and other payables. The Company has established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management
of the Company's short-term, medium-term, and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements. The Company manages liquidity risk by
maintaining adequate reserves and by continuously monitoring cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
(iii) Interest rate risk: Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in 
market interest rates. Interest rate risk primarily arises from investments in debt oriented mutual funds and debt securities. The Company's investments 
in debt oriented mutual funds and debt securities are primarily short-term, which do not expose it to significant interest rate risk. Additionally, since there 
are no external borrowings, The Company is not exposed to interest rate risk in with respect to borrowings.
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises
three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk and commodity risk. Financial instruments affected by market
risk include foreign currency receivables, deposits, investments in mutual funds. Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis. There has been
no change in the measurement and management of the Company's exposure to market risks.
The functional currency of The Company is INR. The Company does not have foreign currency exposure. Hence, currency risk is not there.
Price risk is the risk that the value of the financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices and related market variables including 
interest rate for investments in debt oriented mutual funds and debt securities, caused by factors specific to an individual investments, its issuer and 
market. The Company's exposure to price risk arises from diversified investments in mutual funds and Bonds, and Securities held for trade, and classified 
in the balance sheet at fair value through profit or loss.

financial assets. The Company's approach in managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities. In doing this, management 
considers both normal and stressed conditions. The Company also monitors the level of expected cash inflows on trade and other receivables together with

internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and 
completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of 
the Consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  
 
In preparing the Consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible 
for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to 
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.  
 
The respective Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Group’s 
financial reporting process. 
 
 
 
 
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 
 
Our objectives are to  obtain reasonable assurance about whether the  Consolidated 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.  
 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated financial 
statements. 
 
 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and 
maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
 
 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal control. 
 
 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for expressing 
our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal financial controls with 
reference to Consolidated Financial Statements in place and the operating 
effectiveness of such controls 
 
 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness 
of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis 
of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt 
on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material 
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the Consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures 
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or 
conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. 
 
 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the  Consolidated 
financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the  Consolidated 
financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner 
that achieves fair presentation. 
 
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Consolidated Financial Statements 
that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable user of the  Consolidated Financial Statements may be 
influenced. We consider quantitative materiality  and qualitative factors in (i) planning 
the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate 
the effect of any identified misstatements in the Consolidated Financial Statements . 
 
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any 
significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 
 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied 
with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with 
them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.  
 
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine 
those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Consolidated financial 
statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe 
these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public 
disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine 
that a matter should not be communicated i n our report because the adverse 
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication. 
 
Other Matters 
 
We did not audit the financial statements and other financial information, of a 
subsidiary company  whose financial statement is considered in the Consolidated 
Financial Statement. 
 
These financial statements of the subsidiary company have been audited by the other 
auditor whose reports have been furnished to us by the Holding Company ’s 
management and our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statement , in so far as it 
related to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of this subsidiary, and our 
report in terms of sub section (3) and (11) of Section 143 of the Act, in so far as it relates 
to the aforesaid subsidiary, is based solely on the report of such other auditors.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy 
of the internal financial control  system over financial reporting and their operating 
effectiveness. Our audit of in ternal financial controls over financial reporting included 
obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, 
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effective ness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The 
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements , whether due 
to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial 
controls system over financial reporting. 
 
 
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting 
A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting with 
reference to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the preparation of Consolidated 
Financial Statements  for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A Company’s internal financial control over financial reporting 
includes those policies and procedures that  
 
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;  
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit 
preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements   in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are 
being made only in accordance with authorization of Management and Directors of the 
Company; and  
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a 
material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 
 
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, 
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, 
material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over  financial reporting 
to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial 
reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree 
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

3.Summary of Material Accounting Policies:
3.1 Property, Plant and Equipment
Class of assets Useful Life (in years)
Building 60 Years
Office Equipment 5 Years
Furniture and Fixtures 5 to 10 Years
Computer Equipment 3 to 6 Years
Vehicles 8 to 10 Years
3.2 Impairment of non-financial assets
Depreciable amount for assets is the cost of an assets less its estimated residual value. Based on management’s
evaluation, useful life prescribed in Schedule II of the act represent actual useful life of Property, Plant and Equipment.
Accordingly, The Group has used useful lives as mentioned in Schedule II ofthe Act to provide depreciation of different
class of its Property, Plant and Equipment. The Group provides depreciation on reducing balance method as per the
useful life mentioned in Schedule II of the Act. Any change in estimate is accounted on prospective basis.
The estimated useful lives of Property, Plant and Equipment are as follows : 
Depreciation on additions is being provided on pro rata basis from the dateof such additions. Depreciation on assets
sold, discarded, disabled or demolished during the period is being provided up to the date in which such assets are sold,
discarded, disabled or demolished. 
Items of property, Plant and Equipment are stated at cost less accumulateddepreciation and accumulated impairment
losses, if any. Cost is inclusive of freight, duties, taxes or levies (net of recoverable taxes) and any directly attributable
cost of bringing the assets to their working condition for intended use. 
Property, plant and equipment which are not ready for intended use as on thedate o
f Balance Sheet are disclosed as
“Capital work-in-progress”. 
Items of Property, Plant and Equipment that have been retired from active use and are held for disposal are stated at
the lower of their net carrying amount and net realisable value and are shown separately in the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Any write-down in this regard is recognised immediately in the Consolidated statement of Profit and Loss.
At the end of each reporting period, The Group reviews the carrying amountsof non-financial assets, other than
deferred tax assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If
any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of such asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the
impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, The Group
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. Each CGU represents
the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets
or CGUs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to
individual CGUs, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of CGUs for which a reasonable and consistent
allocation basis can be identified. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fairvalue less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU for which the estimates of
future cash flows have not been adjusted.

cost of bringing the assets to their working condition for intended use. 
Property, plant and equipment which are not ready for intended use as on the date of Balance Sheet are disclosed as 
“Capital work-in-progress”. 
Items of Property, Plant and Equipment that have been retired from active use and are held for disposal are stated at 
the lower of their net carrying amount and net realisable value and are shown separately in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. Any write-down in this regard is recognised immediately in the Consolidated statement of Profit and Loss. 
Depreciable amount for assets is the cost of an assets less its estimated residual value. Based on management’s 
evaluation, useful life prescribed in Schedule II of the act represent actual useful life of Property, Plant and Equipment. 
Accordingly, The Group has used useful lives as mentioned in Schedule II of the Act to provide depreciation of different 
class of its Property, Plant and Equipment. The Group provides depreciation on reducing balance method as per the 
useful life mentioned in Schedule II of the Act. Any change in estimate is accounted on prospective basis. 
The estimated useful lives of Property, Plant and Equipment are as follows : 
Class of assets Useful Life (in years) 
Building 60 Years 
Office Equipment 5 Years 
Furniture and Fixtures 5 to 10 Years 
Computer Equipment 3 to 6 Years 
Vehicles 8 to 10 Years 
Depreciation on additions is being provided on pro rata basis from the date of such additions. Depreciation on assets 
sold, discarded, disabled or demolished during the period is being provided up to the date in which such assets are sold, 
discarded, disabled or demolished. 
3.2 Impairment of non-financial assets 
At the end of each reporting period, The Group reviews the carrying amounts of non-financial assets, other than 
deferred tax assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If 
any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of such asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, The Group 
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. Each CGU represents 
the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets 
or CGUs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to 
individual CGUs, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of CGUs for which a reasonable and consistent 
allocation basis can be identified. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU for which the estimates of 
future cash flows have not been adjusted.

3.3 Financial Instruments
(1) Initial Recognition and Measurements
(2) Classification and Subsequent Measurements
(a) Financial Assets
(i) At amortised cost
A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at
fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL):-
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial assetof one entity and a financial liability or equity
instrument of another entity. The financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet when The Group becomes a
party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. The Group determines the classification of its financial
instruments at initial recognition.
A financial asset and financial liability is initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable
to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities(other than financial assetsand financial liabilities at
fair value through profit and loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial
liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costsdirectly attributable to the acquisition of financial
assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss are recognised immediately in the Consolidated
statement of Profit and Loss.
Where the fair value of a financial asset or financial liability at initialrecognition is different from its transaction price,
the difference between the fair value and the transaction price is recognized as a gain or loss in the Consolidated
statement of Profit and Loss at initial recognition if the fair value is determined through a quoted market price in an
active market for an identical asset (i.e. level 1 input) or through a valuation technique that uses data from observable
markets (i.e. level 2 input).
In case the fair value is not determined using a level 1 or level 2 input as mentioned above, the difference between the
fair value and transaction price is deferred appropriately and recognized as a gain or loss in the Consolidated statement
of Profit and Loss only to the extent that such gain or loss arises due to a change in factor that market participants take
into account when pricing the financial assets or financial liability.
Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at transaction price.
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classifiedbased on assessment of business model in
which they are held. This assessment is done for portfolio of the financial assets. The relevant categories are as below:
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU ) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of
the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment lossis recognised immediately in the
Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss. Impairment loss recognised in respect of a CGU is allocated to reduce the
carrying amounts of the other assets of the CGU (or group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis. 
Reversal of impairment losses recognised in earlier years is recorded when there is an indication that the impairment
losses recognised for the asset/cashgenerating unit no longer exist or have decreased. However, the increase in
carrying amount of an asset due to reversal of an impairment loss is recognised to the extent it does not exceed the
carrying amount that would have been determined (net of depreciation) hadno impairment loss been recognised for
that asset/cash generating unit in earlier years. Reversal of impairmentloss is directly recognised in the Consolidated
statement of Profit and Loss.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU ) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of 
the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the 
Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss. Impairment loss recognised in respect of a CGU is allocated to reduce the 
carrying amounts of the other assets of the CGU (or group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis. 
Reversal of impairment losses recognised in earlier years is recorded when there is an indication that the impairment 
losses recognised for the asset/cash generating unit no longer exist or have decreased. However, the increase in 
carrying amount of an asset due to reversal of an impairment loss is recognised to the extent it does not exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined (net of depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for

statement of Profit and Loss. 
3.3 Financial Instruments 
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity 
instrument of another entity. The financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet when The Group becomes a 
party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. The Group determines the classification of its financial 
instruments at initial recognition. 
(1) Initial Recognition and Measurements 
A financial asset and financial liability is initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable 
to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at 
fair value through profit and loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial 
liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial 
assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss are recognised immediately in the Consolidated 
statement of Profit and Loss. 
Where the fair value of a financial asset or financial liability at initial recognition is different from its transaction price, 
the difference between the fair value and the transaction price is recognized as a gain or loss in the Consolidated 
statement of Profit and Loss at initial recognition if the fair value is determined through a quoted market price in an 
active market for an identical asset (i.e. level 1 input) or through a valuation technique that uses data from observable 
markets (i.e. level 2 input). 
In case the fair value is not determined using a level 1 or level 2 input as mentioned above, the difference between the 
fair value and transaction price is deferred appropriately and recognized as a gain or loss in the Consolidated statement 
of Profit and Loss only to the extent that such gain or loss arises due to a change in factor that market participants take 
into account when pricing the financial assets or financial liability. 
Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at transaction price. 
(2) Classification and Subsequent Measurements

For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified based on assessment of business model in 
which they are held. This assessment is done for portfolio of the financial assets. The relevant categories are as below:

(ii) At fair value through Other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
(iii) At fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL)
(iv) Investment in Equity Instruments
(v) Impairment of Financial assets
Where The Group classifies equity instruments as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding
dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts of profit or loss from OCI to Consolidated
statement of Profit and Loss, even on sale of investment. 
The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its assets carried at amortised
cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since
initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased significantly, twelve month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss,
otherwise lifetime ECL is used. 
However, only in case of trade receivables, The Group applies the simplified approach which requires expected lifetime
losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. 
Expected credit losses rate the weight e da v e r a g eo fc r e d i tl o s s e sw i t ht h erespective risks of default occurring as the
weights. Credit loss is the difference between all contractual cash flowsthat are due to The Group in accordance with
the contract and all the cash flows that The Group expects to receive (i.e. all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original
effective interest rate. The Group estimates cash flows by considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument
through the expected life of that financial instrument. 
Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount o
f the
assets.
Financial assets which are not measured at amortised cost or OCI and are held for trading are measured at FVTPL. Fair
value changes related to such financial assets are recognised in the Consolidated statement of Profit and Loss.
Based on The Group’s business model, The Group has classified its securities held for trade,Investment in Equity Shares
and Investment in Mutual Funds at FVTPL.
Investment in Subsidiaries, Associates and Joint ventures are out of scope of Ind AS 109 and hence, The Group has
accounted for its investment in Subsidiaries at cost.
All other equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109, are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for
trading are classified as at FVTPL. For equity instruments other than heldfor trading, The Group has irrevocable option
to present in Other Comprehensive Income subsequent changes in the fair value. The Group makes such election on an
instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable. 
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified datesto cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
A financial asset is measured at FVTOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL: 
• the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and
selling financial assets; and 
• the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified datesto cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

(iii) Derecognition of Financial Liabilities
(iv) Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, The Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or
have expired. An exchange with a lender of debt instruments with substantially different terms is accounted for as an
extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.Similarly, a substantial
modification of the terms of an existing financial liability is accountedfor as an extinguishment of the original financial
liability and the recognition of a newfinancial liability. The differenceb e t w e e nt h ec a r r y i n ga m o u n to ft h ef i n a n c i a l
liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in the Consolidated statement of Profit and
Loss.
Trade and other payables are recognised at the transaction cost, which is its fair value, and subsequently measured at
amortised cost.
• such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would
otherwise arise;
A financial liability may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if: 
• the financial liability whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with The Group’s
documented risk management.
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire,
or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and
rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which TheGroup neither transfers nor retains
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control of the financial asset. 
On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of
the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or lossthat had been recognised in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity is recognised in the Consolidated statement of Profit and Loss if such
gain or loss would have otherwise beenrecognised in the Consolidated statement of Profit and Loss on disposal of that
financial asset.
Fair value changes related to such financial liabilities are recognised in the Consolidated statement of Profit and Loss.
All financial liabilities of The Group are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method or
at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities that are not held-for-trading and are not designated as at FVTPL are measured at amortised cost at
the end of subsequent accounting periods. The carrying amounts of financial liabilities that are subsequently measured
at amortised cost are determined based on the effective interest method. Under the effective interest method, the
future cash payments are exactly discounted to the initial recognition value using the effective interest rate. The
cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of the difference between the initial recognition amount
and the maturity amount is added to the initial recognition value (net of principal repayments, if any) of the financial
liability over the relevant period ofthe financial liability to arrive atthe amortized cost at each reporting date. The
corresponding effect of the amortization under effective interest method is recognized as interest expense over the
relevant period of the financial liability. The same is included under finance cost in the Consolidated statement of Profit
and Loss.

(i) At amortised cost: 
Financial liabilities that are not held-for-trading and are not designated as at FVTPL are measured at amortised cost at 
the end of subsequent accounting periods. The carrying amounts of financial liabilities that are subsequently measured 
at amortised cost are determined based on the effective interest method. Under the effective interest method, the 
future cash payments are exactly discounted to the initial recognition value using the effective interest rate. The 
cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of the difference between the initial recognition amount 
and the maturity amount is added to the initial recognition value (net of principal repayments, if any) of the financial 
liability over the relevant period of the financial liability to arrive at the amortized cost at each reporting date. The 
corresponding effect of the amortization under effective interest method is recognized as interest expense over the 
relevant period of the financial liability. The same is included under finance cost in the Consolidated statement of Profit 
and Loss. 
Trade and other payables are recognised at the transaction cost, which is its fair value, and subsequently measured at 
amortised cost. 
(ii) At Fair Value through Profit and Loss: 
A financial liability may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if:

(ii) Defined Contribution Plan 
(iii) Defined Benefit Plan 
(d) In respect of other heads of income, it is accounted for to the extent it is probable that the economic benefits will
flow, and the revenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. An entity shall
recognise a refund liability if the entity receives consideration from a customer and expects to refund some or all of
that consideration to the customer.
Dividend Income: Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment o
f the dividend is established, it is
probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to The Group and the amount of the
dividend can be measured reliably.
Employee benefits include short term employee benefits, provident fund, employee’s state insurance, and gratuity 
All employee benefits payable whollywithin twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short term
employee benefits and they are recognized in the period in which the employee renders the related service. The Group
recognizes the undiscounted amount of short term employee benefits expect e dt ob ep a i di ne x c h a n g ef o rs e r v i c e s
rendered as a liability (accrued expense) after deducting any amount already paid. 
The Group’s contribution to Provident Fund, Employee State Insurance Scheme are considered as defined contribution
plans and are charged as an expense based on the amount of contribution required to be made and when services are
rendered by the employees. The Group does not carry any further obligations, apart from the contributions made on a
monthly basis. 
The Group provides for the gratuity, a defined benefit plan (the “”Gratuity Plan””) covering eligible employees in
accordance with the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump sum payment to vested
employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective
employee’s salary and the tenure of employment. The Group’s liability is actuarially determined (using the Projected
Unit Credit method) at the end of each year. The Group's liability is un-funded. Re-measurements of the net defined
benefit liability comprising actuarial gains and losses (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined
benefit liability) and, are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income. Such re-measurements are not reclassified to the
Consolidated statement of Profit and Loss in the subsequent year.
Commission and Fees Income relating to Stock Broking :Revenue from contract with customer is recognised point in
time when performance obligation is satisfied. Income from broking activities is accounted for on the trade date of
transactions.

employee’s salary and the tenure of employment. The Group’s liability is actuarially determined (using the Projected 
Unit Credit method) at the end of each year. The Group's liability is un-funded. Re-measurements of the net defined 
benefit liability comprising actuarial gains and losses (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined 
benefit liability) and, are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income. Such re-measurements are not reclassified to the

(i) Current tax :
(ii) Deferred tax :
3.7 Provisions, Contingent liabilities and Contingent Asset:
3.8 Leases
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
Deferred tax is recognised for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying values of
assets and liabilities in ConsolidatedFinancial Statements and their respective tax bases at the reporting date, using the
tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantially enacted as on reporting date. The measurement of deferred tax
reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which The Group expects, at the reporting date, to
recover or settle the carrying amount ofits assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is also recognised in respect of carried
forward tax losses and tax credits subject to the assessment of reasonablecertainty of recovery. Deferred tax assets
and deferred tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off assets against liabilities
representing current tax and where the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to taxes on income
levied by the same governing taxation laws. Deferred tax relating to itemsrecognised outside the Consolidated
statement of Profit and Loss is recognised outside with the underlying items i.e. either in the statement of other
comprehensive income or directly in equity as relevant.
Provisions are recognised when The Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it
is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits willbe required to settle the obligation and a
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best
estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into
account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected
future cash flows (representing the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the
balance sheet date) at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the liability.When The Group expects some or all of a provisionto be reimbursed, for example, under an
insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset,but only when the reimbursement is virtually
certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the Consolidated statement of Profit and Loss net of any
reimbursement. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost. Expected future operating losses are not
provided for. Contingent liabilities are not recognised but are disclosed in the notes. Contingent assets are not
recognised but are disclosed in the notes where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases that have a
lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not containa purchase option). It also applies
the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-term
leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the reporting period in
accordance with the Income-tax Act,1961 enacted in India and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in
respect of previous years. The amount of current tax reflects the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid
or received after considering the uncertainty, if any, related to income taxes. It is measured using tax rates (and tax
laws) enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date. Current taxassets and current tax liabilities are offset only
if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts, and it is intended to realise the asset and settle
the liability on a net basis or simultaneously. 
Tax on Income comprises current and deferred tax.

4.1  Business Model Assessment: 
4.2  Fair Value Of Financial Instrument: 
Classification and measurement of financial assets depends on the results of the SPPI (Solely Payments of Principal and
Interest) and the business model test. The Group determines the business model at a level that reflects how groups of
financial assets are managed together to achieve a particular business objective. This assessment includes judgement
reflecting all relevant evidence including how the performance of the assets is evaluated and their performance
measured, the risks that affect the performance of the assets and how these are managed.
The Group monitors financial assets measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income
that are derecognised prior to their maturity to understand the reason fortheir disposal and whether the reasons are
consistent with the objective of the business for which the asset was held.Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL),
where the assets are managed in accordance with an approved investment strategy that triggers purchase and sale
decisions based on the fair value of such assets. Such assets are subsequently measured at fair value, with unrealised
gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value being recognised inthe statement of profit and loss in the period
in which they arise.
Level 2:inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable forthe asset or liability, either directly
or indirectly; and
Level 3:inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) that the
Group can access at measurement date.
The fair value of financial instruments is the price that would be receivedto sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
an orderly transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under current market
conditions (i.e., an exit price) regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another
valuation technique. When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet
cannot be derived from active markets, they are determined using a varietyof valuation techniques that include the
use of valuation models. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this
is not feasible, estimation is required in establishing fair values. Judgements and estimates include considerations of
liquidity and model inputs related to items such as credit risk (both own and counterparty), funding value adjustments,
correlation and volatility.
Some of the group's assets and liabilities are measured at fair value for financial reporting purposes. Fair value is the
price that would be received to sell anasset or paid to transfer a liabilityin an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another 
valuation technique.
Fair value measurements under Ind AS are categorised into Level 1, 2, or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to
the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its
entirety, which are described as follows:
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access at
measurement date

The significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligation are the discount rate, the salary growth rate and the average life
expectancy. The assumptions used for the valuation of the defined benefit obligation are as follows:
Estimates of future salary increase takes into account: inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors, such as supply and demand in the
employment market The plan exposes the Group to significant actuarial risks such as interest rate risk and inflation risk: 
Inflation risk - A significant proportion of the defined benefit liability is linked to inflation. An increase in the inflation rate will increase the Group's liability. 
Interest rate risk-The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated using a discount rate prevailing market yields of Indian government securities.
A decrease in discount rate will increase the Group's defined benefit liability.

Sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in Defined Benefit Obligation in isolation and assuming there are no other changes in market
conditions at the accounting date. In presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligations has been calculated using
the Projected Unit Credit Method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability
recognised in the balance sheet. This analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change
in the assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
(viii) The weighted average duration of the benefit obligation as at March 31, 2025 is 16 years. (as at March 31, 2024 is 16 years)

Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in the Balance Sheet are grouped into three levels of a fair valuehierarchy, The three levels are
defined based on the observability of significant inputs to the measurement, as follows:
Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly.
Level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The Group's cash and bank balances, trade receivables, investments, securities held for trade, loans, and security deposits. The carrying amounts of financial
assets represent the maximum credit risk exposure. Credit risk assessment on various components is described below: 
(i) Trade receivables The Group's trade receivables primarily include receivables from asset management companies (AMCs) for services provided, 
receivable from stock exchanges (for trade executed on behalf of customers) as well as clients and receivable from insurance companies. The group has 
not made any provision on ECL on account of receivables from AMCs, Stock exchanges and Insurance companies. The group's management as establised 
accounts receivable policy under which customer accounts are regularly monitored. The group has a dedicated risk management team, which monitors 
the positions, exposures and margins on a continuous basis.
(ii) Cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits, investments and Securities held for trade The Group maintains its cash and cash equivalents, bank 
deposits, investment, and securities held for trade with reputed banks, financial institutions, and corporates. The credit risk on these instruments is 
limited because the counterparties are banks and high credit rated financial institutions and corporates assigned by credit rating agencies.
(iii) Security Deposits and Loans This consists of loans given to Employees and Security Deposits given to lessors as well as to utility providers like 
Electricity companies. These carries limited credit risk based on the financial position of parties and Group's historical experience of dealing with these 
parties.
(iv) Expected Credit Loss (ECL): The Group follows simplified ECL method in case of Trade Receivables and The Group recognises lifetime expected losses 
for all trade receivables that do not constitute a financing transaction. The Group assesses the provision for ECL on each reporting dates. For the purpose 
of computation of ECL, the term default implies an event where amount due towards margin requirement and/or mark to market losses for which the 
client was unable to provide funds/collaterals, within 90 days of its due, to bridge the shortfall, the same is termed as margin call triggered. The Group 
assesses allowance for expected credit losses for Loans and other financial assets. The ECL allowance is based upon 12 months expected credit losses. 
These carries very minimal credit risk based on the financial position of parties and Company's historical experience of dealing with these parties. Credit 
Risk on Other Financial assets is considered insignificant considering the nature of such assets and absence of counterparty risk.
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises
three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk and commodity risk. Financial instruments affected by market
risk include foreign currency receivables, deposits, investments in mutual funds. Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis. There has been
no change in the measurement and management of the Group's exposure to market risks.
The functional currency of The Group is INR. The Group does not have foreign currency exposure. Hence, currency risk is not there.
