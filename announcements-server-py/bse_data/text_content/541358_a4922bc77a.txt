Independent Auditor’s Review Report on the Quarterly and year to date Unaudited Financial Results of the Company 
Pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 as amended. 
Review Report to 
The Board of Directors 
Unifinz Capital India Limited 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results of Unifinz Capital India Limited for the 
quarter ended 30th September, 2025 and year to date from April 01,2025 to September 30,2025 (“the Statement") attached 
herewith, being submitted by the company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SI:BI (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (“the listing regulations”). 
2. The Company's Management is responsible for the preparation of the statement in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standards 34, (Ind AS 34) “Interim Financial Reporting" prescribed 
under Section 133 of the companies Act, 2013 as amended, read with relevant rules issued there under and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India read with the Circular. The Statement has been approved by the company’s Board of 
Directors. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the statement based on our view. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410, "Review of 
Interim Financial [nformation Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether 
the Statement is free of material misstatement. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, 
primarily of persons respénsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A 
review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does 
not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. 
Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying 
Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian 
Accounting Standards ('Ind AS') specified under Section 133 of the Companics Act, 2013 as amended, read with relevant rules 
issued there under and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to 
be disclosed in terms of the Listing Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any 
‘material misstatement. 
Other Matter 
We did not review / audit the financial results / information of company for the quarter ended June 30,2025, September 30,2024, 
Period ended September 30,2024 & Year ended March 31, 2025 which have been reviewed / audited by other auditor, whose report 
has been furnished to us, our conclusion in so far as it relates to the amounts included in respect of above is based solely on the 
report of another auditor. 
Our opinion is not modified in respect of above matter.
