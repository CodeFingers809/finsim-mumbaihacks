Jaipur, November 14, 2025  – Insolation Energy Limited (BSE:  543620), India’s leading solar 
manufacturer of high -efficiency solar PV modules , announced financial results for the half year 
ended September 30, 2025.  
 
Commenting on the performance  Mr. Manish Gupta, Chairman of Insolation Energy, said , “I am 
pleased to report that we delivered a strong performance in H1 FY26. This performance highlights 
the strengths of our business model and  focused execution approach.  Despite industry wide 
challenges arising from an extended monsoon period, we continued to deliver robust growth 
supported by strong demand across all our customer segments.    
The already commissioned new 3 GW solar module plant and the upcoming commissioning of 1.5 
GW by Q3FY26 end will position us strongly for the second half of the year, allowing us to fully serve 
our customer needs. Talking about our long term strategy, we have already started construction 
work on our 4.5 GW solar cell manufacturing plant  and 18,000 MTPA aluminium frame 
manufacturing and expect to commercialise it by H2FY27. This marks a significant milestone in 
deepening vertical integration and reinforcing India’s domestic value chain in line with national 
renewable-energy priorities. 
With a differentiated business model of vertical integration, a focused leadership team, and a clear 
roadmap for scale, Insolation remains committed in its mission to deliver reliable, affordable solar 
solutions and accelerate India’s transition to a sustainable energy future.” 
 
In addition, Mr. Vikas Jain, Managing Director of Insolation Energy said “Our consolidated revenues 
rose 25.6% to Rs. 776.7 crore, driven by healthy growth underpinning greater acceptance of our 
solar module products. We saw benefits of scale accruing to our EBITDA resulting in margin increase 
of 60 bps to 14.7%. 
We commenced commercial production at our INA 3 plant, which is amongst India’s most advanced, 
fully automated TOPCon N-type module manufacturing plants. This plant follows stringent testing 
norms and low defect rate acceptability resulting in high quality output. We have already 
commenced production on two lines  amounting to 3 GW and expect to start Line 3 production  for 
an additional 1.5 GW by Q3FY26 end. 
We continue to see increased acceptance of our products resulting in greater scale. We expect to 
see this traction in all our segments to continue, making us confident that we will deliver greater 
shareholder returns in the medium to long term.”
