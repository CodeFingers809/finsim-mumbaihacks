DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS 
A. MODE OF DISPATCH OF THE FIRST AND FINAL CALL NOTICE: 
 
In terms of the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”), read with the relevant rules made 
thereunder, the First and Final Call Money Notice is being sent electronically to Eligible Shareholders 
whose e -mail IDs are registered with the Company, its Registrar and Transfer Agent , or Depository

BSE website https://www.bseindia.com/publicissue.html 
 
B. PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS 
 
Please note that: 
 
a. Cash payment shall not be accepted. 
 
b. No part payment would be accepted, and part payment would be treated as non -payment which shall 
render the partly paid-up equity share(s), including the amount already paid thereon, liable to be forfeited 
in accordance with the provisions of the Act, the Articles of Association of the Company, and the Letter 
of Offer dated June 19, 2025 (“Letter of Offer”). However, in relation to any payment made by a holder 
of the partly paid -up equity share(s) pursuant to the First and Final Call, which is lesser than th e 
aggregate amount payable by such holder with respect to the partly paid-up equity share(s) held by such 
holder as on the First and Final Call Record Date, the Board may consider conversion of such lower 
number of Equity Shares to be made fully paid -up, such that it is in proportion to the amount paid by 
such holder. 
 
For example - If a shareholder holds 10 partly paid -up equity shares as on the First and Final Call 
Record Date, the aggregate amount payable by such holder pursuant to the First and Final Call Money 

will be ₹ 50/-. If such holder makes a partial payment of ₹ 25/-, such holder will receive such number of 
fully paid-up Equity Shares converted in proportion to the payment made i.e., 5 partly paid -up Equity 
Shares. Partly paid-up equity shares in respect of which the First and Final Call Money payable remains 
unpaid may be forfeited, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, the Articles of Association of the 
Company and the Letter of Offer. 
 
c. The Company and the RTA are entitled to rely on the self-certification of the transaction by the Eligible 
Shareholder. Payments made using third party bank accounts will be rejected. 
 
d. Shareholders shall ensure that the partly paid-up shares are held in the demat account which is mentioned 
on the ASBA bid. If the RTA finds during validations that the partly paid shares is held under a different 
demat account then such request for conversion to fully paid will not be accepted and the payment made 
will be returned. If the shareholder misses the opportunity to convert the shares into fully paid on account 
of this reason, neither the RTA nor the company can be held responsible for the same. 
 
e. Excess/duplicate amount paid, or amount paid by person who is not an Eligible Shareholder as on the 
First and Final Call Re cord Date or short payment made by an Eligible Shareholder (in case the same 
cannot be adjusted towards payment of First and Final Call Money), will be refunded to the same bank
