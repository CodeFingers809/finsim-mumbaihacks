Fair Enterprise Valuation of SPVs

I understand from the Investment Manager that Net Debt to AUM of Capital Infra Trust as at 30th June 2025 was 
54.97%. In this regard, the Investment Manager and the Trustee intends to undertake the fair enterprise valuation 
of the SPVs as on 30th September 2025 (“Valuation Date”) for incorporating any key changes from the period 
ended 30th June 2025 till 30th September 2025. 
I am enclosing the Report providing opinion on the fair enterprise value of the SPVs on a going concern basis as 
at 30th September 2025 (“Valuation Date”). 
Enterprise Value (“EV”) is described as the total value of the equity in a business plus the value of its debt and debt 
related liabilities, minus any Cash and Cash Equivalents to meet those liabilities. The attached Report details the 
valuation methodologies used, calculations performed and the conclusion reached with respect to this valuation. 
I was further requested by the Investment Manager to provide the adjusted enterprise value of the SPVs as at 30th 
September 2025, where the adjusted enterprise value (“ Adjusted EV”) is derived as EV as defined above plus 
Cash and Cash Equivalents of the SPVs as at 30th September 2025. 
I have relied on explanations and information provided by the Investment Manager. Although, I have reviewed such 
data for consistency, those are not independently investigated or otherwise verified. My team and I have no present 
or planned future interest in the Trust, the SPVs or the Investment Manager except to the extent of this appointment 
as an independent valuer and the fee for this Valuation Report (“Report”) which is not contingent upon the values 
reported herein. The valuation analysis should not be construed as investment advice, specifically, I do not express 
any opinion on the suitability or otherwise of entering into any financial or other transaction with the Trust.    
The analysis must be considered as a whole. Selecting portions of any analysis or the factors that are considered 
in this Report, without considering all factors and analysis together could create a misleading view of the process 
underlying the valuation c onclusions. The preparation of a valuation is a complex process and is not necessarily 
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Any attempt to do so could lead to undue emphasis on any 
particular factor or analysis. 
The information provided to me by the Investment Manager in relation to the SPV s included but not limited to 
historical financial statements, forecasts/projections, other statements and assumptions about future matters like 
forward-looking financial information prepared by the Investment Manager. The forecasts and projections as 
supplied to me are based upon assumptions about events and circumstances which are yet to occur.  
By nature, valuation is based on estimates and it includes the risks and uncertainties relating to the events occurring 
in the future. Accordingly, the actual figures in future may differ from these estimates and may have a significant 
impact on the valuation of the SPVs. 
I have not tested individual assumptions or attempted to substantiate the veracity or integrity of such assumptions 
in relation to the forward -looking financial information, however, I have made sufficient enquiry to satisfy myself 
that such information has been prepared on a reasonable basis.  
Notwithstanding anything above, I cannot provide any assurance that the forward-looking financial information will 
be representative of the results which will actually be achieved during the cash flow forecast period.  
The valuation provided by me and the valuation conclusion are included herein and the Report complies with the 
SEBI InvIT Regulations and guidelines, circular or notification issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of 
India (“SEBI”) thereunder as amended from time-to-time. 
Please note that all comments in the Report must be read in conjunction with the caveats to the Report, which are 
contained in Section 11 of this Report. This letter, the Report and the summary of valuation included herein can be 
provided to Trust’s advisors and may be made available for the inspection to the public and with the SEBI, the 
stock exchanges and any other regulatory and supervisory authority, as may be required. 
I draw your attention to the limitation of liability clauses in Section 11 of this Report.  
This letter should be read in conjunction with the attached Report. 
Yours faithfully,

1.5. Purpose of Valuation 
(i) As per Regulation 21(5) of Chapter V of the SEBI InvIT Regulations: 
        "A half yearly valuation of the assets of the InvIT  shall be conducted by the valuer for the half -year ending 
September 30th for a publicly offered InvIT for incorporating any key changes in the previous six months and 
such half yearly valuation report shall be submitted by the Investment Manager to the designated stock 
exchanges(s) along with the quarterly financial results for quarter ending 30th September. 
        If the consolidated borrowings and deferred payments of an InvIT, in terms of regulation 20 of these 
regulations, exceeds forty nine per cent. ; a quarterly valuation of the assets of InvIT shall be conducted by 
the valuer as at the end of the quarters ending June, September and December for incorporating any key 
changes from the previous quarter and such quarterly valuation report shall be submitted by the investment 
manager to the designated stock exchange(s) along with the quarterly financial resu lts of the corresponding 
quarter. ” 
        In this regard, the Investment Manager has appointed me, S. Sundararaman (“Registered Valuer” or “RV” or 
“I” or “My” or “Me”) bearing IBBI registration number IBBI/RV/06/2018/10238 to undertake fair valuation of the 
SPVs at the enterprise level as per the extant provisions of the SEBI InvIT Regulations issued by SEBI.  
Enterprise Value (“EV”) is described as the total value of the equity in a business plus the value of its debt 
and debt related liabilities, minus any Cash and Cash Equivalents to meet those liabilities. 
(ii) Further, on the request of the Investment Manager, I have calculated Adjusted Enterprise Value of the SPVs 
which is derived as the EV as defined above plus Cash and Cash Equivalents of the SPVs as at the Valuation 
Date. 
(iii) I declare that: 
a) I am competent to undertake the financial valuation in terms of the SEBI InvIT Regulations; 
b) I am not an associate of the Sponsor(s) or Investment Manager or Trustee and I have not less than 
five years of experience in valuation of infrastructure assets; 
c) I am independent and have prepared the Report on a fair and unbiased basis; 
d) I have valued the SPVs based on the valuation standards as specified  / applicable as per SEBI InvIT 
Regulations.  
This Report covers all the disclosures required as per the SEBI InvIT Regulations and the Valuation of the 
SPVs is impartial, true and fair and in compliance with the SEBI InvIT Regulations. 
(Please refer appendix 7 for further information about myself) 
 
1.6. Scope of Valuation 
(i) Financial Asset to be Valued 
The RV has been mandated by the Investment Manager to arrive at the Enterprise Value (“EV”) of the SPVs. 
Enterprise Value is described as the total value of the equity in a business plus the value of its debt and debt 
related liabilities, minus any Cash and Cash Equivalents to meet those liabilities. 
Further, at the request of the Investment Manager, I have calculated Adjusted Enterprise Value of the SPVs 
which is derived as the EV as defined above plus Cash and Cash Equivalents of the SPVs as at the valuation 
date. 
(ii) Valuation Base 
Valuation Base means the indication of the type of value being used in an engagement. In the present case, 
I have determined the fair value of the SPVs at the enterprise level. Fair Value Bases defined as under: 
Fair Value 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the valuation date. It is the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market at 
the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e. an exit price) regardless of whether  that price is 
directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. Fa ir value or Market value is usually 
synonymous to each other except in certain circumstances where characteristics of an asset translate into a 
special asset value for the party(ies) involved.

(iii) Valuation Date 
Valuation Date is the specific date at which the value of the assets to be valued gets estimated or measured. 
Valuation is time specific and can change with the passage of time due to changes in the condition of the 
asset to be valued. Accordingly , valuation of an asset as at a particular date can be different from other 
date(s). 
The Valuation Date considered for the fair enterprise valuation of the SPVs  is 30th September 2025 
(“Valuation Date”). The attached Report is drawn up by reference to accounting and financial information as 
on 30th September 2025. The RV is not aware of any other events having occurred since 30th September 
2025 till date of this Report (“Report Date”) which he deems to be significant for his valuation analysis. 
(iv) Premise of Value 
Premise of Value refers to the conditions and circumstances how an asset is deployed. In the present case, 
RV has determined the fair enterprise value of the SPVs on a Going Concern Value defined as under: 
(V)        Going Concern Value 
Going Concern value is the value of a business enterprise that is expected to continue to operate in the future. 
The intangible elements of going concern value result from factors such as having a trained work force, an 
operational plant, necessary licenses, systems, and procedures in place etc.

1.7. Summary of Valuation 
I have assessed the fair enterprise value of each of the SPVs on a stand-alone basis by using the Discounted 
Cash Flow (“DCF”) method under the income approach. Following table summarizes my explaination on the 
usage or non usage of different valuation methods:  
Valuation 
Approach 
Valuation 
Methodology Used Explanation 
Cost Approach Net Asset 
Value No 
NAV does not capture the future earning potential of the 
business. Hence NAV method is considered only for 
background reference. 
Income 
Approach 
Discounted 
Cash Flow Yes 
The revenue of all the SPVs is mainly derived from the 
annuity fees that are typically pre -determined with the 
relevant government authority and cannot be modified to 
reflect prevailing circumstances, other than annual 
adjustments to account for inflation and interest rate 
changes as applicable, as specified in the concession 
agreements. Accordingly, since all the SPVs are generating 
income based on pre-determined agreements / mechanism 
and since the Investment Manager has provided me the 
financial projections for the balance tenor of the concession 
agreements, DCF Method under the income approach has 
been considered as the appropriate method for the present 
valuation exercise. 
Market 
Approach  
Market Price No 
The equity shares of the SPVs are not listed on any 
recognized stock exchange in India. Hence, I was unable to 
apply the market price method.  
Comparable 
Companies No 
In the absence of any exactly comparable listed companies 
with characteristics and parameters similar to that of the 
SPVs, I am unable to consider this method for the current 
valuation. 
Comparable 
Transactions No In the absence of adequate details about the Comparable 
Transactions, I was unable to apply the CTM method. 
 
Under the DCF Method, the Free Cash Flow to Firm (“FCFF”) has been used for the purpose of valuation of 
each of the SPVs. In order to arrive at the fair EV of the individual SPVs under the DCF Method, I have relied 
on Provisional Financial Statements as at 30th September 2025 prepared in accordance with the Indian 
Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and the financial projections of the respective SPVs prepared by the 
Investment Manager as at the Valuation Date based on their best judgement.  
The discount rate considered for the respective SPVs for the purpose of this valuation exercise is based on 
the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (“WACC”) for each of the SPVs. As all the SPVs under considerations 
have executed projects under the HAM model, the operating rights of the underlying assets shall be 
transferred back to the appointing authority after the expiry of the concession period. At the end of the agreed 
concession period, the operating rights in relation to the roads and the obligation to maintain the road revert 
to the government entity that grant ed the concession by the SPVs. Accordingly, terminal period value i.e. 
value on account of cash flows to be generated after the expiry of concession period has not been considered.

* Enterprise Value (“EV”) is described as the total value of the equity in a business plus the value of its debt and debt related 
liabilities, minus any Cash and Cash Equivalents to meet those liabilities.  
** Further, on the request of the Investment Manager, I have calculated Adjusted Enterprise Value of the SPVs which is 
derived as the EV as defined above plus Cash and Cash equivalents of the SPVs as at the Valuation Date. 
(Refer Appendix 1 & 2 for the detailed workings) 
The fair EV of the SPVs is estimated using DCF method. The valuation requires the Investment Manager to 
make certain assumptions about the model inputs including forecast cash flows, discount rate, and credit risk. 
Further to above , considering that present valuation exercise is based on the future financial performance 
and based on opinions on the future credit risk, cost of debt assumptions, etc., which represent reasonable 
expectations at a particular point of time, but such information, estimates or opinions are not offered as 
predictions or as assurances that a particular level of income or profit will be achieved, a particular event will 
occur or that a particular level of income or profit will be achieved, a particular event wi ll occur or that a 
particular price will be offered or accepted. Actual results achieved during the period covered by the 
prospective financial analysis will vary from these estimates and variations may be material. Accordingly, a 
quantitative sensitivity analysis is considered on the following unobservable inputs: 
 
a. WACC by increasing / decreasing it by 0.25% (performed at the request of management) 
b. WACC by increasing / decreasing it by 0.5% 
c. WACC by increasing / decreasing it by 1.0% 
d. Bank Rate by increasing / decreasing it by 0.25% (performed at the request of management) 
e. Total Expenses by increasing / decreasing it by 20%

5. Overview of the Industry 
5.1 Introduction of Indian Infrastructure Industry  
As India strives towards becoming a developed economy, the transport sector plays a crucial role. In the 2025-
26 Budget, the capital expenditure allocation is set at Rs 11.21 lakh crore. 
During the Financial Year 2024 –25, the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) constructed 5,614 km of 
National Highways, exceeding its target of 5,150 km. Capital expenditure for highway development reached a 
record ₹2,50,000 crore, surpassing the targ et of ₹2,40,000 crore. This included both government budgetary 
support and NHAI’s own funds. Compared to previous years, this marked a 21% increase from ₹2,07,000 
crore in FY 2023–24 and a 45% rise from ₹1,73,000 crore in FY 2022–23. Rs 1.5 lakh crore have been outlaid 
for 50-year interest free loans to states for capital expenditure and incentives for reforms. 
The second asset monetization plan for 2025 -30 is to be launched for generating capital of Rs 10 lakh crore 
for new projects.  
5.2 Road Network in India 
5.2.1 As of December 2024, India is the second-largest road network in the world, with National Highways extending 
over 146,195 km and serving as the country’s primary arterial routes. To further strengthen and expand this 
network, the Government has launched several major initiatives, including the Bharatmala Pariyojana (along 
with NHDP), the Special Accelerated Road Development Programme for the Northeastern Region (SARDP-
NE), the Left Wing Extremism (LWE) road development projects such as the Vijayawada -Ranchi Road, and 
Externally Aided Projects (EAP). 
Over 64.5% of all goods in the country are transported through roads, while 90% of the total passenger traffic 
uses road network to commute.

5.2.2 NHs constitute around 2 per cent of the total road network in the country but carry about 40% of the road 
traffic. The density of India’s highway network at 1.89 km of roads per square kilometer of land – is similar to 
that of the France (1.98) and much greater than China’s (0.49) or USA’s (0.68). 
5.2.3 National Highway (NH) network increased by ~60% from 91,287 km in 2014 to 1,46,145 km in year 2024.

5.3 Government Agencies for Road Development 
5.3.1 The Ministry of Road Transport & Highway (“MoRTH”) is responsible for development of Road Transport and 
Highways in general and construction & maintenance of National Highways. 
5.3.2 The National Highways Authority of India (“NHAI”) is an autonomous agency of the Government of India, set 
up in 1988 and is responsible for implementation of National Highways Development Project (“NHDP”).  
5.3.3 In 2025, the Indian government, through the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), is focusing 
on constructing 10,000 km of national highways, including 5,800 km of high-speed corridors, and developing 
700+ wayside amenities (WSAs) along national  highways and expressways. A significant allocation of Rs 
1,16,292 crore has been made towards roads and bridges in the 2025-26 financial year. 
5.3.4 The NHDP in the context of NHs is nearing completion - in seven phases. Later, the other highway 
development programmes like Special Accelerated Road Development Programme for Development of Road 
Network in Northeastern States (SARDP- NE) and National Highways Interconnectivity Improvement Project 
(NHIIP) were also taken up by MoRTH. Further, Bharatmala Pariyojana is ongoing. For majority of the projects 
under NHDP and Bharatmala Pariyojana, NHAI is the implementation ag ency. Other NH related 
programmes/works are being implemented through agencies like National Highways Infrastructure 
Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL), State Public Works Departments (PWDs), State Road 
Development Corporations and the Border Road Organization. 
5.3.5 The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has made a big step towards improving the highway user 
experience, with the introduction of 'Rajmargyatra,' a citizen -centric unified mobile application. This user -
friendly app provides travellers with in -depth knowledge of Indian National Highways as well as an effective 
procedure for filing complaints.

5.3.6 National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has also recently introduced a ‘Knowledge Sharing’ platform for 
sharing of knowledge and innovative best practices. This effort, which is hosted on the NHAI website, will 
assist the authority in working with specialists and citizens who want to exchange knowledge and views about 
subjects including road design, construction, road safety, environmental sustainability, and related sectors. 
The platform will promote the exchange of best practices from all around the w orld and work to strengthen 
the nation's national highway system. 
5.3.7 MoRTH has defined a Vision 2047 for the National Highways sector which serves as the guiding principle for 
the Master Plan of National Highways and allied infrastructure. Vision 2047 for the National Highways aims 
to provide equity, efficiency and strategi c connectivity to meet 5 key objectives which are to access to high -
speed corridor within 100-150 km to all citizens, India to rank amongst top 10 countries in G20 for high-speed 
corridor density, equitable access to National Highways in under -developed re gions, improve passenger 
convenience with world class Passenger Amenities, reduction in logistics cost as a share of GDP 
5.3.8 The Government of India has been consistently revising the Model Concession Agreement for BOT projects 
to plug delays by imposing a deadline on the NHAI and incentivizing timely work by concessionaires. 
According to revised norms, the NHAI will have to hand over 90% of the project land (vacant and ready to 
build) to private developers, thus creating a more market-friendly sector and attracting more private players. 
5.3.9 Roads in the jurisdiction of state governments are under different categories like State Highways (“SHs”) and 
Major District Roads. They are being developed/ upgraded through State PWDs and State Road Development 
Corporations. Pradhan Mantri Gramm Sadak Yojana is being implemented for rural roads through the Ministry 
of Rural Affairs with active participation by state governments. Further, roads within urban areas are 
maintained/ developed mostly with PWDs and Urban Local Bodies.  
5.3.10 State Governments have a significant role to play in developing the SHs, Major District Roads, Other District 
Roads to ensure the last mile connectivity. States have varying levels of maturity in terms of road infrastructure 
development due to issues such as inadequate identification and prioritization of projects, funding shortfall, 
limited institutional capacity to implement projects, etc.

5.8.2 InVIT Model – NHAI has set up an InvIT under the SEBI InvIT Regulations, 2014 which is a pooled investment 
vehicle that issues units to investors, while having three entities for management of the Trust – Trustee, 
Investment Manager and Project Manager. The three ent ities have defined roles and responsibilities under 
the SEBI Regulations.  
5.8.3 Securitization through SPVs Model – A SPV/DME (100% owned by NHAI), has been created by bundling 
road assets under consideration and securitizing the future user fee from the road assets. NHAI will collect 
tolls, maintain the road assets and periodically transfer payments to the SPV suffi cient for servicing debt 
obligations at the SPV level. About Rs.3,70,000 Mn has already been raised through this method (DME- Delhi 
Mumbai Expressway) by NHAI so far.  
5.9 Utility Corridors 
Working towards development of around 10,000 km of Optic Fibre Cables (OFC) infrastructure across the 
country by FY2024-25, National Highways Logistics Management Limited (NHLML), a fully owned Company 
of NHAI, is implementing the network of Digital Highwa ys by developing integrated utility corridors along the 
National Highways to develop OFC infrastructure. Around 1,367 km on Delhi – Mumbai Expressway and 512 
km on Hyderabad - Bangalore Corridor have been identified for the Digital Highway Development. 
5.10 Public Private Partnership (“PPP”) Models of road development and maintenance in India 
5.10.1 India has a well-developed framework for Public-Private-Partnerships (PPP) in the highway sector. PPP has 
been a major contributor to the success story of the roads and highway sector in India. With the emergence 
of private players over the last decade, the road construction market has become fragmented and competitive. 
Players bidding for projects also vary in terms of size. PPP modes have been used in India for both 
development and operation & maintenance of road assets. 
  
 
 
5.11 Road Asset Development Models 
• BOT Toll  
In a BOT toll project, the concessionaire is responsible for designing, building, financing, operating, 
maintaining, tolling and transferring the project to the relevant authority at the end of the concession 
period. The concession period is project specific but is usually for 20-25 years. In BOT Toll model, the 
concessionaire earns revenue primarily in the form of toll revenue which in turns depends on the traffic 
on the road stretch. Toll rates are regulated by the government through rules.

• BOT Annuity  
Similar to a BOT Toll projects, is BOT Annuity project, the concessionaire is responsible for designing, 
building, financing, operating, maintaining, tolling and transferring the project to the relevant authority 
at the end of the concession period. However, in these projects, the right to collect toll on road stretch 
lies with the government. The concessionaire earns revenue in the form of pre -determined semi -
annual annuity payments. 
• HAM  
Similar to a BOT projects, in HAM project, the concessionaire is responsible for designing, building, 
financing, operating, maintaining and transferring the project to the relevant authority at the end of the 
concession period. However, in these projects, the right to collect toll on road stretch lies with the 
government. The construction period for HAM projects is project specific and a fixed operation period 
of 15 years.

5.13 Growth Drivers 
5.13.1 Robust Demand: 
In the period of April to March 2025, domestic sales of passenger vehicles reached 43,01,848 units. Sales of 
commercial vehicles totalled 9,56,671 units during the same period. Three -wheeler sales were recorded at 
7,41,420 units, while two -wheeler sales am ounted to 1,96,07,332 units. These figures reflect the strong 
demand across various segments in the automotive industry during this period. 
5.13.2 Increasing Investment: 
Under the Union Budget 2025-26, the government has allocated Rs. 2,87,333.3 crore (US$ 33.07 billion) to 
the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, reflecting a modest increase of 2.41% compared to the FY25. 
 
5.13.3 Policy Support: 
Infrastructure development is a critical driver of economic growth and development, and a reliable source of 
funding is essential to support the timely and efficient deployment of large -scale infrastructure projects. As 
such, NaBFID aims to be a key partne r in helping India achieve its ambitious infrastructure development 
objectives – responsibly and sustainably. To achieve its US$ 5 trillion ambition, it is imperative for 
infrastructure investment to grow annually at the rate of 8 -10% over the next 5 years . NaBFID is playing a 
pivotal role in helping India meet its arduous infrastructural resolve, by providing the necessary financing, 
expertise, technology, and analytics to support the development of this sector. 
5.14 Challenges & Issues in the Sector 
5.14.1 Land Acquisition Delays & Cost: 
• Land acquisition cost has increased more than 30% since 2017, primarily due to enhanced compensation 
payment requirements as per ‘The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, 
Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013’. 
• Delay in pre -construction activities (such as land acquisition, relocation) affects project timelines. Land 
acquisition for road projects involves various stages. Each stage involves a number of stakeholders and 
regulatory bodies. Thus processes consume considerable time. 
 
5.14.2 Regulatory Approvals & Disputes: 
• Road development process requires a number of  approvals such as environmental clearance, forest 
clearance, railways clearance, etc. Each of these activities takes considerable time and non -adherence to 
timelines result in cost overruns due to delays. 
• Claims arising out of disputes between the concessionaire/ contractor and the government authorities are 
also a significant cost which can lead to large liabilities. 
 
5.14.3 Operational Issues: 
• Uncertainty of toll revenue collection and variation of collected toll revenue compared to projected levels as 
Actual traffic is much less than the anticipated traffic.

• Often unforeseen weather conditions require unplanned O&M, over and above the routine and periodic 
maintenance activities. This results in enhanced O&M expenses. The increase in O&M costs is also affecting 
the project returns. 
 
5.14.4 Financing road construction projects: 
• In the case of toll motorways, the challenge of financing construction projects is different but still remains . 
Traditionally, the construction of toll motorways is a profitable investment but in the times of recession, funding 
may be rare or nonexistent. 
• Powerful national economies may be able to efficiently tackle the problem but weaker economies can hardly 
find the financing sources for road construction projects. 
 
5.14.5    Climate Change: 
• The road sector is vulnerable to climate change impacts. Climate change and extreme weather events pose 
a significant challenge to the safety, reliability, effectiveness and sustainability of road transportation systems. 
Tsunami waves, wildfires, floods and hurricanes constitute a big risk for passengers, vehicles and goods, as 
well as for the integrity of the transport infrastructure. 
• Since reliable road transport is an essential driver of economic growth and social wellbeing worldwide, 
national road authorities and motorway operators must adapt the infrastructure to climate change and 
increase the resilience of road transport to extreme weather 
 
5.14.6     Economy and cost effectiveness: 
• Among all transport modes, road transport occupies a significant place in short- and medium distance travel 
operations. However, the unit cost of transportation (per ton × km), compared with other modes of transport, 
remains high and is getting higher and cost ineffective as the travel distance increases.  
• Road transport cost comprises direct costs (fuel, capital depreciation, maintenance, motorway tolls, ferry 
fares and wages) and external costs (noise, congestion, infrastructure damages, health and environmental 
issues). 
 
a. Recent Initiatives by Government 
i. Bhoomi Rashi – Land Acquisition Portal 
The ministry has corroborated with the National Informatics Centre, to create Bhoomirashi, a web portal 
which   digitises the cumbersome land acquisition process, and also helps in processing notifications relating 
to land acquisition online. Processing time, which was earlier two to three months has come down to one to 
two weeks now. 
 
ii. Central Road and Infrastucuture Fund (CRF) 
A majority of the Ministry’s expenditure is managed through transfers from the CRIF. A portion of the cess 
collected on motor spirit and high-speed diesel is earmarked for the development of NHs and SHs, and the 
amount is transferred to the non-lapsable CRIF. This amount is eventually released to the NHAI, and to the 
state/UT governments for the development of road infrastructure, and other projects (such as ports, railway 
track, airports) in the country. For 2024 -25, the transfer from CRIF towards the Mini stry is estimated at Rs 
3,46,400 Mn. 
 
iii. National Investment Fund (NIF) 
The NIF was created in 2005, and is credited with proceeds from disinvestments of public sector enterprises. 
The Ministry finances the Special Accelerated Road Development Programme in North East (SARDP -NE) 
with funds from the NIF. 
 
iv. Investment in roads and other infrastructure 
• CareEdge Ratings estimates that India will require additional infrastructure investment of US$ 18-20 trillion 
in the next 25 years to become a US$ 25-30 trillion economy by 2047.

vi. Revival of languishing projects 
Projects which were languishing for a number of years have been attempted to be revived, with the help of 
a number of policy measures taken by the government. Some of the policy measures like Premium 
deferment in stressed projects, extension of concession period for languishing projects to the extent of delay 
not attributable to concessionaires, One Time Capital Support for physical completion of languishing 
projects that have achieved at least 50 per cent physical progress, through one time fund infusion by NHAI, 
subject to adequate due diligence on a case-to-case basis.  
 
vii. Rural development 
The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) has constructed 69,666.09 km of road length across 
India from 2022 to February 2025 under various ongoing initiatives. The government has also approved 
PMGSY-IV to connect 25,000 unconnected habitations, with a proposed 62,500 km of road length to be 
constructed at a cost of ₹70,125 crore from 2024-25 to 2028-29 
 
viii. Improve safety standards 
The Government of India has announced rules to improve road safety, such as fixed driving hours for 
commercial truck drivers and a mandate to install sleep detection sensors in commercial vehicles.  A 
memorandum of understanding (MoU) has been signed with the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) 
by Guru Nanak Dev University (GNDU) to conduct advanced research on various aspects, including 
highway architecture, protection and revitalisation. The GNDU will undertake studies on ~137 km length of 
the National Highways passing through Pathankot, Gurdaspur and Amritsar districts. 
 
ix. Portfolios in roads & highways sector 
The National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) is constantly making progress towards integrating 
its road and highway portfolio. The NIIF has acquired Essel Devanahalli Tollway and Essel Dichpally Tollway 
through the NIIF master fund. These road infra-projects will be supported by Athaang Infrastructure, NIIF's 
proprietary road network, assisted by a team of established professionals with diverse domain expertise in 
the transport field. 
 
x. International Tie-ups 
The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways signed a MoU with the Federal Ministry of Climate Action, 
Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology of the Republic of Austria on technology 
cooperation in the road infrastructure sector. 
 
xi. Encourage private funding to reduce finance constraints 
• The OPEC Fund for International Development (the OPEC Fund) is providing a US$100 million loan to the 
government of India for the financing of the Chennai Peripheral Ring Road Project – Sections II & III in 
partnership with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the State of Tamil Nadu. The loan will 
support the construction of more than 50 km of new roads, helping to ease congestion and commercial 
traffic to ports, while reducing pollution and travel times. Chennai port handles the second larg est volume 
of containers in India. 
• To date, the OPEC Fund has provided over US$350 million of public sector financing in India for around 20 
projects. The loans have supported energy, health, agriculture, education, transport and water & sanitation 
projects and promoted sustainable economic growth.

6. Valuation Methodology and Approach 
6.1. The present valuation exercise is being undertaken in order to derive the fair EV of the SPVs. 
6.2. The valuation exercise involves selecting a method suitable for the purpose of valuation, by exercise of 
judgment by the valuers, based on the facts and circumstances as applicable to the business of the company 
to be valued. 
6.3. There are three generally accepted approaches to valuation: 
(a) “Cost” approach 
(b) “Market” approach 
(c) “Income” approach 
6.4. Cost Approach 
The cost approach values the underlying assets of the business to determine the business value. This 
valuation method carries more weight with respect to holding companies than operating companies. Also, 
cost value approaches are more relevant to the exten t that a significant portion of the assets are of a nature 
that could be liquidated readily if so desired. 
 
Net Asset Value (“NAV”) Method 
The NAV Method under Cost Approach considers the assets and liabilities, including intangible assets and 
contingent liabilities. The Net Assets, after reducing the dues to the preference shareholders, if any, represent 
the value of a company. 
The NAV Method is appropriate in a case where the main strength of the business is its asset backing rather 
than its capacity or potential to earn profits. This valuation approach is also used in case s where the firm is 
to be liquidated, i.e. it does not meet the “Going Concern” criteria. 
As an indicator of the total value of the entity, the NAV method has the disadvantage of only considering the 
status of the business at one point in time.  
Additionally, NAV does not properly take into account the earning capacity of the business or any intangible 
assets that have no historical cost. In many aspects, NAV represents the minimum benchmark value of an 
operating business. 
 
6.5. Market Approach  
Under the Market approach, the valuation is based on the market value of the company in case of listed 
companies, and comparable companies’ trading or transaction multiples for unlisted companies. The Market 
approach generally reflects the investors’ perception about the true worth of the company.  
Comparable Companies Multiples (“CCM”) Method 
The value is determined on the basis of multiples derived from valuations of comparable companies, as 
manifest in the stock market valuations of listed companies. This valuation is based on the principle that 
market valuations, taking place between informed buyers and informed sellers, incorporate all factors relevant 
to valuation.  Relevant multiples need to be chosen carefully and adjusted for differe nces between the 
circumstances. 
 
Comparable Transactions Multiples (“CTM”) Method 
Under the CTM Method, the value is determined on the basis of multiples derived from valuations of similar 
transactions in the industry. Relevant multiples need to be chosen carefully and adjusted for differences 
between the circumstances. Few of such mult iples are EV/Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & 
Amortization (“EBITDA”) multiple and EV/Revenue multiple. 
 
Market Price Method 
Under this method, the market price of an equity share of the company as quoted on a recognized stock 
exchange is normally considered as the fair value of the equity shares of that company where such quotations 
are arising from the shares being regularly and freely traded. The market value generally reflects the investors’ 
perception about the true worth of the company.

6.6. Income Approach  
The income approach is widely used for valuation under "Going  Concern" basis. It focuses on the income 
generated by the company in the past as well as its future earning capability. The Discounted Cash Flow 
Method under the income approach seeks to arrive at a valuation based on the strength of future cash flows.  
DCF Method 
Under DCF Method value of a company can be assessed using the FCFF or Free Cash Flow to Equity Method 
(“FCFE”). Under the DCF method, the business is valued by discounting its free cash flows for the explicit 
forecast period and the perpetuity value thereafter. The free cash flows represent the cash available for 
distribution to both, the owners and creditors of  the business. The free cash flows in the explicit period and 
those in perpetuity are discounted by the WACC. The WACC, based on an optimal vis -à-vis actual capital 
structure, is an appropriate rate of discount to calculate the present value of future cash flows as it considers 
equity-debt risk by incorporating debt-equity ratio of the firm. 
The perpetuity (terminal) value is calculated based on the business’ potential for further growth beyond the 
explicit forecast period. The “Constant Growth Model” is applied, which implies an expected constant level of 
growth for perpetuity in the cash flows over the last year of the forecast period. 
The discounting factor (rate of discounting the future cash flows) reflects not only the time value of money, 
but also the risk associated with the business’ future operations. The EV (aggregate of the present value of 
explicit period and terminal period cash flows) so derived, is further reduced by the value of debt, if any, (net 
of Cash and Cash Equivalents) to arrive at value to the owners of the business. 
 
Conclusion on Valuation Approach 
6.7. It is pertinent to note that the valuation of any company or its assets is inherently imprecise and is subject to 
certain uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are difficult to predict and are beyond my control. In 
performing my analysis, I have made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance and 
general business and economic conditions, many of which are beyond the control of the SPV s. In addition, 
this valuation will fluctuate with changes in prevailing market conditions, and prospects, financial and 
otherwise, of the SPV s, and other factors which generally influence the valuation of companies and their 
assets. 
6.8. The goal in selection of valuation approaches and methods for any business is to find out the most appropriate 
method under particular circumstances on the basis of available information. No one method is suitable in 
every possible situation. Before selecting the appropriate valuation approach and method, I have considered 
various factors, inter-alia, the basis and premise of current valuation exercise, purpose of valuation exercise, 
respective strengths and weaknesses of the possible valuation approach and  methods, availability of 
adequate inputs or information and its reliability and valuation approach and methods considered by the 
market participants.

6.9. Cost Approach 
In the present case, the SPVs operate and maintain the project facilities in accordance with the terms and 
conditions under the relevant concession agreement(s). During the concession period, the SPVs operate and 
maintain their respective road assets and earn revenues through annuity payment that are pre -determined 
as per the respective concession agreement. In such scenario, the true worth of the business is reflected in 
its future earning capacity rather than the cost of the project. Accordingly, I have not considered the cost 
approach for the current valuation exercise.

non-current assets and working capital based on the Unaudited financial statements as at 30th September

6.10. Market Approach 
The present valuation exercise is to undertake fair EV of the SPVs engaged in the road infrastructure projects 
for a predetermined tenure. Further, the tariff revenue and expenses are very specific to the SPVs depending 
on the nature of their geographical location, stage of project, terms of profitability. In the absence of any 
exactly comparable listed companies with characteristics and parameters similar to that of the SPVs, I have 
not considered CCM method in the present case. In the absence of adequate details about independent 
Comparable Transactions, I was unable to apply the CTM method  as a measure of valuation. Currently, the 
equity shares of the SPVs are not listed on any recognized stock exchange of India. Hence, I was unable to 
apply market price method.  
 
6.11. Income Approach 
Each of the SPVs operates under a DBOT based concession agreement with NHAI. 
Currently, The revenue of the SPVs is based on tenure, annuity payments, operations and other factors that 
are unique to each of the SPVs. 
The revenue of the SPVs is based on tenure, annuity payments, operations and other factors that are 
unique to each of the SPVs. The revenue of the SPVs is mainly derived from the annuity payments (annuity 
fees), interest income on balance annuity payments (which is linked to bank rate) and O&M payments 
(adjusted for inflation), that is defined under respective Concession Agreement for operation period.  
The annuity amounts are typically pre-determined with the relevant government authority (NHAI in this case) 
and cannot be modified to reflect prevailing circumstances. Interest on balance annuity payments are linked 
to bank rate, which is changed by RBI based on prevailing ma rket conditions. The rights in relation to the 
underlying assets of all the SPVs shall be transferred after the expiry of the Concession Period. Accordingly, 
since all the SPVs are generating income based on pre -determined agreements / mechanism and since the 
Investment Manager has provided me with the financial projections of the SPVs for the balance tenor of the 
concession agreements, DCF Method under the income approach has been considered as the appropriate 
method for the present valuation exercise.

In the present exercise, my objective is to determine the Fair Enterprise Value of the SPVs as per the DCF 
Method. EV is described as the total value of the equity in a business plus the value of its debt and debt 
related liabilities, minus any cash or cas h equivalents to meet those liabilities. Accordingly, in the present 
case, I have considered it appropriate to consider cash flows at FCFF (Free Cash Flow to Firm) level i.e., 
cash flows that are available to all the providers of capital (equity shareholders, preference shareholders and 
lenders). Therefore, cash flows required to service lenders and preference shareholders such as interest, 
dividend, repayment of principal amount and even additional fund raising are not considered in the calculation 
of FCFF.  
 
While carrying out this engagement, I have relied extensively on the information made available to me by the 
Investment Manager. I have considered projected financial statement of the SPVs as provided by the 
Investment Manager. I have not tested individual  assumptions or attempted to substantiate the veracity or 
integrity of such assumptions in relation to the forward -looking financial information, however, I have made 
sufficient enquiries to satisfy myself that such information has been prepared on a reaso nable basis. 
Notwithstanding anything above, I cannot provide any assurance that the forward-looking financial information 
will be representative of the results which will actually be achieved during the cash flow forecast period. 
 
Following are the major steps I have considered in order to arrive at the EV of the SPVs as per the DCF 
Method: 
 
• Determination of Free Cash Flows to Firm which included: 
a) Obtaining the financial projections to determine the cash flows expected to be generated by the SPVs 
from the Investment Manager; 
b) Analyzed the projections and its underlying assumptions to assess the reasonableness of the cash 
flows; 
• Determination of the discount rate; and Applying the discount rate to arrive at the present value of the cash 
flows.

7. Valuation of the SPVs 
7.1 The key conclusions of the projections provided to me by the Investment Manager are: 
 
7.1.1 Revenue cash flows 
 
The Cash flow for the SPVs can be divided into two segments: 
Payment NHAI during the Construction Period: 
Each SPV was eligible to receive 40% of the Bid Project Cost, adjusted for the price index multiple, in 5 
equal installments during the construction period . I have been represented by the Investment Manager 
that all the SPVs have received the agreed portion of the inflation adjusted bid project cost (of 40%) as 
per their respective concession agreement. Hence, no further cash flow receipts are attributable towards 
this segment of cash flows. 
Payment by NHAI during the Operation Period: Accordingly, the revenue of the SPVs would mainly 
consists of the following receipts: 
a. Annuity payments: The Bid Project Cost remaining, adjusted for the price index multiple, to be paid in 
pursuance of the respective concession agreements (i.e. the Balance Completion Cost) is eligible to be 
received by the respective SPVs by way of specified  biannual installments as mentioned in their 
respective concession agreement for the balance period of operations. 
b. Interest: As per the concession agreements, the SPVs are entitled to receive interest on reducing 
Balance Completion Cost equal to applicable Bank Rate (as decided by the Monetary Policy Committee 
and published by the Reserve Bank of India) + 3.00% spread. Such interest is due and payable along 
with each of the biannual installments as mentioned above;

c. Operation and Maintenance Revenue : In lieu of O&M expenses to be incurred by SPV, SPVs are 
eligible for certain O&M income (as defined in the respective concession agreement) at each biannual 
installment date, duly adjusted for an appropriate inflation rate. 
(Refer Appendix 1 for detailed revenue breakup) 
 
7.1.2 Operating and Maintenance Expenses: 
Since all the SPVs are operational on the Valuation Date, following are the major costs incurred by the 
SPVs: 
Operation and Maintenance Costs (Routine) (“O&M Costs”) 
These are routine costs incurred every year. These costs are related to the normal wear and tear of the 
road and hence involve repairing the patches damaged mainly due to heavy traffic movement. O&M Costs 
also include staff salaries, project management fees, professional fees, insurance, security expenses, 
electricity, etc. The primary purpose of these expenses is to maintain the road as per the specifications 
mentioned in the respective concession agreement. SPV is generally responsible for carrying out 
operation and maintenance activities at its road during its concession period .  The following table shows 
the broad breakup of O&M  and PM Fees, CSR Expenses and Other Expenses for FY 27, which is used 
in our valuation: 
         INR Mn 
Particulars GNHPL GKBHPL HHHPL GRJHPL GKNHPL GRSHPL DUHPL GBHPL GNHPL II 
O&M and PM

Total 132 144 145 102 223 118 97 159 90 
 
O&M and PM Fees  are projected to escalate by ~5% p.a. based on the  contract provided by the 
Investment Manager (“ Project Management Agreement ”) and executed between the Trustee, the 
Investment Manager, GCL and the CIT SPVs. 
 
 
7.1.3 Estimating the Major Maintenance and Repairs Costs (“MMR Costs”): 
Major maintenance expenses will be incurred on a periodic basis. These are the costs incurred to bring 
the road assets back to its earlier condition or keep the road assets in its normal condition as per the 
concession agreement terms. These expenses are primarily related to the construction or re-laying of the 
top layer of the road. Accordingly, such costs include considerable amounts of materials and labour.  
MMR cost are projected to escalate by ~5% p.a. based on the Project Management Agreement contract 
provided by the Investment Manager and executed between the Trustee, the Investment Manager, GCL 
and the CIT SPVs. 
 
7.1.4 Capital Expenditure (“Capex”):  
As represented by the Investment Manager, regarding the Capex  (subject to availability of land from 
NHAI), there is projected capex amounting to INR 272 Mn, INR 99 Mn, INR 133 Mn & INR 187 Mn  in 
HHHPL, DUHPL, GBHPL and GNHPL II respectively. 
 
7.1.5 Direct Taxes: As per the discussions with the Investment Manager, the new provisions of Income Tax 
Act, 1961 (Section 115BAA) have been considered for the projected period of all SPVs except GBHPL & 
GNHPL II for which Old Tax Regime has been followed.  The SPVs have been filing their income tax 
returns basis the IND AS Income, adjusted for adjustments prescribed by Income Computation and 
Deduction Standards III & IV, which can be substantiated from the tax audit reports of the respective 
SPVs. I have relied on the representation of the Investment Manager for the projected tax outflow for the 
projected period.

The biannual period are based on the annuity dates of the respective SPVs. The amount of O&M expenses 
payable to Project Manager by the SPV and Project Manager to O&M Contractor on the basis of their 
respective O&M Agreements is also due and payable on the basis of the annuity amount and date on 
which annuities are received. Hence, for all the SPVs where annuity payments are material component of 
revenue, there are no receivables and payables estimated to be outstanding at their respective annuity 
dates during the biannually prepared projected period. Other working capital items outstanding as at the 
Valuation Date mainly represents the advance income tax,  GST input tax (and cash) credit, prepaid 
expenses, etc. that are separately adjusted in the calculation of the enterprise values of the SPVs. The 
Investment Manager has provided projected Working Capital information for all the SPVs. I have relied on 
the same. 
 
7.1.7 GST Claim: The Investment Manager has informed us that due to the changes in extant provision of the 
Goods & Services Tax (“GST”) laws, the SPVs are eligible to receive GST claim from NHAI which are as 
follows: 
 
i. On Annuity: As per the clarification notification of Ministry of Road Transport & Highways as on 27 th 
August 2021 vis -à-vis Ministry of Finance circular dated 17 th June 2021, SPVs are eligible to claim 
reimbursement of GST on annuity, considering change in law, after adjusting GST input credit lying with 
the SPVs. 
ii. On Interest on Annuity:  As per the Ministry of Finance circular dated 17 th June 2021, GST will be 
applicable on annuity (deferred payments) paid for construction of roads i.e. annuity plus interest, 
additionally Ministry of Road Transport & Highways issued clarification dated 17th June 2021 that the SPVs 
will be eligible to claim reimbursement of GST on interest. 
iii. Change in GST rates: Ministry of Finance vide notification no. 03/2022 dated 13 th July 2022, increased 
the GST rates applicable on road construction services from 12% to 18%. As per the clarification of 
Ministry of Road Transport & Highways dated 20th September 2022, the above increase in GST rates are 
eligible for reimbursement from NHAI as it is considered as change in law (i.e. change of rate). 
 
7.2    Impact of Ongoing Material Litigation on Valuation   
As on 30th September 2025, there are no ongoing material litigations except as shown in Appendix 5. 
Further, Investment Manager has informed us that majority of the tax litigations are low to medium risk and 
accordingly no material outflow is expected against the litigations, hence  no impact has been factored on 
the valuation of the SPVs. Further, I have been informed by the Investment Manager that the tax litigations 
prior to acquisition of SPVs by the Trust shall be covered by an indemnity given by the Sponsor (Gawar 
Construction Limited) for a period of eight years (from date of such transfer) through the Share Purchase 
Agreement (“SPA”) to be executed between the Trust and the Sponsor. 
 
 
7.3 Calculation of Weighted Average Cost of Capital for the SPVs 
7.3.1 Cost of Equity:  
Cost of Equity (CoE) is a discounting factor to calculate the returns expected by the equity holders depending 
on the perceived level of risk associated with the business and the industry in which the business operates. 
For this purpose, I have used the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which is a commonly used model to 
determine the appropriate cost of equity for the SPVs. 
K(e) = Rf + [ERP* Beta] + CSRP 
Wherein: 
K(e) = cost of equity 
Rf = risk free rate 
ERP = Equity Risk Premium  
Beta = a measure of the sensitivity of assets to returns of the overall market 
CSRP = Company Specific Risk Premium (In general, an additional company -specific risk premium will be 
added to the cost of equity calculated pursuant to CAPM).

Page 70 of 112 
 
 
For valuation exercise, I have arrived at the adjusted cost of equity of the SPVs based on the above calculation 
(Refer Appendix 2). 
 
7.3.2 Risk Free Rate: 
I have applied a risk-free rate of return of  6.72% on the basis of the zero-coupon yield curve as on 30th 
September 2025 for government securities having a maturity period of 10 years, as quoted on the website of 
Clearing Corporation of India Limited . For comparison, the previous valuation as of June 2025 used a risk-
free rate of 6.46%. 
7.3.3 Equity Risk Premium (“ERP”): 
        The Equity Risk Premium (ERP) is a measure of the additional return that investors require for investing in 
equity markets over risk -free assets, such as government bonds. It is typically estimated by comparing 
historical realised returns on equity with th e risk -free rate, often represented by 10 -year government 
securities. For my estimation of the ERP for India, I have analysed rolling historical returns of the Nifty 50 
Index over 10-year, 15-year, and 20-year periods, covering data from 2000 to 2025. As o f 30th September, 
the calculated ERP based on these rolling return periods stands at 6.42%, 6.71% and 7.53% for the 10-year, 
15-year and 20-year periods respectively. These figures indicate variability in ERP over different investment 
horizons, but collectively they suggest a range around 6% to 8%. Considering the historical trends, variability 
across periods, and long -term expectations, an equity risk premium of 7% for India continues to be an 
appropriate and reasonable assumption.  For comparison, the previous valuation as of June 2025 used an 
Equity Risk Premium of 7.00%. 
 
7.3.4 Debt-Equity Ratio: 
I have considered the target debt -equity ratio as per the industry standards. I have considered the industry 
bench mark since the cost of capital is a forward looking measure and captures the cost of raising new funds 
to buy the asset at any valuation date (not the current actually deployed). Specifically, such benchmark is 
required to consider the nature of the asset class, and the comparative facts from the industry to arrive at the 
correct assumption. 
Current Net Debt to EV: 52.52% 
Given the risk profile of HAM projects, and considering the leverage at 70-80% of the total project cost based 
on a rating agencies report available in public domain, and further considering the InvIT Regulations allowing 
in general upto 70% leverage in assets where AAA rating has been obtained,  a debt-to-equity ratio of 70% 
for HAM asset was found to be appropriate.  For comparison, the previous valuation as of June 2025 used a 
Debt-Equity Ratio of 70%.  
 
7.3.5 Beta: 
Beta is a measure of the sensitivity of a company’s stock price to the movements of the overall market index. 
In the present case, I find it appropriate to consider the beta of companies in similar business/ industry to that 
of the SPVs for an appropriate period. 
For the valuation of the SPVs, I find it appropriate to consider the beta of PG InvIT and IRB InvIT fund for an 
appropriate period. The beta so arrived, is further adjusted based on the factors of mentioned SPVs like 
completion of projects, revenue certainty, past collection trend, lack of execution uncertainty, etc. to arrive at 
the adjusted unlevered beta appropriate to the SPVs. 
I have further unlevered the beta of such companies based on market debt-equity of the respective company 
using the following formula: 
Unlevered Beta = Levered Beta / [1 + (Debt / Equity) *(1-T)] 
Further I have re -levered it based on debt -equity at 70:30 based on the industry Debt: Equity ratio of HAM 
based projects using the following formula:  
Re-levered Beta = Unlevered Beta * [1 + (Debt / Equity) *(1-T)] 
Accordingly, as per above, I have arrived at re-levered betas of the SPVs.

7.3.6 Company Specific Risk Premium (“CSRP”): 
As the risk inherent in achieving the future cash flows. In the present case, considering the counter-party risk 
for Discount Rate is the return expected by a market participant from a particular investment and shall reflect 
not only the time value of money but also the risk inherent in the asset being valued as well certain SPVs, 
considering the length of the explicit period for the SPVs, and basis my discussion with Investment Manager, 
I found it appropriate to 0% CSRP for the SPVs. For comparison, the previous valuation as of June 2025 used 
a CSRP of 0%.  
7.3.7 Cost of Debt: 
The calculation of Cost of Debt post-tax can be defined as follows: 
K(d) = K(d) pre-tax * (1 - T) 
Wherein: 
K(d) = Cost of debt 
T = tax rate as applicable 
For valuation exercise, pre -tax cost of debt has been considered as 7.68%, as per Management 
Representation Letter for all the SPVs. For comparison, in the previous valuation exercise as of June 2025, 
a Cost of Debt of 7.68% was considered. 
Given the risk profile of HAM projects, and considering the leverage at 70-80% of the total project cost based 
on a rating agencies report available in public domain, and further considering the InvIT Regulations allowing 
in general upto 70% leverage in assets where AAA rating has been obtained, a debt -to-equity ratio of 70% 
for HAM asset was found to be appropriate. For comparison, the previous valuation as of June 2025 used a 
Debt-Equity Ratio of 70%. 
 
7.3.8 Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): 
The discount rate, or the WACC, is the weighted average of the expected return on equity and the cost of 
debt. The weight of each factor is determined based on the company’s optimal capital structure. 
Formula for calculation of WACC: 
WACC = [K(d) * Debt /(Debt + Equity)] + [K(e) * (1 - Debt /(Debt + Equity))] 
Accordingly, as per above, I have arrived the WACC for the explicit period of the SPVs. For comparison, the 
previous valuation as of June 2025 Is shown in the below Table: 
 
Particulars GNHPL GKBHPL HHHPL GRJHPL GKNHPL GRSHPL DUHPL GBHPL GNHPL II 
Jun-25 7.12% 7.12% 7.12% 7.12% 7.12% 7.12% 7.12% 6.95% 6.91% 
Sep-25 7.13% 7.13% 7.18% 7.14% 7.13% 7.13% 7.13% 6.91% 6.97% 
(Refer Appendix 2 for detailed workings).  
7.3.9 Cash Accrual Factor (CAF) and Discounting Factor 
Discounted cash flow require to forecast cash flows in future and discount them to the present in order to 
arrive at present value of the asset as on Valuation Date. To discount back the projections we use the Cash 
Accrual Factor (“CAF”). The Cash Accrual Factor refers to the duration between the Valuation date and the 
point at which each cash flow is expected to accrue.  
In case of HAM Projects, the annuities are received bi-annually at a predetermined date and the concession 
agreement provides that the annuities would be realized in 15 days from the annuity date. However, based 
on management’s representation, it has been assumed that the annuties will be realised within 7 days from 
the annuity  date. Hence we have considered appropriate annuity realizations date for the purpose of 
determination of the CAF. Accordingly, the cash flows during each year of the projected period are discounted 
back from the respective annuity realization to Valuation Date. 
 
Discounted cash flow is equal to sum of the cash flow in each period divided by discounting factor, where the 
discounting factor is determined by raising one plus discount rate (WACC) to the power of the CAF. 
DCF = [CF1 / (1+r)CAF1] + [CF2 / (1+r)CAF2] + ... + [CFn /(1+r)CAFn] 
Where,  
CF = Cash Flows, 
CAF = Cash accrual factor for particular period 
         R = Discount Rate (i.e. WACC)

7.4 At the end of the agreed concession period, the rights in relation to the underlying assets, its operations and 
the obligation to maintain the road revert s to the government authority that granted the concession. Hence, 
SPVs are not expected to generate cash flow after the expiry of their respective concession agreements . 
Accordingly, I found it appropriate not to consider terminal period value, which represents the present value 
at the end of explicit forecast period of all subsequent cash flows to the end of the life of the asset or into 
perpetuity if the asset has an indefinite life, in this valuation exercise.

8 Valuation Conclusion 
8.1 The current valuation has been carried out based on the discussed valuation methodology  explained herein 
earlier. Further, various qualitative factors, the business dynamics and growth potential of the business, 
having regard to information base, management perceptions, key underlying assumptions and limitations 
were given due consideration. 
8.2 I have been represented by the Investment Manager that there is no potential devolvement on account of the 
contingent liability as of valuation date; hence no impact has been factored in to arrive at fair EV of the SPVs. 
8.3 Based on the above analysis, the fair EV and Adjusted Enterprise Value as on the Valuation Date of the SPVs 
is as mentioned below:

  * Enterprise Value (“EV”) is described as the total value of the equity in a business plus the value of its debt 
and debt related liabilities, minus any Cash and Cash Equivalents to meet those liabilities.  
** Adjusted Enterprise Value of the SPVs is derived as the EV as defined above plus Cash and Cash 
Equivalents of the SPVs as at the Valuation Date.  
8.4 EV is described as the total value of the equity in a business plus the value of its debt and debt related 
liabilities, minus any Cash and Cash Equivalents to meet those liabilities. 
8.5 Adjusted Enterprise Value is derived as EV as defined above plus Cash and Cash Equivalents of the SPVs 
as at 30th September 2025. 
8.6 The fair EV of the SPVs is estimated using DCF method. The valuation requires Investment Manager to make 
certain assumptions about the model inputs including forecast cash flows, discount rate, and credit risk. 
8.7 Valuation is based on estimates of future financial performance or opinions, which represent reasonable 
expectations at a particular point of time, but such information, estimates or opinions are not offered as 
predictions or as assurances that a particular level of income or profit will be achieved, a particular event will 
occur or that a particular price will be offered or accepted. Actual results achieved during the period covered 
by the prospective financial analysis will vary from these estimates and the variations may be material. 
8.8 Accordingly, I have conducted a quantitative sensitivity analysis on certain model inputs, the results of which 
are as indicated below: 
a. WACC by increasing / decreasing it by 0.25% (performed at the request of management) 
b. WACC by increasing / decreasing it by 0.5% 
c. WACC by increasing / decreasing it by 1.0% 
d. Bank rate by increasing / decreasing it by 0.25% (performed at the request of management) 
e. Total Expenses by increasing / decreasing it by 20%

11.4 The scope of my assignment did not involve me performing audit tests for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the fairness or accuracy of any financial or analytical information that was provided and used by 
me during the course of my work. The assignment did not involve me to conduct the financial or technical 
feasibility study. I have not done any independent technical valuation or appraisal or due diligence of the 
assets or liabilities of the SPVs or any of other entity mentioned in this Report and have considered them at 
the value as disclosed by the SPVs in their regulatory filings or in submissions, oral or written, made to me. 
11.5 In addition, I do not take any responsibility for any changes in the information used by me to arrive at my 
conclusion as set out here in which may occur subsequent to the date of my Report or by virtue of fact that

11.7 This Report is intended for the sole use in connection with the purpose as set out above. It can however be 
relied upon and disclosed in connection with any statutory and regulatory filing in connection with the provision 
of SEBI InvIT Regulations. However, I will not accept any responsibility to any other party to whom this Report

11.8 It is clarified that this Report is not a fairness opinion under any of the stock exchange/ listing regulations. In 
case of any third party having access to this Report, please note this Report is not a substitute for the third

on an analysis of information available to me and within the scope of my engagement, others may place a 
different value on this business. 
11.12 Any discrepancies in any table / appendix between the total and the sums of the amounts listed are due to 
rounding-off. 
11.13 Valuation is based on estimates of future financial performance or opinions, which represent reasonable 
expectations at a particular point of time, but such information, estimates or opinions are not offered as 
predictions or as assurances that a particular level of income or profit will be achieved, a particular event will 
occur or that a particular price will be offered or accepted. Actual results achieved during the period covered 
by the prospective financial analysis will vary from these estimates and the variations may be material. 
11.14 I do not carry out any validation procedures or due diligence with respect to the information provided/extracted 
or carry out any verification of the assets or comment on the achievability and reasonableness of the 
assumptions underlying the financial forecasts, save for satisfying ourselves to the extent possible that they 
are consistent with other information provided to me in the course of this engagement. 
11.15 My conclusion assumes that the assets and liabilities of the SPVs, reflected in their respective latest balance 
sheets remain intact as of the Report date. 
11.16 Whilst all reasonable care has been taken to ensure that the factual statements in the Report are accurate, 
neither myself, nor any of my associates, officers or employees shall in any way be liable or responsible either 
directly or indirectly for the contents stated herein. Accordingly, I make no representation or warranty, express 
or implied, in respect of the completeness, authenticity or accuracy of such factual statements. I expressly 
disclaim any and all liabilities, which may arise based upon the information used in this Report. I am not liable 
to any third party in relation to the issue of this Report. 
11.17 The scope of my work has been limited both in terms of the areas of the business & operations which I have 
reviewed and the extent to which I have reviewed them. There may be matters, other than those noted in this 
Report, which might be relevant in the context of the transaction and which a wider scope might uncover. 
11.18 For the present valuation exercise, I have also relied on information available in public domain; however the 
accuracy and timelines of the same has not been independently verified by me. 
11.19 In the particular circumstances of this case, my liability (in contract or under any statute or otherwise) for any 
economic loss or damage arising out of or in connection with this engagement, however the loss or damage 
caused, shall be limited to the amount of fees actually received by me from the Investment Manager, as laid 
out in the engagement letter for such valuation work. 
11.20 In rendering this Report, I have not provided any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or actuarial advice  or 
opinion and accordingly I do not assume any responsibility or liability in respect thereof. 
11.21 This Report does not address the relative merits of investing in InvIT as compared with any other alternative 
business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are 
available.  
11.22 I am not an advisor with respect to legal , tax and regulatory matters for the transaction  occurred. No 
investigation of the SPVs’ claim to title of assets has been made for the purpose of this Report and the SPVs’ 
claim to such rights have been assumed to be valid. No consideration has been given to liens or 
encumbrances against the assets, beyond the loans disclosed in the accounts. Therefore, no responsibility 
is assumed for matters of a legal nature. 
11.23 I have no present or planned future interest in the Trustee, Investment Manager or the SPVs and the fee for 
this Report is not contingent upon the values reported herein. My valuation analysis should not be construed 
as investment advice; specifically, I do not express any opinion on the suitability or otherwise of entering into 
any financial or other transaction with the Investment Manager or SPVs. 
11.24 I have submitted the draft valuation report to the Trust and Investment Manager for confirmation of accuracy 
of the factual data used in my analysis and to prevent any error or inaccuracy in this Report.

Source: Information provided by database sources, market research, other published data and internal workings. Raw Beta Considered has been derived 
from S&P Capital IQ. 
 
Justification of Companies used for calculation of Beta for SPV: 
 
The following companies are integral players in the Indian infrastructure sector and contributes significantly to the development, operation and maintenance 
of infrastructure project. Their strong market presence, diversified portfolios and cosistent involvement in the key infrastructure projects make them relevant 
for the computation of beta of HAM SPV in the context of road business valuation. 
 
1. IRB InvIT Fund 
The IRB InvIT Fund is a dedicated infrastructure trust that manages toll road assets across India, with a portfolio comprising six operational highway projects. Its focused 
strategy within the transportation infrastructure sector and operational maturity positions it as a relevant peer in the broa der infrastructure trust landscape. Structurally, 
IRB InvIT shares several characteristics with Capital Infra Trust — both are SEBI-registered InvITs with stable, income -generating infrastructure assets and long -term 
cash flow visibility. These similarities make IRB InvIT a reasonable comparable for evaluating Capital Infra Trust, particularly in the context of computing beta for valuation 
purposes. Moreover, like Capital Infra Trust, IRB InvIT is currently operating and generating cash flows from completed assets, thereby offering a realistic p roxy for risk-
return dynamics in the infrastructure domain. Both entities offer annuity-like cash flows, similar investor profiles, and comparable regulatory frameworks. For these reasons, 
IRB InvIT is considered an appropriate peer for beta estimation in the valuation analysis of Capital Infra Trust. 
 
2. PG InvIT 
PowerGrid InvIT (PG InvIT) primarily owns and operates high -voltage power transmission lines, which form a critical component of India’s electricity infrastructure. The 
trust earns regulated revenues through long -term, fixed-fee contracts with utilities, offering predictable and stable cash flows over extended periods.  Capital Infra Trust, 
while operating in a different sector—Roads Sector—shares key structural and financial characteristics with PG InvIT. Both entities are SEBI-registered InvITs with long-
term contracted revenues, asset-heavy models, and yield-focused investment propositions. These similarities support the application of standard infrastructure valuation 
methodologies such as the  Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)  approach, which emphasizes long -term cash flow generation and yield expectations. From a capital market 
perspective, both InvITs are designed to deliver long -term returns to investors through consistent distributions, making them suitable peers in a compa rative valuation 
context.
