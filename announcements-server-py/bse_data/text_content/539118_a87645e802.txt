Dear Sir / Madam, 
 
Sub: Disclosure under Regulation 30 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations 2015 – Credit Rating – Reg.  
 
As required under Regulation 30, read with Schedule III of SEBI (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, we wish to inform you that ICRA Limited has 
revised the Long-term Fund -based-Term Loan  and Long-term Fund-based-Working Capital 
Loan related Credit rating of the Company from [ICRA] A+ Stable to [ICRA] A+ Positive. 
 
The revision in the outlook on the long -term rating of VRL Logistics Limited (VRL) to Positive 
factors in the expectation that the company will sustain the growth momentum in its core 
goods transport business, supported by expansion in its fleet and branch network. Coupled 
with recent revision in freight rates as well as VRL’s exit from a low-margin business, this will 
lead to improved profitability over historical levels in the near to medium term. 
 
You are requested to kindly take note of the same. 
 
For VRL LOGISTICS LIMITED
