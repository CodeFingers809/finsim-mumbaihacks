(LODR) Regulations, 2015 
  
Dear Sir/Madam, 
 
This has reference to your email dated November 20, 2025 regarding your query with respect to Regulation 33 of 
the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 for the period ended September 30, 
2025. 
 
We sincerely regret the inadvertent omission of the Cash Flow Statement in the earlier submission of the Standalone 
Financial Results. The Cash Flow Statement has since been duly compiled, and the complete set of Financial Results, 
along with the Limited Review Report, has now been uploaded in both PDF and XBRL formats on the BSE Listing 
Centre. 
 
We request you to kindly take the revised submission on record. 
 
Thank you for bringing this to our attention. 
 
Yours Sincerely, 
 
For Alna Trading and Exports Limited

Independent Auditors’ Review Report on the Quarterly Unaudited Financial Results 
of Alna Trading and Exports Limited Pursuant to the Regulations 33 of the SEBI 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended. 
The Board of Directors 
Alna Trading and Exports Limited 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Unaudited Financial Results of Alna Trading 
and Exports Limited (“the Company”) for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025 
(‘the Statement”), attached herewith being submitted by the Company pursuant to the 
requirement of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, as amended (‘the Listing Regulations”), read with SEBI Circular No. 
CIR/CFD/FAC/62/2016 dated Sth July, 2016 (“the Circular”). 
2. The Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company’s management and approved by the 
Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement 
principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting (Ind AS 34) 
prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 as amended, read with relevant rules 
issued thereunder and other accounting principal generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is 
to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent 
Auditor of the Entity", issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of 
interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for 
financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and 
consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all 
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit 
opinion. 
4, Based on our review conducted as stated above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us 
to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in the applicable Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) 
specified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with relevant rules issued thereunder 
and other recognised accounting practices and principles generally accepted in India, has not 
disclosed the information required to be disclosed in accordance with the Listing Regulations, read 
with SEBI Circular No. CIR/CFD/FAC/62/2016 dated 5"July, 2016, including the manner in which it 
is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
