Capital Infra Trust04
Introduction
In a country as diverse as India, building infrastructure means 
more than just about laying down roads and highways. It is 
about connecting people to new opportunities and supporting 
inclusive growth.
Capital Infra Trust was born with this 
vision. As a SEBI-registered infrastructure 
investment trust, we manage road networks 
that help the nation move forward. Our 
portfolio stretches over 680 kilometres 
across India. In the coming years, we 
plan to reach a market size of nearly 
USD 5 billion. This ambition reflects our 
commitment to elevating the lives of people. 
We aim to deliver long-term value to our 
investors through annuity-linked revenue 
streams from the National Highways 
Authority of India. Each asset in our portfolio 
reflects expert asset management with 
innovative structuring, disciplined risk 
management and transparency. Capital 
Infra Trust combines disciplined governance 
with smart structuring to deliver sustainable, 
low-risk returns. 
Through a performance-driven Project 
Management Agreement (PMA) and a 
stringently governed Right of First Offer 
(ROFO) structure, we ensure long-term 
value creation. Every asset we add to our 
portfolio undergoes meticulous reviews. 
The robust foundation that we have built 
helps us deliver enduring value to our 
stakeholders. 
Our role goes beyond asset ownership. 
We see ourselves as facilitators of a mega 
infrastructure-led growth story that touches 
and elevates all stakeholders.

Future Outlook
India’s infrastructure sector is entering a new phase of evolution - one defined 
by increased focus on financing models, proactive policy support and rising 
investor participation.
As the sector shifts towards efficiency, transparency and sustainability, platforms like Capital Infra Trust are emerging as pivotal enablers 
of long-term value creation. By leveraging capital recycling opportunities and fostering alignment between capital, governance and 
strategy, we aim to contribute to the infrastructure growth in the country. The following focus areas capture our outlook for this journey.

MONETISATION OF OPERATIONAL 
ASSETS BY DEVELOPERS
A growing number of 
infrastructure developers 
are choosing to divest their 
operational projects to release 
locked-in capital and fund 
future developments. This is 
creating a robust supply chain 
of proven, income-generating 
assets with limited execution 
risks. For InvITs, such 
assets present an attractive 
opportunity to achieve steady 
growth and deliver consistent 
returns over the long-term.
Amid shifting market conditions, 
investors are gravitating toward 
vehicles that combine steady 
performance with strong 
governance and predictable 
income. InvITs have emerged 
as a preferred choice, providing 
exposure to the infrastructure 
sector through regulated 
infrastructure cash flows.
  Capital Infra Trust has 
secured visibility on 
17 Right of First Offer 
(ROFO) HAM assets.
  The Trust acts as a ready 
vehicle to absorb assets 
efficiently, enabling capital 
unlock for developers and 
yield visibility for investors.
  In FY25, the Trust delivered 
a healthy cash distribution of 
H23.89 per unit. For FY26, 
distributions are projected 
at H14.61 per unit, supported 
by assured annuity inflows 
from NHAI-backed projects.
  The structure also benefits 
from built-in tax exemptions, 
with dividend exemptions 
applicable to select assets.

REGULATORY MOMENTUM AND POLICY 
CONTINUITY IN ROADS SECTOR
To benefit from the positive 
momentum in the infrastructure 
space, InvITs need more than 
favourable market conditions. 
Their ability to scale effectively 
depends on reliable funding 
channels, robust governance 
frameworks and operational 
discipline.
  The Trust holds the credit 
quality ratings of AAA/
Stable from both CRISIL 
and CARE.
  Looking ahead, the platform 
aims to expand its asset 
base to USD 5 billion by 
2030, supported by a strong 
governance framework, 
structured asset pipeline and 
disciplined growth strategy.
Continued regulatory support 
for the HAM model and InvIT 
framework is strengthening 
confidence across the 
infrastructure value chain, 
ensuring smoother asset 
transactions, improving 
investor security and minimising 
uncertainties related to 
counterparties and contractual 
obligations.
  All operational projects 
are supported by NHAI, 
providing the security of 
a government-backed 
revenue framework.
  Each project operates 
under established 
Concession Agreements 
and escrow structures.
  The Project Management 
Agreement (PMA) model 
guarantees dedicated 
operational management 
for a fixed five-year period, 
insulating performance 
from fluctuations in 
operating costs.

CSR Initiatives
Caring Beyond 
Boundaries
Guided by compassion and a deep sense of responsibility, we  advanced 
initiatives to promote animal welfare through the establishment of  
shelters, support for veterinary care and sterilisation programmes, 
awareness campaigns on responsible pet care and collaborations with 
Gaushalas engaged in rescuing and rehabilitating injured or abandoned 
animals.
Through these efforts, we strive to nurture 
a more compassionate world where every 
living being is valued, treated with dignity 
and cared for with respect.
Driven by the intent to make highways 
safer for all beings, NHAI in collaboration 
with our sponsor launched a pioneering 
initiative to address stray cattle-related 
incidents through the establishment of 
purpose-built shelters. Implemented through 
our SPVs GKNHPL and GRSHPL, the 
programme focuses on developing and 
maintaining these shelters across vital 
stretches. Supported by animal care and 
monitoring measures, the initiative reflects 
a deep commitment to road safety and 
humane stray animal management, setting 
a benchmark for infrastructure built with 
conscience.

Valuation Summary
In accordance with the terms of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014 Mr. 
S. Sundararaman (“Registered Valuer” or “RV”), holding IBBI registration number IBBI/RV/06/2018/10238 as appointed as the Valuer 
to undertake fair valuation of the project SPVs.
Assets Valued: The financial assets under consideration are valued at Enterprise Value. 
Sr. No. Name of the SPV (HAM)
1. Gawar Narnaul Highway Private Limited (GNHPL) 
2. Gawar Khajuwala Bap Highway Private Limited (GKBHPL)
3. Hardiya Hasanpur Highway Private Limited (HHHPL) 
4. Gawar Rohna Jhajjar Highway Private Limited (GRJHPL)
5. Gawar Kiratpur Nerchowk Highway Private Limited (GKNHPL)

7. Dewas Ujjain Highway Private Limited (DUHPL)
8. Gawar Bangalore Highways Private Limited (GBHPL)
9. Gawar Nainital Highways Private Limited (GNHPL II) 
The RV has arrived at the Enterprise Value (“EV”) of the SPVs. Enterprise Value is described as the total value of the equity in a 
business plus the value of its debt and debt related liabilities, minus any Cash and Cash Equivalents to meet those liabilities. 
Further, Adjusted Enterprise Value of the SPVs is derived as the EV as defined above plus Cash and Cash Equivalents of the SPVs 
as at the valuation date. 
Summary of Valuation 
Fair enterprise value of each of the SPVs was on a standalone basis by using the Discounted Cash Flow ( “DCF”) method under the 
income approach. 
The discount rate applied for the respective SPVs in this valuation exercise is derived from the Weighted Average Cost of Capital 
(WACC) for each SPV. Since all SPVs under consideration have implemented projects under the HAM model, the operating rights 
of the underlying assets will revert to the appointing authority upon expiry of the concession period. At the end of the concession 
period, both the operating rights and the obligation to maintain the roads will transfer back to the government entity that granted the 
concession. Accordingly, no terminal value has been considered in respect of cash flows beyond the concession period. 
Based on the methodology and assumptions discussed further, RV has arrived at the fair enterprise value of the SPVs as on the 
Valuation Date:

Furthermore, this valuation exercise is based on the projected financial performance of the assets and incorporates assumptions 
regarding future credit risk, cost of debt, and other factors that reflect reasonable expectations as of the valuation date. However, such 
information, estimates, or opinions are not intended as predictions or assurances that any specific level of income, profit, event, or 
transaction will occur. Actual results during the period covered by the prospective financial analysis may differ from these estimates, and 
such variations could be material. Accordingly, a quantitative sensitivity analysis is considered on the following unobservable inputs:

We have divided risks into the below categories and sub-categories which form the key risk classifications:
Half Yearly Report 2025 - 26 43
Corporate Overview01 Statutory Reports02 Financial Statements03
Risks Details
Revenue All Initial Portfolio Assets operate under hybrid annuity contracts, with NHAI paying a fixed 
biannual amount plus interest as per concession agreements. Any reduction or delay in these 
annuity payments may negatively impact the Trust’s distributions.
The InvIT is a newly settled trust and does not have an established operating history, which 
will make it difficult to accurately assess our future growth prospects.
Regulatory, legal, and contractual 
non-compliance
Non-compliance with regulatory, legal, or contractual obligations may result in financial losses 
and legal disputes, adversely affecting the InvIT’s operations and reputation.
Asset valuation and due diligence 
Risk
Incorrect valuation of acquired assets, errors in revenue forecasts, and unforeseen liabilities 
arising from insufficient due diligence may cause financial losses and misstate asset values, 
impacting InvIT’s financial health and stability. and legal disputes, adversely affecting the 
InvIT’s operations and reputation.
People Risk People-related risks such as inadequate succession planning, insufficient employee due 
diligence, and health and safety lapses may lead to operational disruptions, financial losses, 
and reputational damage, impacting InvIT’s performance and stability.
We will depend on certain directors and key employees of the Investment Manager, the 
Project Manager and the Project SPVs, and such entities may be unable to retain such 
personnel or to replace them with similarly qualified personnel, which could have a material, 
adverse effect on the business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and 
prospects of the InvIT and the Project SPVs.
Financial and regulatory 
compliance Risk
Fluctuations in interest rates and non-compliance with SEBI regulations regarding leverage 
rate limits may result in financial losses, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage, 
affecting InvIT’s financial stability and regulatory standing.
Maintenance Risk If we fail to maintain the roads pursuant to and as per the relevant contractual requirements, 
we may be subject to penalties or even termination of our contracts, which may have a 
material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations 
and cash flows.
If any of our InvIT Assets are terminated prematurely, we may not receive payments due to us 
which may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition. 
Refinancing Risk We may face limitations and risks associated with debt financing, refinancing and restrictions 
on investment, which may adversely affect our operations and our ability to make distributions 
to Unitholders.
Valuation Risk The Valuation Report does not assess the commercial viability of the Trust or predict unit 
prices or financial condition. The stated valuations may not represent the actual value of the 
Project SPV’s assets.
Interpretation Risk The interpretation and enforcement of the regulatory framework governing infrastructure 
investment trusts in India is untested and is still evolving, which may have an adverse 
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make 
distributions to Unitholders.
Taxation and Policy Change Risk 	 Amendments in taxation laws or withdrawal of InvIT-related exemptions could affect net 
returns to Unitholders.

Financial 
Statements
Independent Auditor’s Review Report on Unaudited Consolidated Quarterly and Half Yearly Financial 
Results of Capital Infra Trust (formerly known as National Infrastructure Trust) (“the Trust”) pursuant to 
the Regulation 23 of the SEBI ((Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014 (as amended) and 
SEBI Master Circular SEBI/HO/DDHS-PoD-2/P/CIR/2025/102 dated 11 July 2025
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of 
unaudited consolidated financial results (‘the Statement’) 
of Capital Infra Trust  (formerly known as ‘National 
Infrastructure Trust’) (“the Trust”) and its subsidiaries 
(the Trust and its subsidiaries together referred to as ‘the 
Group’) (refer Annexure 1 for the list of subsidiaries included 
in the Statement) for the quarter and half year ended 30 
September 2025, being submitted by Gawar Investment 
Manager Private Limited (‘the Investment Manager of the 
Trust’) pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 23 of 
the SEBI (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations, 
2014 (as amended) (hereinafter referred to as ‘the SEBI 
Regulations’) read with the SEBI Master Circular SEBI/HO/
DDHS-PoD-2/P/CIR/2025/102 dated 11 July 2025 (‘SEBI 
Master Circular’).
2. The Statement, which is the responsibility of the Investment 
Manager of the Trust and approved by the Board of 
Directors of the Investment Manager of the Trust, has 
been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting 
Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting (‘Ind AS 34’), 
and / or any addendum thereto as defined in rule 2(1)(a) 
of Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 
and other accounting principles generally accepted in India 
and is in compliance with the presentation and disclosure 
requirements of Regulation 23 of the SEBI Regulations 
read with the SEBI Master Circular. Our responsibility is to 
express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review.
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance 
with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410, 
Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by 
the Independent Auditor of the Entity, issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the ‘ICAI’). A 
review of interim financial information consists of making 
inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial 
and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other 
review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope 
than an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards 
on Auditing issued by the ICAI, and consequently, does 
not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become 
aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an 
audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
 We also performed procedures in accordance with 
Regulation 13(2)(e) of the SEBI Regulations, to the 
extent applicable.
4. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed 
as stated in paragraph 3 above, nothing has come to our 
attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying 
Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition 
and measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34 and 
/ or any addendum thereto as defined in rule 2(1)(a) of 
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 
and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed 
in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 23 of 
the SEBI Regulations read with the SEBI Master Circular 
including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it 
contains any material misstatement.
5. We did not review the unaudited financial information of 
5 subsidiaries included in the Statement, whose financial 
information reflects total assets of H18,629.76 as at 30 
September 2025, and total revenues of H1,047.22 and  
H1,944.57, total net profit /(loss) after tax of H124.71 and  
H(229.52), total comprehensive income/(loss) of H124.71 and  
H(229.52), for the quarter and half year ended on 30 September 
2025, respectively, and cash flows (net) of H52.96 for the period 
ended 30 September 2025, as considered in the Statement. 
These unaudited financial information have been reviewed by 
other auditors whose review reports have been furnished to us 
by the Investment Manager of the Trust, and our conclusion 
in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included 
in respect of these subsidiaries is based solely on the review 
reports of such other auditors and the procedures performed 
by us as stated in paragraph 3 above. Our conclusion is not 
modified in respect of this matter with respect to our reliance on 
the work done by and the reports of the other auditors.
6. The Statement includes the consolidated financial results 
of the Group as at and for the quarter and half year ended 
30 September 2024 as comparative financial information, 
which is based on the financial information of the Group 
approved by the Board of Directors of Investment Manager 
of the Trust, which has not been subject to audit or review. 
Our conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter.

purpose of determining distributions at Trust level for the quarter ended 30 June 2025.
2 As per revised NDCF framework, minimum up to 90% of the NDCF should be distributed by the SPV to the Trust. Accordingly, 
amount set aside by SPV for up to 10% of NDCF is in-line with the framework notified under SEBI Master Circular.
3 The reserve is primarily earmarked to cover statutory dues (net of any reversals) payable by the SPV as of 30 September 2025,

and the external lender, to which the Project SPVs are parties , for borrowings undertaken by Capital Infra Trust.
4 Pursuant to the distribution declared for the financial year ended 31 March 2025, an amount was to be distributed by the SPV to 
the Trust. As of 30 September 2025, out of the same certain amount remains outstanding. The pending balance is expected to 
be paid during the subsequent reporting period.
5 Amount reflected in opening cash and bank balance (including FDR) represents surplus available in the SPV on on 14 January

computation during the previous period ended 31 March 2025.
6 During the previous year ended 31 March 2025, the Trust has extended loans to the SPV for repayment of external debt. Such

Notes:
1 Amount reflected in opening cash and bank balance (including FDR) represents surplus available in the SPV on on 14 January 
2025 (acquisition date) pursuant to acquisition of such SPV by the Trust and hence has been seperately disclosed in the NDCF 
computation during the previous period ended 31 March 2025.
2 During the previous year ended 31 March 2025, the Trust has extended loans to the SPV for repayment of external debt. Such 
utilisation is in the nature of refinancing and has been excluded in above computation of NDCF.
3 As per revised NDCF framework, minimum up to 90% of the NDCF should be distributed by the SPV to the Trust. Accordingly, 
amount set aside by SPV for up to 10% of NDCF is in-line with the framework notified under SEBI Master Circular
4 The reserve set aside primarily covers the payment of statutory dues by the SPV as of 30 September 2025, along with reserve 
set aside towards payment of COS expenses incurred to the Contractor as per terms of Contractual agreement. (Net of reversal 
of provision utilised in previous period).

books of accounts. Subsequently, it has been determined that the proposed Claim Settlement Agreement will not be executed. In 
view of this development, and considering that no enforceable obligation exists, the provision is no longer considered necessary. 
Accordingly, the provision amounting to ₹33.41 million has been written back during the current quarter.
8 The Group activities comprise of owning and investing in Infrastructure assets to generate cash flows for distribution to unitholders.

of Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 
and other accounting principles generally accepted in India 
and is in compliance with the presentation and disclosure 
requirements of Regulation 23 of the SEBI Regulations 
read with the SEBI Master Circular. Our responsibility is to 
express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review.
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance 
with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410, 
Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by 
the Independent Auditor of the Entity, issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the ‘ICAI’). A 
review of interim financial information consists of making 
inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial 
and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other 
review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope 
than an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards 
on Auditing issued by the ICAI, and consequently, does 
not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become 
aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an 
audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
4. Based on our review conducted as above , nothing has 
come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 
accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the 
recognition and measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 
34, and / or any addendum thereto as defined in rule 2(1)(a) 
of Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 
and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed 
in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 23 of 
the SEBI Regulations read with the SEBI Master Circular, 
including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it 
contains any material misstatement.
5. The Statement includes the standalone financial results of 
the Trust as and for the quarter and half year ended 30 
September 2024 as comparative financial information, 
which is based on the financial information of the Trust 
approved by the Board of Directors of Investment Manager 
of the Trust, which has not been subjected to audit or review. 
Our conclusion is not modified in respect to this matter.

amount from certain SPV's which remains outstanding as of 30 September 2025. The remaining balance is expected to be 
collected in the subsequent reporting period.

Highway Private Limited, Gawar Nainital Highways Private Limited, and Hardiya Hasanpur Highway Private Limited. During 
the previous quarter, six remaining SPVs reported negative Net Distributable Cash Flow (NDCF). Consequently, no distribution

Code, 1860. Our Sponsor (“Plaintiff”) filed a

others (“Defendant”). The name of the Sponsor 
has been erroneously published on the official 
website of the Balachaur District Court, whereas 
it is not mentioned in the petition or in any other 
court order. The matter is currently pending.
  3. Gawar Construction Limited (GCL) was 
undertaking a project for the “development of 
a Six-Lane Access Controlled Highway in the 
Uttar Pradesh portion of the Delhi–Saharanpur 
Highway from Akshardham Junction to UP”. 
BSES Yamuna Power Limited (“Plaintiff”) filed a 
complaint before the Karkardooma District Court 
against GCL (“Defendant”), alleging that during 
the shifting of BSES lines from the Right of Way

violation of the Central Electrical Authority 
Regulations, 2010. Accordingly, the Plaintiff has 
initiated criminal proceedings against GCL under

2003. The matter is currently pending before the

million was transferred to the Petitioner’s firm, 
with deductions by NHAI. Despite reporting 
the issue to the police, no FIR was registered. 
The Petitioner has therefore sought the Court’s

to the Sponsor so far.

* Enterprise Value (“V”) is described as the total value of the equity in a business plus the value of its debt and debt related 
liabilities, minus any Cash and Cash quivalents to meet those liabilities.  
 urther, on the request of the Investment Manager, I have calculated Ad4usted nterprise *alue of the S&*s which is 
derived as the * as defined above plus Cash and Cash equivalents of the S&*s as at the *aluation Date.
