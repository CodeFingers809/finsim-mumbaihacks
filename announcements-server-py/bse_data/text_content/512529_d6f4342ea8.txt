Press Release 
SeQuent Scientiﬁc and Viyash Lifesciences Receive NCLT Approval for Transformational 
Merger 
• Combined Strengths Poised to Create a Global Animal Health Powerhouse 
• Q2 FY25–26: Combined Sales Up 16%, EBITDA Surges 76%, underscoring the 
operational and strategic synergies emerging from the merger 
Mumbai, 18 November 2025 : SeQuent Scientiﬁc Ltd. (“SeQuent”), a leading player in the global 
Animal Health industry, and Viyash Lifesciences Private Limited (“Viyash”), an integrated global 
pharmaceutical company, announced today that the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has 
allowed the petition and approved the Scheme of merger between SeQuent and the Viyash group 
of companies. The NCLT approval marks the beginning of a new chapter for the combined entity, 
and represents a fundamental transformation to leapfrog into the next orbit of the global animal 
health market. The combined ﬁnancial performance of the companies with ag gregate H1FY26 
revenues of INR 16.5bn and aggregate H1FY26 EBITDA of INR 3.2bn, with a Net Debt to EBITDA 
ratio of 0.7x, represents signiﬁcant scale as the largest animal health player from India. 
As highlighted earlier, the combined entity is aligned to capitalise on two major long-term industry 
opportunities: 
1. Global, fast -growing Companion (Pet) Animal Health segment – The inherent growth in the 
market provides a large opportunity, driven by increased pet adoption and emerging treatments 
for Bone & Joint disease, Dermatitis, Diabetes, Cardiology and Oncology , similar to human 
pharmaceutical applications. 
2. Genericization of Animal Health, which lags signiﬁcantly behind Human Health – This provides 
a substantial opportunity for the combined company to leverage its technical strengths in APIs 
and Formulations. In addition, the advanced capabilities in R&D would help strengthen its fast -
growing CDMO business. 
This merger not only delivers the necessary scale and capabilities for accelerating organic growth 
in the Animal Health market, but also provides ﬁnancial resilience, stability, and management 
bandwidth to rejuvenate SeQuent’s inorganic growth engine. 
Dr. Haribabu Bodepudi, Founder and CEO, Viyash, said,  “This merger creates the platform to 
deliver world-class solutions for our customers. With our strengths in R&D, custom development 
capabilities, manufacturing capacities, and a streamlined supply chain, we would emerge as an 
innovative and reliable partner for our customers across the world. Over the last few months, we 
have developed a comprehensive plan for integration which leverages synergies for growth and 
capability. The momentum reﬂected in our recent results is only the beginning” 
Commenting on the merger, Mr. Rajaram Narayanan, Managing Director and CEO of SeQuent, 
said, “We are pleased to receive the approval from the Hon’ble NCLT, marking the start of a 
transformative journey for the combined entity. There are signiﬁcant opportunities to provide 
relevant, differentiated and quality care for animals. With this merger, the Company will be 
uniquely positioned to  build a world -class business and deliver on the requirements of pet 
owners, farmers and animal health professionals.  Together, we are building a company that will 
set new benchmarks in quality, innovation, and customer trust.”
