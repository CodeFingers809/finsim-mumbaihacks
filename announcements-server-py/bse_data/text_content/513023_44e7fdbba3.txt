Explanatory Statement pursuant to Section 102(1) of the Companies Act 2013, read with Rule 15(3) of the 
Companies (Meetings of Board and its Powers) Rules, 2014.  
 
Background: 
 
Nava Limited (“the Company”) holds 100% of the equity share capital of Nava Global Pte. Ltd. , Singapore 
(“NGPL”). NGPL serves as the Company’s global investment arm and has been overseeing the Group’s 
international businesses. 
 
Mr. Ashwin Devineni, presently the Managing Director of the Company as well as of NGPL and a Key Managerial 
Person of the Company, has been instrumental in driving the Company’s growth and international expansion. 
 
Mr. Ashwin Devineni resigned from the position of Managing Director in order to devote his attention on strategic 
oversight on international businesses instead of day -to-day management of NGPL but continued as it’s Director.  
In view of the Company’s evolving global footprint and with a view to aligning leadership responsibilities with its 
long-term strategic direction, the Board of Directors of NGPL considered and approved the re-designation of Mr. 
Ashwin Devineni as “Director & Vice Chairman” of NGPL effective November 8, 2025, on the same terms and 
conditions of appointment, including remuneration , subjec t to the approvals from the Board of Directors and 
Shareholders of the Company (Nava Ltd.). 
 
Consequently, Mr. Ashwin Devineni shall continue to serve as a Director on the Board of NGPL and assumes the 
executive role of Vice Chairman. 
 
Rationale for Re-designation: 
 
The re -designation reflects a transition from operational involvement to a strategic oversight and governance -
oriented role, allowing Mr. Ashwin Devineni to: 
 
• Provide long-term strategic guidance and direction to the management of NGPL. 
• Oversee governance, policy formulation, and value creation for the subsidiary. 
• Guide and support the senior leadership team, comprising the acting CEO & CFO and COO, who will 
     continue to handle day-to-day responsibilities. 
 
This change is consistent with the Company’s objective of strengthening its global governance framework and 
aligning the management hierarchy with future growth and succession planning. 
 
Terms of Appointment: 
 
• The re-designation does not involve any change in the existing terms of appointment, position and  
     remuneration of Mr. Ashwin Devineni, excepting the change of responsibility as stated above. 
• The re-designation will be effective from November 8, 2025. 
• Mr. Ashwin Devineni shall continue to serve as a member of the Board of NGPL. 
 
In accordance with the provisions of Section 188(1) of the Companies Act, 2013 and Rule 15 of the Companies 
(Meetings of Board and its Powers) Rules, 2014 , any appointment to any office or place of profit in a subsidiary 
company of a director, relative of a director, or key managerial person of the Company constitutes a related party 
transaction. 
 
Since Mr. Ashwin Devineni is a related party within the meaning of Section 2(76) of the Act and holds a managerial 
position in the Company, his re-designation in the wholly owned subsidiary falls under the ambit of Section 188.
