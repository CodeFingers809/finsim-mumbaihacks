Escorts Kubota Limited Introduces Third-
Generation Ride-On Rice Transplanters in India 
 
Escorts Kubota Limited (EKL), one of India’s leading engineering conglomerates in the 
agricultural and construction equipment space, has introduced its third-generation Ride-On Rice 
Transplanters – KA6 and KA8 under Kubota Brand. Engineered in Japan, the new models combine 
advanced technology with on-field practicality to deliver higher productivity, operator comfort 
and planting precision. The models have been introduced across 7 states - Tamil Nadu, Punjab, 
Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Telangana, where demand for 
mechanized paddy solutions is rising. 
The KA6 and KA8 transplanters are powered by Kubota’s fuel-efficient engines that deliver 21 & 
24 horsepower, ensuring dependable performance even in tough field conditions. Both models 
come with a smart turning system for smoother handling and an automatic lift function that 
makes cornering easier. The Multifunction control lever allows effortless operation, while the 
horizontal control mechanism helps maintain uniform planting depth. The redesigned planting 
claws significantly reduces missed planting, and ensure seedlings are placed evenly, and 
improved New Seedling picking guide allows on high accuracy and planting will improve the crop 
growth and yield consistency. 
Operator comfort has also been thoughtfully improved. The machines feature a wider platform 
for easier movement, an ergonomic layout for reduced fatigue, and LED lights that make farming 
easier even in the after-sunset hours. The lighter planting section and longer wheelbase enhance 
balance and stability, allowing to cross the big ridges easily and making the transplanters 
suitable for extended work in deep wet field conditions.  
Speaking about the launch, Mr. Bharat Madan, Chief Financial Officer & Wholetime Director, 
said, “India’s farmers have long carried the responsibility of feeding the nation, often through 
arduous work in challenging conditions. At Escorts Kubota Limited, we view mechanization as a 
national mission to empower farmers, enhance their dignity, and make agriculture more efficient 
and sustainable. The new KA Series rice transplanters mark a significant milestone in this 
journey, transforming a labour-intensive process with precision, comfort, and innovation. By 
blending global technology with local insights, we continue to lead the mechanization movement 
in India—advancing productivity, reliability, and prosperity for farmers across the country.” 
Mr. Rajan Chugh, Chief Officer, Agri Solutions Business Division, added, “The KA6 and KA8 
transplanters embody our continuous commitment to innovation and farmer-centric design. 
Every feature has been engineered to address real challenges in paddy fields, from labour 
shortage to long working hours, and to deliver consistent performance season after season. With 
their higher horsepower, smart turning capability and ergonomic layout, these machines make 
rice transplanting faster, uniform and more profitable for the modern farmer.”
