Independent Auditor's Limited Review Report on Unaudited Standalone Financial Results for the 
Quarter and Half Year ended September 30, 2025, of the Company pursuant to the Regulation 33 of 
the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (the 
"Listing Regulations") 
To 
The Board of Directors, 
Panacea Biotec Limited 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited standalone financial results of Panacea 
Biotec Limited (the 'Company') for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025 (hereinafter 
referred to as "Statement"). being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 
33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (the 
"Listing Regulations"). 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and approved by the 
Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement 
principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" ("IND AS 34"), 
prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 as amended, read with relevant rules issued 
thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and is in compliance with the 
presentation and disclosure requirements of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. Our responsibility 
is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements 
(SRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity", 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and 
perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the statement is free of material 
misstatement. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons 
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A 
review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing 
specified under Section 143 (10) of the Companies Act, 2013 and consequently does not enable us to 
obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an 
audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
