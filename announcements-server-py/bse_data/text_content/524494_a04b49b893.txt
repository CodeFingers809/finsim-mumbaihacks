in this quarter has grown by around 11%, and urolog y business was also around 11%. This is 
in spite of -- there is an impact in the month of September becaus e that growth was very, very 
low for us. 
Saion Mukherjee: So, sir, what was the impact? And what is your guid ance for the full year for India growth 
now? 
A.K. Jain: Let's say, overall, our guidance was 
Saion Mukherjee: Okay. And the other question I would like to unders tand from you is on Unichem. So if you 
can just take us through what we should expect? You  talked about synergies before, part is 
realized, part will be. So if you can talk about th e time lines and the quantum there? And what 
is your guidance on EBITDA margin for Unichem this year or next year, please? 
A.K. Jain: Let's say, as far as Unichem is concerned, let's sa y, we were talking a

dossiers are filed in European market and other mar kets, that filing has started. So that work 
and after this filing, probably 
And then we'll start extending their product busine sses to the other markets. So that work is 
going on. 
 As far as qualifying whatever API they are buying from outside and there the Ipca is one 
major source. That qualification applications are a lready say data are generated and fed with 
regulatory authorities once, let's say, that's clea r. So far, no sourcing has started from Ipca. So 
once that approvals come, so that there is some 
kind of delay may happen. 
 But thereafter, probably from next financial year, some of our major APIs, we should start 
supplying to them after the regulatory approvals ar e there. So that's the overall journey, which 
is cu rrently happening. 
 As far as Unichem margins are concerned, first quar ter was largely impacted because of some 
restructuring, which has happened in Europe because  one of their facility manufacturing 
facilities which was there in Europe, there we had hands 
that facility. That business

Let's say, as far as Unichem is concerned, let's sa y, we were talking a bout whatever cost 
reductions we need to work to do as far as their sh ipping, logistics and that was already done. 
Their energy cost reductions was already done. In last financial year itself, that was done. 
As far as the business issues are concerned, nu mber one was that we should extend their 
product to the various markets. So that work has st arted. And I think around 12 product 
dossiers are filed in European market and other mar kets, that filing has started. So that work 
and after this filing, probably approval may take around 1 year to 1.5 years. That' s the time.

once that approvals come, so that there is some -- may be around six months to nine m

As far as Unichem margins are concerned, first quar ter was largely impacted because of some 
restructuring, which has happened in Europe because  one of their facility manufacturing 
facilities which was there in Europe, there we had hands hake with people, and we were closing 
that facility. That business  is transferred to their Baddi. 
So overall, they were incurring around EUR3.5 million to EUR 4 million every year, the 
expenditure. So that expenditure will be cut now. A nd that manufacturin g and all the sources 
and all approvals has received. And I think the nor mal business has already started from their

 So more improvements will start coming in once, let 's say, dossier filing, which 
and there their approvals start coming in from the various markets and we start extending their

 So, I think overall, their business margins are exp ected 
the second quarter, but larger improvement may take  place only after the various approvals, 
what we are expecting.

were there. And I think that cost has settled their first quarter account.  
On European Union kind of penalties and all that pa yments were made. And I think since euro

Second quarter was normal.  
They had a good business growth in U.S. around 12% , and their European business has also 
done well. And therefore, I think over INR60 crores kind of EBITDA margins they have, 
which is around 1 1% or so of the second quarter. 
So more improvements will start coming in once, let 's say, dossier filing, which 
and there their approvals start coming in from the various markets and we start extending their 
product to the other markets. So that advantage will still going to take some more time. 
So, I think overall, their business margins are exp ected to remain around what is in line with 
the second quarter, but larger improvement may take  place only after the various approvals, 
what we are expecting.  
And then, sir, we could get to what, 15%, 20% kind of levels? What would be after all 
approvals and benefits?  
The business also has to mature because business st arts, so it will take time. So, let's say, I 
would say it may -- for that margins to go up, it may be around 1.5 to 2 years. 
stion is from th e line of Aanchal from Lotus Wealth. 
Yes. So I just wanted some clarity around the syner gies from Unichem. So we see that the 
R&D has increased in this quarter. But say, going ahead, if, for example, the R&D from Ipca is 
200 crores, whil e the R&D from Unichem is around INR 100 crores. This at the 
consol level comes to around INR 300 crores, correct? So going ahead in the next yea r, can we 
say that this expense from INR300 crores can come to around INR 150 crores or 
No, that expenditure reduction will not happen beca use Unichem has to do a lot of work in 
terms of, let's say, extending their dossier to the  various markets. And a lot of places, there are 
repeat bioequivalent study need to be done for fili ng in other mar kets like Australia, New 
Zealand, Canada, all those markets, Europe filing a nd all -- and so those bioequivalent studies 
and all are required, then somewhere trade dress ne eds to be matched because somewhere 
colors of the tablet may be different and other size shapes are different. 
So a lot of those kind of work or incremental work need to be done in order to align the 
product portfolio and getting those kind of approva ls. So, in fact, those expenditures are going 
to remain. What we have eliminated is that  both the teams will not work on a common product. 
So there will be no duplication. But as far as work  is concerned, in fact, that cost has already

Yes. So I just wanted some clarity around the syner gies from Unichem. So we see that the

100 crores. This at the 
300 crores, correct? So going ahead in the next yea r, can we

No, that expenditure reduction will not happen beca use Unichem has to do a lot of work in

Okay, sir. And also around the ANDA synergies. So say, if Unichem already has an approved

Let's say, Unichem is marketing all Ipca products. So Unichem, if it is producing, they have

happen that future development, it will all depend on whether Unichem -- if Unichem has API,
chem will develop that product. 
If Ipca has API, Ipca will develop the product. There will not be a common product

I think overall, the R&D spend in the current financial year is going to remain around 4% of

as far as the manufacturing 
oncerned, let's say, your fuel cost is down. My power cost has gone up by just 
   
1% because we have a lot of renewal power, power pr oject installation, so that savings are

 And overall other costs, by and large, except the t esting cost, which has mov

A.K. Jain: Let's say, this year also, we have expanded the fie

that division right now, last year, it has started.  It is still incurring the losses. So in time to 
come, that productivity will also build up. 
 So we have almost around 7,000 people and 
around 400 to 500 people annually can be added. But beyond that number addition is not going 
to be there in next two, three years' time. 
Kunal: Got it, sir. That is helpful. And just one more, if  you don't min

 But since our product mix is improving, let's say, my chronic

Marketing cost has moved up by almost around 6% to 7% in this quarter.  
Got it, sir. And is it -- are you kind of have stopped expanding t he sales force because last 
couple of years expanding. So that was also kind of  hitting your P&L. Now it's more of a 
state growth number. Is that what we should assume going forward too? 
Let's say, this year also, we have expanded the fie ld force. And overall, if you look, we have 
almost around 7,000 now medical reps. So two more cardiac divisions was added in the current 
financial year. And in time to come, we will add on e more division on cosmetic dermatology 
so some kind of those  expenditures were there is likely to be there. 
And also one division was added about one division named Flexicare was added to extend our 
equity on, let's say, on pain management because we  are very strong with orthos and we have 
leadership there. But we  have only pain products. So we have launched a range of products. So 
that division right now, last year, it has started.  It is still incurring the losses. So in time to 
come, that productivity will also build up.  
So we have almost around 7,000 people and  now additions are not going to be much, maybe 
around 400 to 500 people annually can be added. But beyond that number addition is not going 
to be there in next two, three years' time.  
Got it, sir. That is helpful. And just one more, if  you don't min d. On the margin front. So, in 
this quarter, the growth was driven by AI and the s ubsidiaries -- the top line growth that is, 
which I assume are lower gross margin businesses, w hile your Indian branded was slightly 
softer. Despite that, the gross margin is  very robust. So I just want to understand how you have 
been managed to have like 69%, 70% gross margin? 
Let's say, in the -- if you look at the current quarter numbers, the ove rall, let's say, top line has 
moved up by around 7%. But at the same  time, the material cost is down by almost around 3%  
to 4% kind of reduction there in material cost. So what we are finding that there is no increase 
cost as such, procurement cost.  
But since our product mix is improving, let's say, my chronic  product mix is improving, my 
other product mix is improving, where we have highe r margins. So that is resulting in the 
overall margin. And also on the API side, certain b usinesses have started happening, which are 
also at a higher margin level.  
margin has also improved, and that has resulted in almost around EBITDA margin 
improvement in -- in spite of lower growth in the quarter, we have al most around 2.57% 
improvement in the stand -alone EBITDA margin from 22.89% to almost around 25.46%.

to 4% kind of reduction there in material cost. So what we are finding that there is no increase

other product mix is improving, where we have highe r margins. So that is resulting in the 
overall margin. And also on the API side, certain b usinesses have started happening, which are

in spite of lower growth in the quarter, we have al most around 2.57%

 And in consolidated margin for the quarter has also improv ed to around 21.68% from 19.1%. 
By and large, it's largely driven by Ipca margins h ere. And that trend will continue. The trend

erosion, what is the current situation? And how do you

Management: Actually, during our Q1 con call, we had said Unich em has lost market share in certain of its 
products. That is also because of the lower prices for that product and increase in the 
competition . At the same time, they have also gained market sh are in a few other products, but 
that convert into business will take some time. 
 So going forward, we are confident two, three new p roducts will also get added each year and

Management: That is correct, yes. This year, the 
certain market share in two of their major products. That is the reason, nothing else. 
Dharmil Shah: And what was the reason for losing the market share? Is it purely based on price? 
Management: It was that the competition increased and people qu oted lower prices and they took a certain 
market share.  
Dharmil Shah: Understood. So is it more like a tendering business for us where each year the tenders.

And we have seen some price appreciation there that  has been helpi ng people. But despite 
Europe being one of the largest market for us, the growth has not been in any manner

No, Mr. Jain has already explained, it is because of one single pro duct. Excluding that product, 
the sales in all other products are good. And the p roducts where sales were good were having 
better margins. So margin did not got impacted. Onl y that particular product, ex that product,

 So his assistance would be available to us because he's already consulting a large number of 
companies in India, China and Europe also on 
very experienced person. 
 So -- and -- on that particular product, he will also, let's say , his focus more and more is likely 
to be the government business and other. We will al so do some private business. And 
simultaneously, we will also have 
both the facilities will have an approval. That's th 
 And on that, we will also get the market share in U .S. So from whatever 
almost around 25% is the market share, which will c ome to us on that particular. So that's the 
broad understanding we have with the party. 
Rajakumar: Okay. And no monetization opportunity in this financial year with respect to the deal?

compared to other companies, our filings are, by and large, likely to remain low only, 
but it all depends on our API capacity because ulti mately, unless you have API, you cannot be 
term player because you all depend on the price giv en by other parties and that limits 
your ability to compete in the m arket and all. So that's the business philosophy an d that 
business philosophy will remain for longer term.  
So, I ask, how many -- so these -- so you would be developing new APIs, right, for this? 
. And so these APIs would be like -- is there a number? I mean, how should 
about the kind of product...  
Current capacity is around five to six APIs we can develop. So it's only those development 
would happen on formulation side. Some API, we can outsource and also file, but it's not 
going to be a significant number. If API is constit uting a very small part of overall product 
cost, then we may outsource or maybe it's a general  type of API with so many products people 
are producing, then  those kind of API we may not take up. So that's the overall thinking. 
The next question is from the line of Raja kumar from RK Invest. 
Sir, the first question is, can you comment on the monetization opportunity with reference to 
ech transfer deal that you did with biosimilars Puerto Rico?  
It's one of the old product and still having very r elevance and U.S. business of government is 
also bigger and the party wanted to take kind of, l et's say, our technology for your drug 
well as the drug product, both.  
So we have milestone -based payment and royalty-based system. At the same time, that party is 
expert on and is filing -- it's a regulatory consultant to so many companies o n biosimilar 
development and all. So c ollaborating with him will also help us in your qua lification of that 
plant from U.S.  FDA and other markets and all. 
So his assistance would be available to us because he's already consulting a large number of 
companies in India, China and Europe also on the biosimilar kind of development and all. So 
very experienced person.  
on that particular product, he will also, let's say , his focus more and more is likely 
to be the government business and other. We will al so do some private business. And 
simultaneously, we will also have -- we will also be participating in clinical trial wit h him and 
both the facilities will have an approval. That's th e kind of working we are doing. 
And on that, we will also get the market share in U .S. So from whatever 
almost around 25% is the market share, which will c ome to us on that particular. So that's the 
broad understanding we have with the party.  
Okay. And no monetization opportunity in this financial year with respect to the deal?

utilize that also. It's not our focus that we keep on transferring those technologies and
monitoring. We will be utilizing those technologies for building up our pipeline.
Rajakumar: Okay. Got it, sir. Sir, and second thi
last quarter, you said your margin will be down by 25 basis points. And now you are telling
with a better Q2 performance, you're upping your margin by 100 basis points. Is that correct
understanding
A.K. Jain: Yes, because the product mix is improving, and that's giving the better margin. So we are
giving that guideline. And around that time, first quarter result of Unichem was not that good.
Their business is also improving. So hit which was there
in third and fourth quarter.
So that is also taken into consideration while giving the margin. So Ipca's margins are
improving. Unichem's performance is also improving as far as EBITDA is concerned
compared to th
quarter. And overall, looking into all that, we are increasing the overall margin guideline.
