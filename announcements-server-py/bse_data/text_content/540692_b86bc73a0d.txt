› Raw Shrimp supply constraint at the beginning of Q2FY26 impacted Shrimp Sales (MT) to some extent. Thereafter, the supply situation
normalized, and sales picked up during the quarter. The share of Ready-to-eat (RTE) in total Shrimp Sales stood at 14% in H1FY26
› Sales to the USA de-grew 10% YoY, mainly due to the tariff led uncertainties, while European Union (EU)** grew 18% YoY in Q2FY26.
› The average Shrimp Realisation in Q2FY26 grew 25% YoY and 7% QoQ to Rs 870 per Kg, while the average Shrimp Purchase Price
remained flat at Rs 321 per Kg

Key Considerations for the Sector
Being an export-oriented 
sector, any slowdown in 
consumption in key 
markets like the USA, EU 
and South-East Asia will 
have an adverse impact on 
India’s shrimp exports 
Demand Slowdown 
Highly susceptible to 
outbreak of diseases, which 
can have a detrimental 
effect on the availability of 
raw material (shrimp)
Disease Related
Global imbalances in 
demand-supply can 
impact pricing. Exchange 
rate fluctuations can 
amplify the volatility
