FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 
AstraZeneca Pharma India Limited and Sun Pharma partner to 
help patients living with Hyperkalaemia in India 
 
Mumbai & Bengaluru, India, November 17, 2025 - AstraZeneca Pharma India Limited 
(‘AstraZeneca’), a leading science -led biopharmaceutical company (BSE : 506820, NSE : 
ASTRAZEN) and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (Reuters: SUN.BO, Bloomberg: 
SUNP IN, NSE: SUNPHARMA, BSE: 524715, “Sun Pharma” and i ncludes its subsidiaries 
and/or associate companies), today announced a second brand partnership for Sodium 
Zirconium Cyclosilicate (SZC) in India. This exclusive agreement is aimed at further 
accelerating availability of SZC, an innovative and highly effe ctive treatment for 
Hyperkalaemia to more patients across India.  
 
Under the agreement, both companies will promote, market & distribute SZC in India under 
different brand names; AstraZeneca will market SZC as Lokelma ® whereas Sun Pharma will 
promote and distribute the therapy as Gimliand ®. AstraZeneca will retain the int ellectual 
property rights to SZC and hold the Marketing Authorisation along with the import license of 
the molecule. 
 
Praveen Rao Akkinepally, Country President & Managing Director AstraZeneca 
Pharma India Limited said, “At AstraZeneca, we aim to transform  care with a focus on 
increasing early screening, diagnosis, and adoption of guideline -directed medical therapy to 
improve patient outcomes. This partnership with Sun Pharma for SZC reaffirms AstraZeneca's 
purpose to deliver innovative, life-changing medicines to patients with Hyperkalaemia across 
India, coupled with building robust pathways to reach patients in need. With this step, we are 
poised to significantly expand the reach of this vital therapy and help address the disease 
burden”. 
 
Kirti Ganorkar, Managing Director, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited said, “We 
are delighted to join hands with AstraZeneca to address the growing challenge of 
Hyperkalaemia in India. The addition of SZC to our portfolio underscores our unwavering 
commitment to improving the care of patients with chronic kidney disease. As India’s largest 
pharmaceutical company and a leader in this therapy area, we remain focused on expanding 
access to innovative treatments that empower healthcare professionals and enhance the quality 
of life for patients”. 
 
Hyperkalaemia is a clinically significant condition that disproportionately affects patients with 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) and those with heart failure (HF) receiving renin –angiotensin–
aldosterone system (RAAS) i nhibitor therapy, which can elevate serum potassium levels  [1,2]. 
Prevalence estimates suggest that Hyperkalaemia occurs in up to 50% of patients with CKD 
and 42% of patients with chronic HF  [3].  To manage or prevent recurrence, RAAS inhibitor 
therapy is often reduced or discontinued, which may compromise cardiorenal outcomes and 
increase mortality risk. [2,4] In India, mortality associated with Hyperkalaemia has been

reported at 22.2% [5]. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) offers a rapid, effective, and 
generally well‑tolerated treatment option for the management of Hyperkalaemia [6–9]. 
 
Sun Pharma is the largest pharmaceutical company in India, with an 8.3% market share [10] and 
ranks No. 1 in prescriptions across 13 different doctor categories  [11]. With a 15,000 -strong 
field force, the company leads in chronic therapies and maintains a strong presence in the acute 
segment.  
 
Building upon AstraZeneca’s ambition to advance s cience, transform care and help manage 
life threatening conditions like Hyperkalaemia, this strategic step is a significant move in 
improving the management of Hyperkalaemia in India; promising enhanced availability to a 
crucial treatment and ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes nationwide.
