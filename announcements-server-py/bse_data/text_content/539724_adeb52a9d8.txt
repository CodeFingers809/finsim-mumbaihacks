Nexus Innovate provides a range of technology and consulting services supported 
by a skilled workforce and a global delivery framework. Over the years, the company 
has gained experience in handling complex and long-term assignments, focusing on 
practical and cost-efficient solutions that meet the operational needs of its clients. 
Its customers include corporates and multinationals across Singapore, the Asia-
Pacific region, and the United States, reflecting the diversity of its project 
engagements. 
 
With its established presence in these key markets and its ongoing adoption of 
relevant technologies, Nexus Innovate is positioned to pursue further growth in ERP, 
SAP, and integrated enterprise technology services. As demand for digital 
transformation continues to rise across the Asia-Pacific region and the US, the 
company’s delivery capabilities, sector experience, and existing client relationships 
offer a steady foundation for future expansion. 
 
Hypersoft’s acquisition of Nexus Innovate Pte. Ltd. and its subsidiary company marks 
a strategic step toward strengthening its international footprint, particularly in 
Singapore and the USA. The integration of Nexus Innovate provides complementary 
IT and consulting strengths that broaden Hypersoft’s service capabilities and support 
the development of a more comprehensive solutions portfolio. 
 
The acquisition of 100% Ordinary Shares of Nexus Innovate Pte. Ltd. enables 
Hypersoft to consolidate its shareholding by purchasing the minority stake held by 
public shareholders other than Mr. Narra Purna Babu. This consolidation is aimed at 
enhancing Hypersoft’s control, improving strategic alignment, and unlocking 
synergy opportunities across the combined operations. 
 
The transaction is expected to result in operational and strategic benefits through 
process alignment, technology consolidation, and optimized resource deployment. 
It will also contribute to long-term growth by leveraging Nexus Innovate’s 
experienced talent pool, established client relationships, and diversified service 
capabilities, thereby strengthening Hypersoft’s global delivery platform and 
supporting its broader expansion objectives. 
 
Following the acquisition, Nexus Innovate Pte. Ltd. will become a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Hypersoft Technologies Limited. Additionally, Nexus Innovate LLC, 
which is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of Nexus Innovate Pte. Ltd., will also 
become a wholly owned step-down subsidiary of Hypersoft Technologies Limited by 
virtue of the share swap.
