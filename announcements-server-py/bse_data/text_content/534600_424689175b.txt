Note 1: As per the outcome of the Company’s Securities Issue and Allotment Committee vide meeting dated 
February 02, 2024, it was taken on record that in objects of the issue, all sub-heads, individually, shall get adjusted 
almost in proportion with the total iss ue proceeds, subject to +/ - 10% deviation, depending upon the future 
circumstances, as the aggregate amount reduced from 810.00 crores to 675.00 crores.  (Source: Outcome of the 
Company’s Securities Issue and Allotment Committee Meeting duly held on February 02, 2024) 
 
Note 2: The Issue Period, which spanned 18 months from the date of allotment, concluded on August 01, 2025. 
During this period, no warrants were converted into equity shares, as the shares consistently traded below the 
exercise price. Consequently, subscribers cho se not to exercise the warrants . Non-exercise of warrant by the 
holders, due to the share price remaining below the warrant exercise price, has resulted in a significant shortfall 
in fund-raising, ultimately impacting the viability and means of finance of the stated object(s).
