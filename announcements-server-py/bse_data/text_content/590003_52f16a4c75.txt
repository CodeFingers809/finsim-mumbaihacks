Press Release 
Karur Vysya Bank joins National Finance Olympiad to Promote Financial 
Literacy in Schools 
 
Karur, 18th November 2025 : Karur Vysya Bank (KVB) has launched a Financial Literacy 
Awareness Program for school students under its CSR pillar, “KVB Vidya,” aligned with the 
CSR theme of Promoting Education. Implemented in partnership with the National Finance 
Olympiad (NFO), the initiative aims to equip young learners with essential financial knowledge 
and skills to help them make informed decisions in the future. 
The program focuses on government and underprivileged school students from Grades 9 to 12, 
covering 210 schools and benefiting over 3,150 students. It features a structured financial 
literacy curriculum supported by physical study materials, alongside both  online and offline 
examinations conducted by NFO to assess learning outcomes. Students will receive certificates 
and medals in recognition of their performance. 
The collaboration commenced in September 2025 and currently functions as a project -based 
partnership for the year 2025. Under this initiative, KVB has funded and coordinated the 
program, while NFO has managed the study materials, examinations, and overall execution. 
KVB will also offer additional financial literacy resources and awareness sessions to 
participating students. 
Shri Ramesh Babu, Managing Director & CEO, Karur Vysya Bank, expressed his enthusiasm, 
saying: “Our partnership with the National Finance Olympiad has helped us introduce essential 
financial concepts to students at a formative age, a crucial step toward strengthening financial 
inclusion. With the support of our 20 divisional offices, we’ve been able to reach more schools 
and create meaningful on -ground impact. This collaboration has enhanced the program’s 
credibility and effectiveness, and we see it as the beginning of a long-term mission to nurture 
financially responsible young citizens. Encouraged by the initiative’s success and the positive 
student response, we look forward to expanding our CSR efforts in financial literacy, 
particularly in schools.” 
Mitul Mehta, Co-founder of the National Finance Olympiad, said: “The urgency to build 
financial literacy among India’s youth has never been greater. Students today are growing up 
in a world where financial decisions start early, yet access to structured money education 
remains limited across the country. Partnerships with institutions like Karur Vysya Bank 
accelerate our mission nationwide, helping us equip every student with practical money skills 
and shaping a financially confident generation for the future.”
