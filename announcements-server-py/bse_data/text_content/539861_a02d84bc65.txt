Subiect: -Explanation for Non-Submission of Financial Results period ended Sept 30, 2025 under Requlation 33 of the SEBI LODR Requlations, 2015 as on March 31, 2025. 
We hereby inform you that the Company is presently undergoing proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 ("iBC"), The Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal ("NCLT"), Mumbai Bench, vide its order dated February 1, 2024, admitted an application filed under Section 7 of the IBC against the Company, thereby initiating the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process ("CIRP"). Pursuant to the said order, the undersigned was appointed as the Interim Resolution Professional ("IRP"). Subsequently, an appeal was preferred before the Hon'ble National Company Law Appellate Tribunal ("NCLAT") in the matter of Bhavesh Gandhi vs. Amluckie Investment Company Ltd., Company Appeal (AT) (Ins.) No. 244 of 2024, challenging the NCLT order dated February 1, 2024, pertaining to initiation of CIRP. During the pendency of the appeal, the Appellant, Mr. Bhavesh Gandhi, obtained a stay on the constitution of the Committee of Creditors ("Co C") of Skil Infrastructure Limited. We further wish to inform you that the Hon'ble NCLAT, Principal Bench, New Delhi, vide its order dated October 15, 2025, vacated the said stay and allowed withdrawal of the appeal. Consequent to the lifting of the interim stay, the CoC has been duly constituted on 27 October 2025, and the Hon'ble NCLT approved the same. The first meeting of committee of creditors was held on 3 November 2025. In the meantime, an application under Section 19(2) of the IBC-IA No. 1557 of 2024 was filed against the Company Secretary of Skil Infrastructure Limited owing to non cooperation faced by the IRP. Since Skil Infrastructure Limited is a listed entity, and in view of the non-cooperation from the in-house Company Secretary, who is also a Key Managerial Personnel (KMP), the IRP was compelled to engage an external Company Secretary firm to ensure timely and proper discharge of statutory and regulatory compliances. Subsequently, the in-house Company Secretary is extending limited cooperation. The statutory auditors of Skil Infrastructure Limited, who had earlier cooperated in finalizing the financial results for the quarters ended March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2024, subsequently declined to proceed with finalizing the accounts for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, unless their outstanding past dues were cleared. The IRP informed

Thanking you, Yours sincerely, 
them that their dues pertained to the pre-CIRP period and, therefore, they were required to file their claim in the CIRP process. Upon their continued refusal, the IRP, after issuing requisite legal notice, filed a non-cooperation application under Section 19 of the IBC, being IA No. 4015 of 2025, before the Hon'ble NCLT on August 23, 2025. Thereafter, the statutory auditors, vide email dated October 31, 2025, expressed their willingness to cooperate in completing the books of accounts of Skil Infrastructure Limited.

Due to the prolonged legal proceedings referenced above, and as a result of the lack of cooperation initially from the Company Secretary and subsequently from the Statutory Auditors, the Company has been unable to compile, finalize, approve, and submit its financial results for the period ended September 30, 2025. We assure you that the Company, along with the Interim Resolution Professional, will make every endeavour to prepare and submit the pending financial statements at the earliest possible opportunity, upon regularization of access to records and further progress of the statutory processes under the CIRP. We request the Stock Exchange to kindly take note of the above circumstances, which were beyond the control of the Company, and to grant suitable relaxation and understanding with respect to the delayed submission of the financial results.
