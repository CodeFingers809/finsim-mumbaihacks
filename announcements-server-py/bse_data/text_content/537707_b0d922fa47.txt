Limited Review Report on unaudited quarterly standalone financial results of Laddu Gopal Online
Services Limited (Formerly known as ETT Limited) pursuant to the Regulation 33 of SEBI (Listing
Obligation and Disclosure Requirements) Regulation, 2015 ("Listing Regulations")
To the Board of Directors of
Laddu Gopal Online Services Limited (Formerly known as ETT Limited)
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results of Laddu
Gopal Online Services Limited (Formerly known as ETT Limited) ("the Company") for the

thereon attached herewith, being submitted by the company pursuant to the requirements
of Regulation 33 of SEBI (Listing Obligation and Disclosure Requirements) Regulation, 2015
("Listing Regulations") as amended.

the Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and
measurement principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial
Reporting" ("lnd AS 34"), prescribed under section 133 of the companies Act, 2013 read with
Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules,2015 as amended, read with
circulars and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to
issue a report on these financial statements based on our review.
3. We conducted our review of the statement in accordance with the Standard on Review
Engagement (SRE) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information performed by the
Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued bythe Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance
as to whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. A review is limited
primarily to inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial
data and thus provides less assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes US
