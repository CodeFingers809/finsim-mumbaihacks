Q2 & H1 FY26 Post Earnings Conference Call 
November 17, 2025 3:30 PM IST 
Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of KAPTIFY Consulting Investor 
Relations team, I welcome you all to the Q2 and H1 FY 2026 Post 
Earnings Conference Call of Royal Orchid Hotels Limited. Today on 
the call from the management team, we have with us Mr. Chander K 
Baljee, Chairman and Managing Director; Mr. Arjun Baljee, President; 
Mr. Keshav Baljee, Non-Executive Director; and Mr. Amit Jaiswal, 
Chief Financial Officer. 
As a disclaimer, I would like to inform all of you that this call may 
contain forward-looking statements, which may involve risks and 
uncertainties. Also, a reminder that this call 1s being recorded. 
I would now request the management to brief us about the business 
and performance highlights for the period ended September 2025, the 
growth plan and vision for the coming years, post which we will open 
the floor for Q&A. 
Over to the management team. 
Good evening, dear friends, partners, and members of our investment 
community. As someone, who has spent a lifetime building in this 
industry, I've learned that the real measure of progress 1s just not in 
numbers, but in the confidence with which you walk into the future. A 
few days ago, standing in the lobby of ICONIQA Mumbai and 
watching our first guest walk-in, I felt this confidence very strongly. 
Just months ago, ICONIQA Mumbai was a shell, today it stands as a 
292-key lifestyle landmark at Mumbai's T2 airport, delivered ahead of 
time within unprecedented budget and designed to set new 
benchmarks for our brand. That moment reminded me that Royal 
Orchid Hotels is entering a new era. We are not simplifying 
expanding. We are evolving with greater clarity, sharper execution and 
stronger market position. We are stepping into a space where speed, 
discipline and an asset-light scale are working in perfect alignment. 
Performance overview. Growth built on discipline. Let me take you 
through our performance for Q2 FY 2026. Consolidated revenues rose 
to %86.8 crores, up 10.7% Y-o-Y. EBITDA stood at %20.8 crores, 
reflecting 7% Y-on-Y growth. Net profit after associates for quarter 
was 4.3 crores.

Q2 & H1 FY26 Post Earnings Conference Call 
November 17, 2025 3:30 PM IST 
For H1 FY 2026, consolidated revenue grew 8.7% to %169.6 crores. 
EBITDA increased 9% to %44.5 crores. Cash profit improved to %28.4 
crores. This result reflects steady dependable growth supported by 
18% Y-o-Y increase in room revenue, 34% in other services, 
consistent performance across managed and revenue share hotels. 
While Q2 includes a onetime Ind AS impact due to commissioning of 
ICONIQA Mumbai, the underlying business remains __ strong, 
diversified and resilient, exactly what long-term investment look for. 
Portfolio strength, a foundation of scale and stability. This quarter, we 
strengthened our portfolio with three new openings, ICONIQA 
Mumbai, Regenta Central Solapur, Regenta Resort Tropical Village 
Mysore. Together, they added 388 keys to our system. Today, Royal 
Orchid Hotel stands at 119 plus operational hotels, 7,437 operational 
rooms and 9,989 total keys, including signed properties and presence 
across 80 cities in India and abroad. This scale gives us balanced 
exposure, stronger market presence and _ diversified demand 
challenges, reinforcing our position in the hospitality landscape. 
Execution excellence. The core of our market advantage. ICONIQA 
Mumbai not just the hotel opening, the proof of point of execution 
discipline that defines us, a 29 to 292 key lifestyle hotel delivered in 
record time, built with sharp cost and design excellence, operationally 
ready from day one. This is a template for the next decade for Royal 
Orchid Hotels, sharper execution, sharper brand segmentation, strong 
ROC principle, purposeful expansion across Regenta Z, Place, 
Crestoria and ICONIQA. We are scaling not by adding assets, but by 
strengthening our capabilities, technology, design-led operational 
excellence. 
Vision 2030, clear ambitions and backed by capability. Our North Star 
remains focused and ambitious to triple our portfolio from 119-plus to 
345 hotels by 2030 and expand our 22,000-plus keys. This will be 
powered by a clear brand architecture, a disciplined asset-light model, 
extensive use of technology and AI across operations. Regenta 
Rewards evolved with a strong unified loyalty engine, rising domestic 
travel, strong leisure demand and expanding corporate mobility. 
We are building a hospitality ecosystem that blends Indian warmth 
with global efficiency, greater intelligence, seamless, delightful 
experience for every guest. A future of scalable, sustainable, and high 
confidence growth. We are prepared for the next phase of our journey. 
We do this with a disciplined balance sheet, a robust pipeline of hotels 
across key markets, strengthening brand loyalty and execution engine

that consistently delivers ahead of expectations. We're not just adding 
room. We're building a legacy of service, opportunity and long-term 
value creation. 
With growing demand, expanding footprint, rising profitability and a 
steadfast contribution, I can say with conviction, Royal Orchid has the 
foundation, the resolution and the momentum to deliver strong, 
sustained growth. To all our investors and partners, thank you for your 
trust, your belief and your continued support. The future of Royal 
Orchid is bright, ambitious and firmly in motion. Thank you. 
Thank you. Arjun, would you like to add something on ICONIQA and 
the progress of it and how things are today? 
Sure. Thank you, everyone, for all of those who have not seen 
ICONIQA, would love for you to come and have a look at what we've 
built. Your company built this hotel from shell to completion in 11 
months or under a year, which is unprecedented. We're very fortunate 
to have received great reviews, which are now on TripAdvisor, which 
the influencers across social channels have consistently spoken about 
our food and beverage offerings. 
And I think over the next couple of months, you'll see the hotel track 
exactly what we've stated earlier, which 1s in the 70% occupancy with 
in and around the 8,000 ARR mark, and we're well on our way to 
doing that. 
This is as of today, we are ranked #3 out of the Mumbai hotels. So for 
a hotel to be open for a little under two months and to already be 
ranked #3, we are very, very proud of this. And you can see the 
reviews and see what we're doing right and it's just onwards and 
upwards from here. Thank you.

there 1s a problem at your end, you can put the message 1n chat. We'll 
take the first question from Rahul. Rahul you can go ahead. 
Thank you for taking my question. Congratulations on getting that 
ICONIQA thing, ICONIQA. The ICONIQA up and running in such a 
short period of time. I have had the pleasure of visiting the place. It's a 
fabulous place. Just to get a clear sense, if you could just give us a

sense on the numbers of ICONIQA. I know it's only a month in this 
thing, but it has a disproportionate impact on the quarterly numbers of 
the base business that we were doing, which is ex-ICONIQA. Just a 
sense on what are the numbers of ICONIQA for this quarter, I'm 
assuming there would be a loss? So it would be of great help to kind of 
analyse the base business as well. Thank you. 
So, Rahul, as you know, we started the hotel towards the end of 
September. However, the operational preopening loss we had to book 
of around %2 crore. And of course, the Ind AS adjustment of %6.35 
crores, which I have highlighted in my presentation. 
So essentially, we are talking operational loss, whatever turnover you 
may have recognised, little turnover you may have recognised. And 
the OpEx itself, that 1s about %2 crores loss that we have booked in 
Q2... 
Basically pre-operating expenses, which we could not capitalise has to 
be written off in the books. So that loss has come as %2 crore and 
6.35 crores, we have highlighted in our presentation. That is the Ind 
AS adjustment of, because it's a 25-year lease. So that needs to be 
done. So t's... 
What would be the quarterly run rate here, sir? %6.35 crores is 
proportionate for the quarter? What would be the full quarter run rate 
of this Ind AS? 
No. See, this was half year. So in next half year, also around 88 crores 
to 9 crores will come, Ind AS. 
6.35 crores was for the half year? 
Yes, yes. So total for the year, it 1s coming around %6.15 crores. So 
around %8.5 crores in the next two quarters, depending on the 
operations and all. That's how the calculation happens. 
Won't we -- talking about ¥36 Cr kind of rent number so that we have 
distributed because of the Ind AS like this, 15 crore number? 
215 crores, plus %36 crores, it will come. So that's how it goes. 
Okay, yeah, I thought the rent becomes the lease liability in the ROE 
part and then that gets running through in the form of interest and 
depreciation.

Q2 & H1 FY26 Post Earnings Conference Call 
November 17, 2025 3:30 PM IST 
You are right, Rahul. But what happens, it goes up because of the 
initial years. So it gets averaged out over 25 years. So the average -- 
initially, the Ind AS adjustment will be more. And slowly, it will taper 
down. 
Okay. And just a question on how has -- Arjun has already indicated 
that we are on track to kind of need towards our target of occupancies 
and all. How has October and November kind of trended? 
So it is good. See, initially, we had given an indication of 75 crores 
because we were targeting to open it in the month of July. But since it 
has got delayed by almost 2.5 months, so now we are looking at 
somewhere around %50-odd crores for the year, revenues. 
Over Q3 and Q4 %50-odd crores. 
Yes. 
Right, thank you very much for answering those questions. Thank 
you. 
Anybody else who wishes to ask a question may please use the option 
of raise hand. Rahul, you can come back again. 
Yeah, since I thought I'd just come back in the queue. And if you 
could help us with this quarter's cost structure, whatever you have 
reported, how much of it is kind of built in and cooked into the 
number like how much of ICONIQA cost is cooked into the numbers 
here? 
Roughly, almost %5 crores have been cooked tn. 
And what do you expect the OpEx number to be for ICONIQA on a 
monthly basis? 5 crores 1s a good guess there? 
On a monthly basis, somewhere around %4 crores, %4.5 crores it will 
be. 
%4 crores, 4.5 crores of OpEx. And this quarter, you are at %5 crores? 
¥5 crores, yes. 
Okay, I will come back. Thank you.

Q2 & H1 FY26 Post Earnings Conference Call 
November 17, 2025 3:30 PM IST 
So there's one question in the chat. With the success of ICONIQA, can 
you throw some more light on further plans with ICONIQA and from 
the Crestoria brand. Mr. Baljee? 
Mr. Baljee? 
Yeah, if you see the hierarchy of the -- ICONIQA 1s a 5-star top-class 
hotel. So that will be, of course, expansion will be slow because we 
are not franchising that. And if we get abandonment or lease, yes, we 
will take it. So that will be slow because there's a heavy investment 
involved also. 
But as far as Crestoria is concerned, it's a non-standardised kind of a 
product, but catering to a very boutique upmarket hotels. So we are 
already working towards two Crestoria hotels, which should open very 
shortly. And then, of course, our bread and butter, such as your 
Regenta and Regenta Place, two brands which are rapidly expanding. 
We have 38 hotels which are already signed up and out of which only 
about two are Crestoria, but other expansion is going on very rapidly, 
and we want to continue that in the mid-market space. 
And of course, the biggest growth which we just started, will come 
from Regenta Z, which 1s a franchise model where we'll provide all 
the technical know-how to set up the hotel and we will train the 
General Manager and the HODs very soon. 
Operationally also very light, minimum service hotels, which will be 
like neighbour hotels in the range of 40 to 50 rooms or 40 to 60 rooms 
hotels, which will be the most rapid expansion. So I think this 1s what 
our growth path is in the near future. 
We will take the next question from Priyank. Priyank, you can go 
ahead. 
Yeah, thanks for the opportunity. Sir, my first question is on the 
employee expenses. So this quarter, we recorded around %25 Cr of 
employee expenses. So what could be the quarterly run rate going 
forward considering there is a sharp increase over the previous 
numbers? 
This year, of course, there has been a boom in the hotel industry and a 
large number of hotels are opening. So we are definitely having a 
pressure for people who are approaching our staff, well-trained staff.

Q2 & H1 FY26 Post Earnings Conference Call 
November 17, 2025 3:30 PM IST 
So we have to give some extraordinary increase. But that 1s not going 
to last for too long. 
We are taking other measures also like trainees, on-the-job trainings, 
trainees from the hotel colleges. We are getting a lot of apprentices 
who are joining us. We are also taking some contract staff, which we 
had staffed earlier. So we are taking those measures. And of course, 
we have done our management development programme where we are 
trying to churn up as many in-house General Managers as we can, 
although the number is very large, we may not be able to do all. 
But that will give us more reliable trend in our brand standards, 
General Managers and HODs for the future. So that is where we want 
to beefed up by HR and training department, and that's going on very 
ageressively to well, if not reduce at least maintain the percentage of 
costs. So a lot of changes which we have done will increase boost our 
revenues. Therefore, our percentage of employee cost to the revenue 
will either come down or remain the same. 
So adding to what Mr. Baljee said, Priyank, let me tell you this ¥25 
crores includes almost %3 crores of employee cost of ICONIQA 
Mumbai, which has yet to give the full fledge start. That 1s why it is 
looking on the higher side in comparison to that. 
Yeah, that is understood, sir. So 25 Cr would be new normal going 
forward? 
Roughly around 25 crores to ¥25.5 crores would be the new normal. 
Okay. Understood. Now on the rent side. So I noted that in cash flow 
statement, we have booked 218 Cr kind of rent for the half year. 
However, the pre-Ind AS number for the rent in our investor 
presentation comes around %11 crores. So why this difference is there? 
That's what I told you that Ind AS adjustment of %6.35 crores of 
ICONIQA has hit the P&L. 
No. So the lease liability payment of 718 Cr for this half year, so how 
much would be for the second half? 
Second half is $18 Cr to be booked and minus the Ind AS adjustment 
or plus the Ind AS adjustment. 
Plus the Ind AS adjustment.

November 17, 2025 3:30 PM IST 
Yes. The first half, you said it's $18 crores come down to ®11 crores. 
That's because we had booked it earlier thinking the hotel would start 
three months than it actually did. 
No, no, Mr. Arjun Baljee, let me correct it. See, as far as the rent 
hability pre-Ind AS is concerned of ICONIQA, there is no rent 
liability. Pre-Ind AS, there is no rent liability of ICONIQA, which is 
being booked. 
No, that's correct. So the pre-Ind AS number versus the post-Ind AS 
number for the EBITDA, there is a differential of %11 Cr, right? 
Yes. 
So that should be the rent? 
Yes. 
Now the cash flow statement, we are seeing the rent of 718 Cr? 
Yes. 
Yes. So my question 1s, particularly that only, then why that difference 
is there? 
One second, I'll just tell you. See, as far as the cash flow is concerned, 
cash flow, we add to the net profit, the depreciation and finance costs. 
Okay? 
Sorry for interrupting you. I am looking at the cash flow from the 
financing activity, the interest and the principal portion for the lease. 
So if I am totalling that, that is coming around %18 Cr. So my rent 
outflow for the first half of the year 1s 218 Cr. 
Yes. 
Okay. And now for the pre-Ind AS versus the post-Ind AS EBITDA 
number, the differential, which is attributable to the rent, 1t 1s around 
R11 Cr. 
So rent expense, we have taken %5.7 crores for the quarter. You are 
looking at the half year, right?

November 17, 2025 3:30 PM IST 
Yes. For the quarter, it is ¥5.4 Cr. 
But the =11.1 crores we have taken. Now the %6 crore has been 
plugged in into depreciation and finance costs. 
That 1s understood. So for... 
11 crores is without the ICONIQA rent. 
Yeah. So the ICONIQA rent has not been factored in. 
No, no. That's what I told you. ICONIQA rent has been -- there's no 
rent, which has accrued on ICONIQA Hotel. It will start accruing only 
from 15th of November. 
Okay. So we have paid some rent in advance. Is that what we are 
trying to say? 
No, no, no. We have not paid in rent in advance. We have done the 
adjustment of Ind AS adjustment for the entire period of ¥25 crores 
and discounted it for this period and booked at %6.35 crores in 
depreciation and finance costs towards that rent. 
Okay. And for the second half, how much rent we are expecting in 
terms of cash flow? 
As far as the cash flow is concerned, in the second half means from 
October to March, we will be incurring around 2®12 crores, ~13 crores 
of rent. 
Okay. Understood. Perfect. Yeah. Thank you. That's it from my side. 
Thank you. 
Thanks, Priyank. We'll take the next question from Prashant Kanojia. 
Prashant, please go ahead. 
First of all, I would like to congratulate you on the opening of 
ICONIQA. The pictures look really amazing on TripAdvisor and the 
reviews do as well. And 11 months 1s an amazing time to open it. And 
my question is perhaps to Arjun. In terms of -- I know that you guys 
are focused on return on capital. And I would love to understand the 
framework you have for an asset like ICONIQA, which is a leased 
asset. How you guys think in terms of return on capital for an 
investment like that? As the company, I guess, we want to scale up a

Prashant Kanojia:

few more ICONIQAs in the future? I would love to understand your 
framework on this. 
Sure. Thanks for the question, Prashant, and we'd love to see you at 
the hotel, if you'd experience it firsthand rather than just through 
TripAdvisor. But when we decided that we focus a company like a 
private equity shop and figure out how do those guys look at a return 
on capital, right? And everything, while it is Excel, you're looking at a 
very data-driven theory on where you would deploy your money. 
So things like STR reports, things like what's happening in the market, 
is there going to be absorption of commercial spaces, so on and so 
forth. You look at all that data to figure out demand. Now it's not 
accurate, okay? It can never be accurate. Given the experience we 
have and given what is happening in the market, it gives you some 
dipstick understanding of if you were to do hotel positioned in a -- let's 
say, it's upper mid-scale or 1n the upscale lifestyle like we were talking 
about or like ICONIQA 1s, if you were to do an upscale lifestyle hotel, 
what is the industry benchmark of what it would cost, okay? So there 
are rule of thumbs and those numbers are available out in the public 
domain. 
So the way we think about it is that 1f a chair cost 20,000, can we get 
that chair done for 8,500. Those are fundamental value engineering 
things that we look at in order to help reduce cost, our input cost into 
the project to begin with, okay? You know your end goal. You know 
where the market is. I mean, it will be foolish of us to say we can come 
in here and invest and outperform the Fairmonts of the world. I mean, 
it's foolish. 
So you need to first create what is the target segment you want to go 
after, what returns and yields that target segment generates. Then what 
is the sort of return metric and profile you want to create. Therefore, 
determine what sort of cost you want to incur and take it from there. 
So there's a bottom approach and a top-down approach that one looks 
at from an investment of this scale. And this is large scale for us, right? 
Yeah. That makes sense. But I guess in terms of, is there a particular 
number you guys want to target like after the hotel stabilises in terms 
of yield on the asset? 
Well, listen. Asset yield 1s a very different metric. So let's look around 
us. We look at the ROCE metric, which we said, listen 25% return on 
capital is kind of what we really want our portfolio to perform it. And

that will be great. Now from a comparison perspective, our 
competitors own their assets. Therefore, they have huge interest and 
repayment and huge amounts of CapEx upfront. 
We, in turn, have lease rent. So there is an asset liability per se on for 
both people. So we're just looking at how does one earn a return on 
that dollar invested in quicker, right, from a cash basis because you 
guys at the investors value us on a cash basis, right, and not really the 
NAV of the asset. That was really our thesis. 
Thank you. 
Pleasure. 
Anybody who wishes to ask a question, please raise your hand. We'll 
take the next question from Chirag. Chirag you can go ahead. 
Thanks for the opportunity. First question on the ICONIQA expense 
that we reported in the quarter. So you said there's a ®2 crore OpEx 
with regards to ICONIQA and there is 3 crore employee expense. So 
5 crore is the impact on the P&L for the quarter? Is it the right 
understanding? 
Yes. 
And what were the total revenues from ICONIQA... 
Around %3 crores. 
%3 crores. Okay. And second question is on the rent. So you mentioned 
that there is no rent cash outflow in the quarter. And it will only start 
from 15th of November. So why 1s there isn't the hotel has started, 
right? 
We had a rent-free period of three months from the date of getting the 
-- when the hotel is ready to operate. 
Okay. Understood. That would be it from my end. Thanks. 
We take the next question from Anshuman. Anshuman, you can go 
ahead, please. 
Yeah, hello. Thank you for the opportunity. So my first question 1s, 
what is the lower ARR in Q2 versus the last year Q2, and this year Q1

and similarly lower occupancy rates? Also, how does this equate with 
the net guest being higher so domestic increased by 14,000 Y-o-Y, 
while foreign guest reduced 4,000 Y-o-Y. 
So Anshuman, let me tell you the ADR. ARR, we have got 5,479 as 
against 5,114 for last year. Our occupancies were 67% as against 70% 
last year. And in our managed segment, we had an ADR of 3,552 as 
against 3,574 last year, an occupancy of 54% as against 58%. 
He's asking why is it lower? 
Why is it lower means, see, generally second quarter when it rains 
across the North India, the occupancies were quite low. And even Goa 
market also did not do that well in this year, reasons are there are a lot 
of issues which is going on in the Goa market, the taxi issues and all. 
So that is why the occupancies got a little bit hit, whereas ADR, we 
have improved upon the ADR since last year. 
Yes. And my another question is that what has led to higher payroll 
cost Y-o-Y and Q-o0-Q? 
As we explained, the payroll cost includes the three months 
preopening payroll cost of ICONIQA of around %3 crores. That is why 
you are seeing a surge in the payroll cost whereas the revenues have 
started coming only mid-September. That is why the payroll cost looks 
a little higher for ICONIQA. 
Okay. And my last question is that where are on the modernisation in 
our Goa and Bangalore hotels? 
Mr. Baljee, would you like to... 
Yes. In Goa hotel, we are actively pursuing it, but there is an issue of 
change of land use where certain parties had gone to the court to stop 
the smooth conversion of land. But I'm told that the thing should be 
through very shortly. So once the land use issue was settled, plans are 
ready, then we will get the plan sanctioned. And we hope that, but 
right now, we don't want to do anything right now, any case because 
it's a season. So we hope to start the work sometimes in the month of 
April when there is no season as far as we think. 
As far as the other hotels are concerned, we have just completed our 
28 rooms, 28 wooden cottages in the resort in Bangalore. So that has 
been done, and it's come out very well, received also very well. Just

about less than a month ago, we started that. It gives a very like 
ambience in the whole place. The inventory from 54 has gone to 82 
rooms. And we hope to increase the revenue by about at least 70% to 
80% of the room revenue. 
We are taking up the Dhaba renovation and the banquet hall 
renovation very shortly. The plans are getting ready, tenders are being 
invited. That work is going on. We have out of the 50 rooms, which 
were to be renovated in Royal Orchid Hotel, up to 37 rooms were 
already renovated. The balance 13 rooms, we have just kept it hold till 
the month of March. And March, we'll start. 
Everything ready. I think once we start in two months' time, April and 
May, we hope to finish those renovation. We are also now planning to 
renovate our Central Hotel that is Manipal Centre on MG Road, which 
is 130-room 4-star hotel. There, we have just invited a few architects 
to give us some plans. So I think in about three to six months plan, 
plan should be ready, and then we'll take up that renovation also. So 
this was our renovation and expansion plan is. 
Okay, thank you for the opportunity. 
Thank you. We'll take the next question from Yash Dantewadia. Yash, 
you can go ahead, please. 
Yeah, hi. I'm sorry, this 1s repetitive and I missed the first half of the 
con call, really sorry for that. My question is regarding this ICONIQA 
hotel. Just wanted to understand, I've seen online for a lot of days, it's 
already sold out. I think even on this weekend for Friday, I think it's 
showing sold out. So the %100 crore number on this hotel, how far do 
you see it annual number? I'm talking about F&B included. Is 100 
crore aright estimate? Or are you expecting more or less? 
Next year, we are targeting because we have started in the mid of 
September. So this year, definitely 100 crores is not possible. But 
next year, we will definitely cross 2100 crores. 
Right. And as far as your 4-star hotel in Bangalore that's there, and 
you were talking about renovations, could you approximately give us 
some cost guidance on that and renovation room by room. Are you 
going to close down the hotel? 
No. We're not going to close down the hotel. That's something I can 
tell you. We are very prudent in that way. Even with our main

flagship, the Royal Orchid in Bangalore, we closed down floor by 
floor. So Royal Orchid Central, Manipal Centre will go under the 
knife in a phased manner, perhaps a floor retirement, but we will not 
close the hotel down. 
But could you give us some sort of guidance on the cost or range 
would work? 
I think you're a little pretty premature. As Mr. Baljee said, we're in the 
middle of just finalising the plan of how to go about it and then where 
to position it. And earlier, we had stated that once you position the 
hotel with the right use of the right return profile for the asset, then 
we'll figure out the investment, and we'll figure out how to go about 
this. So I think we're a couple of weeks away from actually giving 
those numbers or estimate. 
That's fine. But are we trying to convert, so I know Bangalore, I'm 
from Bangalore. So it's a very premium area, right, MG Road. My 
question is, are you trying to convert that into a 5-star hotel by any 
chance? Are we going to see a renovation of that scale? Or is it going 
to remain a 4-star hotel? 
4-star hotel, but we'll upgrade it. 
Okay. And my next question is, are we going to see any more hotels 
coming under the lease contract this year, like the ICONIQA in 
Mumbai? Do you have anything more on that scale under discussions 
of any sort? 
So listen, discussions is one, but on the upcoming hotels on the 38 
hotels that we've listed out, there are five hotels under the revenue 
share model that we are currently working towards executing. There 1s 
the Regenta, which is a 120-key hotel in Gurgaon Sector 20, Lucknow 
is a 172-room hotel, a large property. And then you've got the North 
Goa asset in Dodamarg, again under Regenta Resort. We have a small 
Crestoria, the first of its kind, it's going to be really, really boutique 
lovely under revenue share as well. 
How many rooms is that, the last one? 
Crestoria is about 40 keys. But it's upscale. It's very upscale, and it 
will be a really nice hotel experiential.

All right. All in all, what are we guiding for next year? Next financial 
year? 
We have given the guideline in our presentation, 1f you really look at 
it. Next two years, we have given. And I think we should be there. 
We're at the 450 mark. 
Right, right. And are we confident of this number? 
Yes. 
Thank you. I will just come in queue. 
Sure, thank you. 
Thank you. We'll take the next question from Aishwarya. Aishwarya, 
please go ahead. 
Thank you. Good evening. I have two questions. First one is, could 
you throw some light on the role being played by senior management 
teams between them on strategy, new hotel openings, negotiations, 
etc? 
Mr. Baljee? 
Yes, you see all new projects are now discussed almost on a weekly 
basis with the development team and the cluster heads. Cluster heads 
are also involved in evaluating the project. The development team 
brings the project, evaluates it, brings to the cluster head. And then we 
have a joint Zoom call or so to say yes or no, and/or maybe seek some 
more information about the market, either the market, so many hotels 
gets turned down because the market is not -- hotel may be good. The 
owners may have very ambitious plans, but the market may not be that 
strong or stable. 
So some hotels will be turned down. Some hotels, we go into deeper 
details and get more information. But all this has to be done very 
confidentially and very fast because otherwise, information can leak to 
the market. But today, owners are also very smart. They engage a 
consultant who lines up most of the various chains. So we have to 
really show that how we are really actually performing against the 
competition chains. So we have to show that in certain.

A lot of markets, we are performing better. Some we are not 
performing that good. So there, the focus is on now sales and 
marketing. We have engaged new professions in sales and marketing. 
And their focus is to look at all the hotels, which are not 1n the one or 
two positions in the market. How are they? So we're trying to push 
that also. So a lot of work has gone in and we are trying to get AI also 
into action to improve our, one is, efficiency, reduce costs and 
increase sales and profitability. 
My next question is we have recently seen Indian hotels acquiring 
something on the wellness side. So any plans that you will have on 
similar lines to acquire any allied businesses, or any other hotels or 
smaller chains or something on the food and beverage side? 
No. We are looking at acquisition. But obviously, acquisition has got 
to do with something with how much deep pockets you have. And 
Indian hotel does have much deeper pockets with Tata backing also. 
But this 1s something which is definitely being explored by us. And so 
that will bump up our development rather than going organically one 
by one, one, two hotels, 1f we need a little bump. So we are exploring. 
I can't tell you what we're exploring, but we are definitely exploring 
that. Maybe smaller weaker chains, which we're trying to see whether 
we can have a strategic tie-up with them. 
Got it. Thank you and wish you all the best. 
Thank you. Anybody else who wishes to ask a question may please 
raise hand. I have a question on chat from Kavina Desai. Can you 
provide some context on the F&B revenue trend going forward? And 
since it 1s down this quarter, where do you see it? And any guidance 
for EBITDA margins and debt for FY 2026-2027? 
So let me just take the F&B question. Over the last few months, we've 
had a strategic review of the F&B of our hotels to understand what 
restaurants work, what doesn't work, what food works or doesn't work. 
Obviously, the customer 1s rapidly changing, the customer demands 
and preferences are changing and standalones are eating the lunch of 
the mid-market hotel players. 
So in that light, we are in the middle of revamping and rolling out new 
F&B concepts along our managed hotel partners today. So in the next 
couple of months, the F&B will have, whether it's the menus refresh, 
whether it's concept refresh. So all of that is being done strategically 
as we speak. So rest assured, I think F&B contributes about 40% of

revenue right now, and that number should remain stable and not go 
down. 
Since there are no further questions, would you like to give any 
closing comments? 
I'm really happy to see a lot of participations by the people and a lot of 
questions which we can think of for the next quarter and be prepared 
for better answers. Thank you very much for joining us, and we look 
forward to your continued support. And we can assure you from our 
side that we'll leave no stone unturned to make this company better 
and better quarter-on-quarter. Thank you. 
Thank you, sir, and thank you to all the participants for joining on this 
call. Thank you to the management team. This brings us to end of
