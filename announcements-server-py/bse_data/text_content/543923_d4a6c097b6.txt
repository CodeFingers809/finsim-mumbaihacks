Pursuant to Regulation 30 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, and in continuation of our earlier intimation dated December 6, 2024, we 
wish to provide an update on the Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) executed between 
Royalux LLC, USA wholly owned step down subsidiary of the Company and Metco 
Engineering Inc., USA, wherein the parties had agreed on a potential business engagement of 
USD 8 million to be achieved within a period of six months. METCO assures business of 8 
MN USD in next 6 months from the signing of the MOU. 
During the first six months of the MOU period, the Royalux LLC has achieved actual sales of 
approximately USD 679,648. Further, the cumulative sales for the nine months period, up to 
30th September 2025, stand at USD 1,047,648. The shortfall from the projected value was 
primarily due to a slower operational ramp-up, and prevailing market conditions in the U.S due 
to imposition of Tariff by US Govt. 
The Royalux LLC and Metco Engineering Inc. continue to maintain a positive business 
relationship, but the remaining pending orders may or may not be achieved in the coming 
months. 
You are requested to take the above information on record. 
Thanking You, 
For IKIO Technologies Limited
