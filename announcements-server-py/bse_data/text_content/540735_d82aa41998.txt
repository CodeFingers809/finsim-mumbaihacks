Independent Auditor's Limited Review Report on unaudited consolidated financial results for the quarter ended 
30 September 2025 and year to date results for the period from 01 April 2025 to 30 September 2025 of IRIS Business 
Services Limited under Regulation 33 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended. 
To, 
The Board of Directors of 
IRIS Business Services Limited. 
Introduction 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited consolidated financial results of IRIS Business Services 
Limited (the 'Parent') and its subsidiaries (the Parent and its subsidiaries together referred to as the 'Group') for the 
quart er ended 30 September 2025 and year to date results for the period from 01 April 2025 to 30 September 2025 
(the 'Statement '), being submitted by the Company pursuantto the requirements of Regulation 33 of the Securities 
and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended 
('Listing Regulations'). We have initialled the Statement for identification purpose only. 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and approved by the Company's Board 
of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurem ent principles laid down in the 
Indian Accounting Standard ('Ind AS') 34 'Interim Financial Reporting' prescribed under section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013, as amended (the 'Act') read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. Our 
responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
Scope of Review 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements ('SRE') 2410 -
'Review of Interim Financial Inform ation Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity' , issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India (the 'ICAI'). A review of interim financial information consists of makin g inquiri es, 
prim arily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applyi'flg analytical and other review 
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing 
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matter s 
that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
We also performed procedures in accordance with the circular Issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India 
under Regulation 33(8) of the Listing Regulations, to th e extent applicable.

Assets and liabilities used in the Company's business are not identifiable to any of the reportable segment, as these are used interchangeably between segments. The 
management believes that it not practicable to provide segment disclosures relating 10 total assets and liabilities, 
Notes: 
a. The consolidated financial results of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards 
prescribed under section 133 of the Compan ies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 20 I 5 
as amended from time to time and other recognised accounting practices genera lly accepted in India. 
b. The above consolidated financial results for the quarter and half year ended September 30, 2025 were reviewed , and 
recomme nded by the Audit committee of the Board and approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting held on Novembe r

6 IRIS Re2tech Sdn. Bhd. Whollv Owned Subsidiary 
d. Based on the "management approach" as defined in Ind-AS I 08 - Operating Segments , the Chief Operating Decision Maker 
evaluates the Group's performance on three business segments, namely: "SupTech", "RegT ech", and "DataTech". These 
segments represent separate lines of business that generate revenues and incur expenses independently from each other. For 
internal reporting and decision-making purposes, the CODM evaluates segment performanc e based on revenues and directly 
attributable costs, without allocation of costs that cannot be directly attributable to the business segment. Accordingly , costs 
that are not directly attributable to business segme nt are disclosed separate ly as unallocated expenses. Previous period figures 
have been regrouped/reclassified wherever necessary to conform to the above presentation. 
e. With respect to our investment in IRIS Business Services, LLC incorporated in USA (the 'Subsidiary') as at September 30, 
2025 the total liabilities exceeded its total assets by~ 57.01 lakhs. The Company is comm itted to provide necessary financial 
support as and when necessary. Considering the future prospect of the Subsidiary and continued support of the Company , the 
investme nt in the Subsidiary is measured at cost. 
f. In the light of the future prospect of the Subsid iary and committed continued support of Parent, financial results of the 
subsid iary mentioned in point (e) have been prepared on a going concern basis and the same is cons idered for preparation of 
consolidated financial results. 
g. During the quarter ended 30 September 2025, the Company divested its Tax Technology GST Applica tion Service Provider 
('GST ASP') business, along with its 100% equity stake in IRIS Logix Solutions Private Limited, to Sovos Compliance 
Limited , UK, and its e-invoicing business in Malaysia to Sovos Malaysia. The divestments form part of a strategic initiative to 
simplify operations and focus on core business lines. The transactions resulted in recognition of an exceptiona l gain, and the 
GST ASP business has been presented as discontinued operations in accordance with Ind AS I 05. 
h. Correspond ing previous year/ period's figures have been regrouped and reclassified wherever necessary.

September 2025 and year to date results for the period from 01 April 2025 to 30 September 2025 of IRIS Business 
Services Limited under Regulation 33 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended. 
To, 
The Board of Directors of 
~ IRIS Business Services Limited. 
Introduction 
1. We have reviewed the accompa nying statement of unaudit ed standalone financial results of IRIS Business Services 
Limit ed (the 'Company ') for the quarter ended 30 September 2025 and year to date results for the period from 01 
April 2025 to 30 September 2025 (the 'Statement'), being subm itted by the Company pursuant to the requirements 
of Regulation 33 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, as amended ('Listing Regulation s'). We have initialled the Statement for identification purpo se 
only . 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibi lity of the Company's Management and approved by the Board of Directors 
of the Company, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in 
the Indian Accounting Standard ('Ind AS') 34 'Interim Financial Reporting' specified in section 133 of the Companies 
Act, 2013, as amended (the 'Act') read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accountin g principles 
generally accepted in India and in compli ance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. Our responsibility is to 
express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
Scope of Review 
3. We conduct ed our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements ('SRE') 2410 -
'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of th e Entity' issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of Indi a (the 'ICAI'). This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obta in 
moderate assurance as to wheth er the Statement is free of material misstatement. \ review is limit ed primari ly to 
inquiri es of company's personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus provides less 
assurance than an audit . We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do not express an audit opin ion. 
Conclusion 
4. Based on our review condu cted as above, nothing has come to our atte nti on that causes us to believe that the 
accompanyi ng Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in 
the aforesaid Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India has not disclosed the information 
required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations, includin g the manner in which it is to 
be disclosed, or that it conta ins any materi al misstatement. 
Emphasis of Matter 
5. Attention is drawn to Note (e) of the Statement whic h describes the strategic divestment of its Tax technology GST 
Application Service Provider business, sale of 100% equity interest in IRIS Logix Soluti ons Private Limit ed, a who lly
