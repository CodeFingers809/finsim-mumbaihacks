Our business is mainly dependent on funding to formulators for treatment of T8, HIV, Malaria etc. 
from US Aid which is now dis-banned by US government and this has majorly affected our business. 
Presently only Global Fund is funding the treatments with a reduced budget. As the funding has 
slowed down the orders for treatment have also been dropped drastically. 
We have requested a restructuring of the loan with our bank and desired plan will be submitted to 
them by mid-December’25 
We will keep you updated on the progress of our discussions with the bank and the resolution of this 
_ default. We are also making arrangements to pay the overdue amount as soon as possible. 
Thanking You, 
For Mangalam Drugs and Organics Ltd
