That as seen from the reply of the Petitioner 
Companies dated 19.09.2025, in respect of 
105 shares unclaimed dividend was not 
transferred and were rejected due to the 
reason as Invalid Client Status. In this regard, 
the Petitioner Company 1 has been advised to 
furnish detailed clarification in this regard 
vide this office e -mail dated 03.10.2025, the 
Petitioner Companies have furnished reply 
vide e-mail dated 06.10.2025 stating the 105 
shares belong to one shareholder who has not 
claimed the Dividend for the last 7 years and 
hence the company as per the provisions of 
Companies Act, 2013 initiated the process of 
transferring the shares to the IEPF account. 
While doling so, there were certain technical 
problems encountered by NSDL for 
transferring the shares t o the IEPF account.

1 remains committed to resolve the matter 
and will take appropriate action upon receipt 
of the requisite clarification. Further it is 
humble stated that the issue is in the 
Transferee Company/Amalgamated 
Company and thus the pendency of transfer 
to IEPF will not impact the scheme. The 
transferee company/amalgamated company 
will be in existence post the scheme and 
hence will ensure the compliance of 
Companies Act even upon giving effect to the 
Scheme. The reply of the Petitioner Company 
 
 
The Petitioner Companies 
submit that 105 unclaimed shares 
could not be transferred to the 
IEPF Authority due to a technical 
issue in the NSDL system 
reflecting the status as “Invalid 
Client Status.” The

since taken up the matter with its 
Registrar and Transfer Agent and 
the depository participant to 
rectify the same.

liability in the assessment order dated 11 th November 2016, the 
eligible Minimum Alternate Tax credit of Rs.18,48,778 and credit 
for advance tax of Rs.18,58,252 were inadvertently not given due

demand/Nil refund, as against the refund o f Rs.40,64,470/ - as

considered inadvertently by the Income Tax Department as 
“Demand Outstanding”.  
 
c) Subsequently the tax authorities adjusted the demand outstanding 
against the refund available with the Company to the extent of 
Rs.30,19,890/- and further reflected an interest liability amounting to 
Rs.13,99,974/- as payable. Copy of the Adjustment Int imation and 
Challan for the adjustment is enclosed as Annexure 4.  
 
d) In view of the aforesaid discrepancies arising from non -grant of
