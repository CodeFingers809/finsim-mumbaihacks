In view of above, we are unable to comment on the completeness and 
appropriateness of the balances in relation to these subjected matters in the

taken by YEIDA and committee formed by Allahabad High Court will not be given 
effect to without the permission of this court. The matter was last listed on

authenticity, veracity or completeness of the financial position or performance of the 
Co~pany for periods prior to the CIRP commencement date.

sUbjected matters and potential impact of CIRP on any past agreements/decisions

governmental authorities such as Enforcement Directorate (ED), Economic Offences 
Wing (EOW), Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) and Central Bureau of 
Investigation (CEI). However, the outcome of such investigations and its effect on 
the Statement cannot be ascertained. 
6. Disclaimer of Conclusion 
In view of the significance of the matters described in paragraph 5 above and the 
uncertainties involved, we have not been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate 
evidence and therefore, unable to conclude as to whether the Statement has been 
prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in 
the applicable Indian Accounting Standard ("Ind AS") specified under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 as amended, read with relevant Rules and other recognized 
accounting practices and policies or state whether the statement has disclosed the 
information required to be disclosed in terms of the Listing Regulation, read with the 
Circular, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any 
material misstatement. 
7. Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern 
24 April 2025 for inviting resolution plans for the Company. As already disclosed by the 
Company on the stock exchanges, 5 resolution plans (along with earnest money) had 
been received by the RP in response to the RFRP. Further, based on future cash flows, 
the financial results of the company have been prepared on going concern basis but the 
outcome of events and processes initiated under CIRP cannot be presently ascertained 
including matters also listed hereinbefore. The company's ability to remain as going 
concern depends on the outcome of CIRP. Therefore, these events indicate that a 
material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to 
continue as a going concern. 
8. Emphasis of matter 
We draw attention to: 
a) Note no. 4(a) and 4(b) to the Statement which describes details of demands raised 
by Competition Commission of India ('CCI') and its consequential appeals. 
b) Note No. 5 to the Statement regarding recoverability of trade receivables on the

(Bharat) Limited (DCBL) vide letter dated 14.02.2025 considering the clauses in

03.06.2024 and by Hon'ble National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) vide 
its order dated 06.12.2024. And, since the resolution process is under progress as 
stated in Note No. 2 to the Statement, as such loan liability position of Parent is 
based on the CRRP of 2017. The Parent has also received intimation from National 
Asset Reconstruction Company Limited (NARCL) dated 11.03.2025 regarding 
assignment of certain borrowing by Parent from some lenders and consequent,

different than the amount reflecting in the books of accounts of the Parent and 
Claims will be dealt as per the provisions of the lEC, post implementation of the 
approved Resolution plan and requisite accounting adjustments will be made in the

In view of above, we are unable to comment on the completeness and 
appropriateness of the balances in relation to these subjected matters in the

12.02.2020 by Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) , 
which has been upheld by Hon'ble Allahabad High Court vide its Order dated

authenticity, veracity or completeness of the financial position or performance of the 
Parent for periods prior to the CIRP commencement date.

subjected matters and potential impact of CIRP on any past agreements/decisions 
which are pending implementation/execution, if any, on the Statement.

authorities such as Enforcement Directorate (ED), Economic Offences Wing (EOW), 
Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). 
However, the outcome of such investigations and its effect on the Statement cannot 
be ascertained. 
7. Disclaimer of Conclusion 
In view of the significance of the matters described in paragraph 6 above and the 
uncertainties involved, we have not been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate 
evidence and therefore, unable to conclude as to whether the Statement has been 
prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in 
the applicable Indian Accounting Standard ("Ind AS") specified under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 as amended, read with relevant Rules and other recognized 
accounting practices and policies or state whether the statement has disclosed the 
information required to be disclosed in terms of the Listing Regulation, read with the 
Circular, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any 
material misstatement. 
8. Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern 
We draw attention to Note no. 1 & 2 to the statement regarding the initiation of CIRP in 
respect of the Parent under IBC and related matters. As such, management & 
operations of the Parent are managed by RP on a going concern basis as per provisions 
of IBC. Pursuant to expression of Interest received from Prospective Resolution 
Applicants (PRAs) in response to Form G, the RP has published final list comprising of 
25 entities which have been found eligible PRAs in terms of the lEC RegUlations. The 
Request for Resolution Plans, approved by COC, was issued by RP on 24 April 2025 for 
inviting resolution plans for the Parent. As already disclosed by the Parent on the stock 
exchanges, 5 resolution plans (along with earnest money) had been received by the RP 
in response to the RFRP. Further, based on future cash flows, the financial results of 
the Parent have been prepared on going concern basis but the outcome of events and 
~'\~&AS8a rocesses initiated under CIRP cannot be presently ascertained including matters also 
~ ~ ted hereinbefore. The Parent's ability to remain as going concern depends on the 
::s .TERED ~ ~ 0 TS en ,

outcome of CIRP. Therefore, these events indicate that a material uncertainty exists that 
may cast significant doubt on the Parent's ability to continue as a going concern. 
The Independent Auditors of Kanpur Fertilizers & Chemical Limited (KFCL) 
(subsidiary of the Parent) in its Limited Review report on the standalone financial 
results for the quarter and half year ended on 30th September, 2025 have drawn 
Matters related to Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern 
incorporated/ considered by us as under: 
1. The operation of the Plant of KFCL at Kanpur has been suspended w.e.f 01.04.2025 
due to non-availability of Energy norms which were valid up to 31 8t March, 2025 
and no clarity on revision of fixed cost. These conditions indicate the existence of a 
material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about KFCL's ability to 
continue as a going concern. However, the financial results of KFCL have been 
prepared on a going concern basis.
