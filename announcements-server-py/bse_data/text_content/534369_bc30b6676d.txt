To, 
The Board of Directors of 
TRIBHOV AND AS BHIMJI ZA VERI LIMITED 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of standalone unaudited financial 
results ofTribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri Limited ("the Company") for the quarter and 
half year ended 30th September, 2025 ("the statement"), attached herewith, being 
submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the 
SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (" the 
Regulation"), as amended. 
2. This statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's management and 
·approved by the Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in ac~orda~ce 
with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accountmg 
Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting (Ind AS 34) as prescribed under section 
133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with relevant rules issued thereunder and 
other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to issue 
a report on the statement based on our review. 
3 · We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on 
Review Engagement (SRE) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information 
Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Institute . of 
Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform t?e 
review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the statement is free of matenal 
misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of Company personnel and 
an analytical procedure applied to financial data and thus provides less assurance 
than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do not express 
an-audit ·opinion.

To, 
The Board of Directors of 
TRIBHOV ANDAS BHIMJI ZA VERI LIMITED 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of consolidated unaudited 
financial results of Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri Limited ("the Parent") and its 
subsidiary (the parent and its subsidiary together refer to as "the Group") for the 
quarter and half year ended 30th September, 2025, being submitted by the Parent 
pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligation and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulation, 2015 ('the Regulation'), as amended. 
2. This statement, which is the responsibility of the parent's management and 
approved by the Parent's Board of Directors, has . been prepared in accordance 
with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting 
Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting (lnd AS 34} as prescribed under 
Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with relevant rules issued 
thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our 
responsibility is to express a conclusion on the statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the statement in accordance with the Standard on 
Review Engagement (SRE) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information 
Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information 
consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and 
accounting- matters, -and applying analytical and other review procedures. A 
review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with 
Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance 
_ that we wpuld become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in 
D\ & an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

LEADERSHIP COMMENTARY 
Mr. Sri kant Zaveri, Chairman & Managing Director: 
"Our Q2 and H1 FY26 performance represents the next chapter in the profitable-growth journey we set in motion through 
FY25 and reinforced in Q1 FY26. In this quarter, revenue grew by more than 21% year-on-year while earnings accelerated 
meaningfully faster, with increased gross and EBITDA margins. This is a reflection of how our business model has been 
steadily reshaped through, design-led product mix, sharper merchandising and disciplined execution across our retail 
network. Our flagship showrooms in Ahmedabad and Hyderabad, opened in Q1 FY26, continue to deepen our presence in 
India's most attractive urban corridors and strengthen our brand recall across generations. 
Ms. Binaisha Zaveri, Director: 
"Over recent quarters, our endeavour has been to give TBZ's heritage a contemporary voice by uniting product, store 
experience and storytelling. Within our network of showrooms, each store is curated with regional sensibilities in mind, yet 
consistently reflects our national brand signature of trust and craftsmanship. These efforts translated into a healthy step­
up in customer engagement this quarter, with strong walk-ins, a high proportion of new-customer contribution and a revival 
of lapsed clients. By rooting our growth in design, experience and authenticity, we are steadily strengthening TBZ's position 
as the preferred jewellery destination for bridal, festive and everyday fine jewellery for today's consumers and the 
generations that will follow. 
Mr. Mukesh Sharma, Chief Financial Officer: 
"Our Q2 and H 1 FY26 numbers provide clear evidence that our journey for margin improvement that we have been marching 
towards for the last two years is now firmly embedded in the business. From full-year FY25 EBITDA margins of 6.72% and 
gross margins of 13.66%, we have moved to H1 FY26 EBITDA margin of8.73% and gross margin of 16.53%, alongside double­
digit revenue growth in the early teens. In Q2 alone, revenue grew 21.30%, EBITDA rose 74.15% and PAT grew 132.23%. This 
profit flow-through is a direct outcome of disciplined product and inventory management, procurement efficiencies and 
tight control of operating costs. From a balance sheet perspective, our growth remains largely self-funded. We will continue 
to manage capital prudently, grow revenue with a quality-first mindset and convert scale into cash flows, ensuring that 
margin gains are sustainable and aligned with long-term shareholder interests." 
About Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri Limited 
Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri Limited is India's renowned and trusted jewellery retailer with a legacy of more than 
161 years. The Company began its journey in 1864, opening its flagship store in Zaveri Bazar, M umbai. Over the 
years, the Company has established itself as a preferred choice for customers in the wedding jewellery segment,

being the first jeweller to offer a buyback guarantee on jewellery and to introduce 100% hallmarked jewellery in 
India. The Company transformed from a one-store family-owned business in 1864 into a professional 
organisation led by the 5th generation, expanding its presence and reach across India to 37 stores in 27 cities.
