SUB: COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION 30 OF SEBI (LODR), 2015- NON-FUNDING OF 06TH SEMI 
ANNUAL INTEREST IN ESCROW ACCOUNT MAINTAINED IN BANK OF INDIA WRT MTNL BOND 
SERIES VIIB (INE153A08113) - reg 
Dear Sir, 
Pursuant to Regulation 30 of SEBI (LODR) 2015, We would like to inform you that 06th Semi Annual 
Interest w.r.t. 7.87% MTNL Bond Series VII-B (INE153A08113) is due on 1st December 2025. As per 
the Structured Payment Mechanism of Tri-Partite Agreement (TPA) signed among MTNL, 
Department of Telecommunications (DoT), Ministry of Communications, Government of India and 
Beacon Trusteeship Limited, MTNL has to fund the semi-annual interest into the ESCROW Account 
maintained in Bank of India with adequate amount 10 days before the due date. 
It may also be mentioned that all Bonds issued by MTNL are Sovereign Guaranteed Bonds by 
Government of India. However, in case of any default made by MTNL in payment of Principal and 
Interest on the Bonds issued by it then Sovereign Guarantee will be invoked by the Debenture 
Trustee and the Government of India is obliged to make the payment to MTNL for the same. The 
invocation of Sovereign Guarantee is based on Tripartite Agreements (TPA) entered into between 
Government of India, Debenture Trustee and MTNL which were filed with BSE when Bonds were 
listed. 
In view of above provisions of TPA, it is informed that due to insufficient funds MTNL could not 
fund the ESCROW Account maintained in Bank of India with the adequate amount. 
Kindly take the same on record. 
Thanking You, 
Yours faithfully,
