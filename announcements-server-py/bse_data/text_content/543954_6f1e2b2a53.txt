1. SUMMARY OF PRIMARY BUSINESS  
 
Allcargo Terminals Limited (“ATL”) is a leading provider of integrated logistics solutions for EXIM and domestic 
trade across sea, air and land terminals in India. Established to leverage the growing opportunities in containerized 
trade, ATL operates on an asset-right business model with a focus on efficiency and scalability. 
 
The core operations of ATL consist of a network of Container Freight Stations (CFS) and Inland Container Depots 
(ICD), which act as key extensions of port infrastructure. These facilities provide a wide range of services, including 
customs inspection and clearance, stuffing and destuffing of containers, weighment, storage and other allied logistics 
support, ensuring smooth and timely movement of containerized cargo. 
 
ATL is one of the largest CFS operators in India, with seven strategically located CFS and ICD facilities across major 
ports. With warehousing capacity exceeding one million square feet and the ability to handle over one million TEUs 
annually, the Company combines extensive infrastructure with a digitally enabled, experienced workforce to provide 
seamless, reliable, and scalable logistics solutions. 
 
ATL’s network, operational expertise  and technology-driven approach make it a preferred partner for customers 
across various industries, reinforcing its position as a key player in India’s cargo terminal and logistics sector. 
 
Operational capabilities 
 
Warehousing facilities of ATL are spread over an area of 81,800 sq. mt., including bonded warehouses of 14,900 sq. 
mt. The company offers customized services that include but are not limited to, palletization, packing, labelling, 
stuffing, de-stuffing, storage and examination of import and export bound cargo. Bonded and unbonded warehousing, 
first and last mile delivery, specialized cargo handling and direct port delivery, also form part of the service portfolio. 
There are 269 reefer points available across all locations, offering handling and monitoring of reefer containers. ATL 
also has expertise and experience in handling Over -Dimensional Cargo (ODC) and Hazmat handling. It owns and 
operates state-of-the-art equipment at its CFS facilities to facilitate smooth operations. In addition to the distinction 
of being India's first CFS  to install Rubber -tyred Gantry (RTG) cranes, equipment such as reach stackers, empty 
handler, RTGs, forklifts, trailers, etc. are available at all facilities. All CFSs have Custo ms officers posted and this 
enables smooth cargo examination and clearance. Services for maintenance and storage of empty containers are also 
provided at the CFS facilities.

ATL has a wide pan-India presence, and when combined with a multi-city consolidation network, gives the business 
a strong competitive edge. The company operates 7 CFS and ICD facilities in India, of which 4 are owned and 3 are 
through subsidiaries and Joint Ventures. The company is well-positioned at key ports of JNPT, Mundra, Chennai and 
Kolkata that drive more than 80% of India's container traffic. It is also best placed to capture the ICD opportunity 
driven by the development and forward strides in Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC). The company has the privilege 
of being the market leader in JNPT and Mundra and is among the top three CFSs in Kolkata and Chennai.

SECTION II - RISK FACTORS 
 
 An investment in equity shares involves a high degree of risk. This section describes the risks that we 
currently believe may materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. You 
should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all other information set forth in this Letter 
of Offer, including the risks and uncertainties described below, before making an investment in the Rights 
Equity Shares. 
 
The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks that we currently face. Additional risks 
and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also materially 
adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. If any 
or some combination of the following risks, or other risks that we do not currently know about or believe to 
be material, actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows could 
suffer, the trading price of, and the value of your investment in our equity shares could decline, and you may 
lose all or part of your investment. In making an investment decision, you must rely on your own examination 
of our Company and the terms of this Issue, including the merits and risks involved. 
 
To obtain a complete understanding, you should read this section in conjunction with the section “Summary 
of Letter of Offer” and “Introduction” on pages 15 and 31 respectively of this Letter of Offer. The industry-
related information disclosed in this section has been derived from publicly available documents from 
various sources believed to be reliable, but their accuracy and completeness are not guaranteed, and their 
reliability cannot be assured. N either our Company, nor any other person connected with the Issue have 
independently verified the information in the industry report or other publicly available information cited in 
this section. 
 
Materiality: 
  
The Risk Factors have been determined on the basis of their materiality. The following factors have been 
considered for determining the materiality of Risk Factors: 
• Some events may not be material individually but may be found material collectively; 
•  Some events may have material impact qualitatively instead of quantitatively; and  
• Some events may not be material at present but may have a material impact in future. 
 
The financial and other related implications of risks concerned, wherever quantifiable have been disclosed 
in the risk factors mentioned below. However, there are risk factors where the impact may not be quantifiable 
and hence, the same has not been disclosed in such risk factors. The numbering of the risk factors has been 
done to facilitate ease of reading and reference and does not in any manner indicate the importance of one 
risk over another. In this Letter of Offer, any discrepancies in any table between total and sums of the amount 
listed are due to rounding of. 
 
 
RISK RELATED TO THE OBJECTS 
 
1. Risk Related to rail Connectivity and land acquisition for Inland Container Depot (ICD) at 
Farukhnagar 
 
The development of ICD at Farukhnagar is contingent upon establishing and maintaining reliable rail 
connectivity, acquisition of land and change of land use for industrial purposes. There are inherent 
uncertainties associated with Haryana Orbital Rail Corp oration Limited (HORCL) obtaining necessary 
approvals, clearances, and support from Indian Railways and operationalize the rail connectivity. 
21 
   
 
Additionally, the project’s effectiveness will depend on HORCL & Indian Railways’ infrastructure 
capacity, scheduling, and operational policies, which may be subject to change. Any delays, disruptions, 
or changes in rail connectivity arrangements along wit h delays or obstructions in acquisition of land and 
change of land use for industrial purpose could adversely affect project timelines, the facility’s operational 
efficiency, cargo handling capacity and overall business performance. 
 
2. Risk Related to land conversion at Mundra New CFS Project 
 
The Company is in the process of conversion of land use acquired for the New Mundra CFS to industrial 
use. The timelines and outcome of this process are contingent upon approvals from multiple authorities. 
Any delay or failure in obtaining these approvals may adversely impact project timelines, facility 
operational efficiency, cargo handling capacity and overall business performance. 
 
3. Competition from existing ICDs and FTWZs in North India may affect pricing, customer acquisition, 
and project viability of the ICD Farukhnagar 
 
The presence of existing and potential Inland Container Depots (ICDs), Free Trade Warehousing Zones 
(FTWZs), and other logistics hubs in North India may intensify competition, which could adversely affect 
pricing strategies, customer acquisition efforts, a nd the overall viability and profitability of the ICD 
Farukhnagar project. 
 
4. Economic downturns and trade policy changes may impact demand and profitability. 
 
The operations and financial performance of the proposed ICD and FTWZ facilities are subject to risks 
arising from adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions, including economic slowdowns or recessions. 
Additionally, changes in government trade policies, tariffs, export -import regulations, or geopolitical 
tensions could lead to fluctuations in international trade volumes. Such developments may result in 
reduced demand for logistics and warehousing services, thereby affecting the utilization rates and overall 
profitability of the facilities. 
 
5. The project may face cost overruns due to unforeseen increases in capital and operational expenses, 
impacting financial viability 
 
The development of the ICD at Farukhnagar and expansion of Free Trade Warehousing Zone (FTWZ) in 
Chennai are complex infrastructure projects that are subject to inherent risks. These include potential 
delays and cost overruns arising from various factors such as unforeseen construction challenges , 
disruptions in the supply chain of raw materials and equipment, and the performance or non-performance 
of contractors and subcontractors engaged in the project. Any such delays or increased expenditures could 
adversely impact the timely completion and co mmissioning of the project, which in turn may affect the 
financial performance and return on investment anticipated from these facilities. 
 
6. Technology and Operational Risks 
 
Efficient container handling depends on modern technology and skilled manpower. Failure to adopt 
appropriate technology or manage operational complexities could result in lower productivity, increased 
turnaround times and customer dissatisfaction. 
 
RISK RELATED TO THE BUSINESS 
 
7. Our international operations in Nepal are subject to a number of risks due to applicability of foreign 
law and exposure to foreign currencies. 
22 
   
 
 
Our Company conducts its business operations in Nepal in addition to India, though the exposure to 
revenue through Nepal is not material. The business operations are subject to the internal risks as projected 
in India along with  number of risks, which may arise due to the applicability of foreign laws, foreign 
exchange policies as well as the monetary trend of the applicable currency rate. Any such factors could 
directly or indirectly affect the performance of the Company in Nepal. 
 
8. A downturn in the business performance of manufacturers, retailers and other customers who engage 
logistics service providers directly or indirectly, could adversely affect our business, results of operations 
and financial condition. 
 
The Company’s performance is highly correlated to the performance of the economy. Any macroeconomic 
or microeconomic factors which may affect the business performance of manufacturers, retailers and other 
customers who engage logistics service providers could directly or indirectly affect the performance of the 
Company. 
 
9. Our relationship with shipping lines and customers is also a key factor for successfully running the 
business, our inability to maintain the same could adversely impact the business. 
 
Our success largely depends on the continued services and performance of our management, our 
relationship with shipping lines as well as our customers. The loss of service of the shipping lines could 
seriously impair the ability to continue to manage and expand the business efficiently. Further, the loss of 
any of the customers may adversely affect the operations, finances and profitability of our Company. Any 
failure or inability of our Company to efficiently retain and manage its human resources would adversely 
affect our ability to function and expand our business. 
 
10. We cannot assure to manage or maintain our growth effectively or successfully execute our growth 
strategies, which could affect our operations and financial condition. 
 
Our ability to execute our growth strategy depends upon our ability to manage our teams, manage risk, 
managing customers, continued product/service offering, developing and maintaining our operational base 
and ensuring high service quality. Our failure to do any of these could adversely affect our business and 
financial condition. 
 
11. Difficulty in integration of any recent or future acquisitions could result in adverse effects on the 
business operations and financial condition. 
 
We seek to rely on inorganic growth, among other growth options and intend to evaluate potential 
acquisition opportunities. Integration of acquired operations involve risks including geographical and 
regulatory risks. Our inability to execute a successful integration or identify suitable acquisition 
opportunities could adversely impact our future growth. 
 
 
12. Our business operations are subject to various laws and regulations that require us to renew or obtain 
such approvals from time to time and any failure on our part to comply with the terms of these approvals 
could result in their cancellation, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and 
financial condition. 
 
Our Company requires several approvals, licenses, registrations, and permits, including customs law and 
regulations. Many of these approvals are granted for fixed periods and need renewal from time to time. Our 
Company is required to renew or maybe in the process of renewing such permits, licenses and approvals. 
23 
   
 
There can be no assurance that the relevant authorities will issue any of such permits or approvals in time 
or at all. Further, these permits, licenses and approvals are subject to several conditions, and our Company 
cannot assure that it shall be able to continuously meet such conditions or be able to prove compliance with 
such conditions to statutory authorities, and this may  lead to cancellation, revocation or suspension of 
relevant permits/ licenses/ approvals. Failure by our Company to renew, maintain or obtain the required 
permits, licenses or approvals, or cancellation, suspension or revocation of any of the permits, licenses or 
approvals which may result in the interruption of our Company’s operations and may have  a material 
adverse effect on the business. Further, changes in related laws and regulations may have a material adverse 
effect on the business. 
 
13. Our business requires renewal or entry into leases from time-to time. Any failure on our part to renew 
these may impact the operations and financial condition. 
 
Our operational assets, such as CFS land, building and equipment, are operated by obtaining leases which 
may be granted for fixed period and may require renewal of such leases from time to time. Failure to renew 
such leases may result in adverse impact on the operations. We try to operate by entering into long term 
leases but timely renewal or any cancellation of such leases cannot be guaranteed. 
 
14. Our business faces competition from organized and unorganized logistics providers, which may 
adversely impact our business and financial performance. 
 
The industry, in which we are operating is competitive and our results of operations and financial 
conditions are sensitive to, and may be materially affected by, competitive pricing and other factors. 
Increase of competition from other organized and unorganized logistics players may lead to a reduction in 
revenues, profit margin and a loss of market share. To mitigate this, the Company creates value through 
integrated technology- based solutions, integrated services, customer relationships, and skill development 
of its employees. There can be no assurance that we  can effectively compete with our competitors in the 
future, and any such failure to compete effectively may have a material adverse effect on our business, 
financial condition and results of operations. 
 
15. Our business is subject to operational risks such as breakdown of equipment, accidents, and labour 
disputes. If any of these risks were to materialize, our business and results of operations could be 
adversely affected. 
 
Our service and operations are subject to operating risks, such as the breakdown or failure of equipment, 
power supply or processes, performance below expected levels of output or  efficiency, obsolescence, 
labour disputes, etc. The occurrence of any of these risks could significantly affect our operating results. 
Although we take precautions to minimize the risk of any significant operational problems at our facilities, 
including insurance coverage, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely 
affected by any disruption of operations at our facilities, including due to any of the factors mentioned 
above. 
 
16. Any adverse development affecting the trade volumes and container handling & storage rates may have 
an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
Any adverse change to the trade conditions and container handling & storage rates by government agencies 
or otherwise may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business, raise additional financing, and 
the interest rates and other commercial terms at which such additional financing may be available. 
This could have an adverse effect on our business and future financial performance, our ability to obtain 
financing for capital expenditures and maintain the trading price of our Equity Shares. If economic  
recession or a downturn in our customers’ business cycle cause a reduction in the volume shipped by those 
24 
   
 
customers, our operating results could also be adversely affected. 
 
 
17. Inability to raise capital could impact our operations and financial condition. 
 
We will continue to incur significant capital and operational expenditure to grow our business. We cannot 
assure that we will have sufficient capital to execute the same. While we expect cash on hand and cash flow 
from operations to be adequate to fund our existing commitments, our ability to incur any future 
borrowings is dependent on success of our operations. If we are unable to raise capital in timely and 
adequate manner or on acceptable terms, our operations and future cash flows could be adversely affected. 
 
ISSUE RELATED RISK 
 
18. Sale of Equity Shares by our Promoters or other significant shareholder (s) may adversely affect the 
trading price of the Equity Shares 
 
Any instance of disinvestments of equity shares by our Promoters or by other significant shareholder(s)  
may significantly affect the trading price of our Equity Shares. Further, our market price may also be 
adversely affected even if there is a perception or belief that such sale of Equity Shares might occur. 
 
19. There is no guarantee that our Equity Shares will be listed in a timely manner or at all which may 
adversely affect the trading price of our Equity Shares. 
 
In accordance with Indian law and practice, final approval for listing and trading of the Equity Shares will 
not be granted by the Stock Exchange until after those Equity Shares have been issued and allotted. 
Approval will require all relevant documents au thorizing the issuing of Equity Shares to be submitted. 
There could be a failure or delay in listing the Equity Shares on Stock Exchange. Any failure or delay in 
obtaining the approval would restrict your ability to dispose of your Equity Shares. Further, historical 
trading prices, therefore, may not be indicative of the prices at which the Equity Shares will trade in the 
future which may adversely impact the ability of our shareholders to sell the Equity Shares or the price at 
which shareholders may be able to sell their Equity Shares at that point of time. 
 
20. SEBI has, by way of circular dated March 11, 2025, streamlined the process of rights issues. You should 
follow the instructions carefully, as stated in the SEBI Rights Issue Circular and in this Letter of Offer. 
 
The concept of crediting Rights Entitlements into the demat accounts of the Eligible Equity Shareholders 
has recently been introduced by the SEBI. Accordingly, the process for such Rights Entitlements has been 
devised by capital market intermediaries. Eligible Equity Shareholders are encouraged to exercise caution, 
carefully follow the requirements as stated in the SEBI circular dated March 11 , 2025, and ensure 
completion of all necessary steps in relation to providing/updating their demat account details in a timely 
manner. For details, see “Terms of the Issue” on page 59. 
 
In accordance with Regulation 77A of the SEBI ICDR Regulations read with the SEBI Rights Issue 
Circular, the credit of Rights Entitlements and Allotment of Rights Equity Shares shall be made in 
dematerialized form only. Prior to the Issue Opening Date, our  Company shall credit the Rights 
Entitlements to (i) the demat accounts of the Eligible Equity Shareholders holding the Equity Shares in 
dematerialized form; and (ii) a demat suspense escrow account opened by our Company, for the Eligible 
Equity Shareholders which would comprise Rights Entitlements relating to (a) Equity Shares held in a 
demat suspense account pursuant to Regulation 39 of the SEBI Listing Regulations; or (b) Equity Shares 
held in the account of IEPF authority; or (c) the demat accounts of the Eligible Equity Shareholder which 
are frozen or details of which are unavailable with our Company or with the Registrar on the Record Date; 
25 
   
 
or (d) credit of the Rights Entitlements returned/reversed/failed; or (e) the ownership of the Equity Shares 
currently under dispute, including any court proceedings. 
 
21. The Rights Entitlement of Eligible Equity Shareholders holding Equity Shares in physical form 
(“Physical Shareholder”) may lapse in case they fail to furnish the details of their demat account to the 
Registrar. 
 
The concept of crediting Rights Entitlements into the demat accounts of the Eligible Equity Shareholders 
has recently been introduced by the SEBI. Accordingly, the process for such Rights Entitlements has been 
recently devised by capital market intermediaries. Eligible Equity Shareholders are encouraged to exercise 
caution, carefully follow the requirements as stated in the SEBI circular dated March 11, 2025 and ensure 
completion of all necessary steps in relation to providing/updating their demat account details in a timely 
manner. For details, see “Terms of the Issue” on page 59. In accordance with Regulation 77A of the SEBI 
ICDR Regulations read with the SEBI Rights Issue Circular, the credit of Rights Entitlements and Allotment 
of Rights Equity Shares shall be made in dematerialized form only. 
 
In accordance with the circular SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/DIL2/CIR/P/2020/13 dated January 22, 
2020, the credit of Rights  Entitlement and Allotment  of Rights Equity Shares shall  be made in 
dematerialized form only. Accordingly, the Rights Entitlements of the Physical Shareholders shall be 
credited in a suspense escrow demat account opened by our Company during the Issue Period. The Physical 
Shareholders are requested to  furnish the details of their demat account to the Registrar not later than 2  
(two) Working Days prior to the Issue  Closing Date to enable the credit of their Rights Entitlements in 
their demat accounts at least 1  (one) day before the Issue Closing Date. The Rights Entitlements of the 
Physical Shareholders who do not furnish the details of their demat account to the Registrar within 2 (two) 
Working Days prior  to the Issue Closing Date, shall lapse. Further, pursuant to a press release dated 
December 03, 2018 issued by the SEBI, with effect from April 01, 2019, a transfer of listed Equity Shares 
cannot be processed unless the Equity Shares are held in dematerialized form (ex cept in case of 
transmission or transposition of Equity Shares). 
 
22. Failure to exercise or sell the Rights Entitlements will cause the Rights Entitlements to lapse without 
compensation and result in a dilution of shareholding. 
 
Rights Entitlements that are not exercised prior to the end of the Issue Closing Date will expire and become 
null and void, and Eligible Equity Shareholders will not receive any consideration for them. The 
proportionate ownership and voting interest in our Company of Eligible Equity Shareholders who fail (or 
are not able) to exercise their Rights Entitlements will be diluted. Even if you elect to sell your unexercised 
Rights Entitlements, the consideration you receive for them may not be sufficient to fully compensate you 
for the dilution of your percentage ownership of the equity share capital of our Company that may be caused 
as a result of the Issue. Renouncees may not be able to apply in case of failure in completion of renunciation 
through off-market transfer in such a manner that the Rights Entitlements are credited to the demat account 
of the Renouncees prior to the Issue Closing Date. Further, in case, the Rights Entitlements do not get 
credited in time, in case of On Market Renunciation, such Renouncee will not be able to apply in this Issue 
with respect to such Rights Entitlements. For details, see “Terms of the Issue” on page 
59. 
 
23. Any future issuance of Equity Shares, or convertible securities or other equity-linked securities by our 
Company may dilute your shareholding and any sale of Equity Shares by our Promoter or members of 
our Promoter Group may adversely affect the trading price of the Equity Shares. 
 
Any future issuance of the Equity Shares, convertible securities or securities linked to the Equity Shares by 
our Company may dilute your shareholding in our Company; adversely affecting the trading price of the 
Equity Shares and our ability to raise capital through an issue of our securities. In addition, any perception 
26 
   
 
by investors that such issuances or sales might occur could also affect the trading price of the Equity Shares. 
We cannot assure you that we will not issue additional Equity Shares. The disposal of Equity Shares by 
any of our Promoter and Promoter Group, or the perception that such sales may occur  may significantly 
affect the trading price of the Equity Shares. We cannot assure you that our Promoter and Promoter Group 
will not dispose of, pledge or encumber their Equity Shares in the future. 
 
24. You may be subject to Indian taxes arising out of capital gains on the sale of the Equity Shares. 
 
Under current Indian tax laws, unless specifically exempted, capital gains arising from the sale of equity 
shares of an Indian company are generally taxable in India. Accordingly, you may be subject to payment 
of long-term capital gains tax in India, in addition to payment of STT, on the sale of any Equity Shares 
held for more  than 12 months. STT will be levied on and collected by a domestic stock exchange on 
which the Equity Shares are sold. Further, any gain realized on the sale of listed equity shares held for a 
period of 12 months or less will be subject to short-term capital gains tax in India. Capital gains arising 
from the sale of the Equity Shares may be partially or completely exempt from taxation in India in cases 
where such exemption is provided under a treaty between India and the country of which the seller is a 
resident. Generally, Indian tax treaties do not limit India’s ability  to impose tax on capital gains. As a 
result, residents of other countries may be liable for tax in India as well as in their own jurisdiction on 
gains made upon the sale of the Equity Shares. 
 
25. Holders of Equity Shares could be restricted in their ability to exercise pre-emptive rights under Indian 
law and could thereby suffer future dilution of their ownership position. 
 
Under the Companies Act, any company incorporated in India must offer its holders of equity shares pre-
emptive rights to  subscribe and  pay for a proportionate number  of shares to maintain their  existing 
ownership percentages prior to the issuance of  any new equity shares, unless the pre-emptive rights have 
been waived by the adoption of a special resolution by holders of three-fourths of the shares voted on such 
resolution, unless our Company has obtained government approval to issue without such rights. However, 
if the law of the jurisdiction that you are in does not permit the exercise of such pre-emptive rights without 
us filing an offering document or registration statement with the applicable authority in such jurisdiction, 
you will be unable to exercise such pre-emptive rights unless we make such a filing. We may elect not to 
file a registration statement in relation to pre-emptive rights otherwise available by Indian law to you. To 
the extent that you are unable to exercise pre-emptive rights granted in respect of the Equity Shares, your 
proportional interests in us would be reduced. 
 
EXTERNAL RISK FACTORS 
 
26. Changes in global economic conditions may affect our business operations. 
 
The Company’s business is primarily dependent on Indian EXIM Trade, which, in turn, is dependent on 
global economic conditions. All the factors, which can affect global economic conditions, have direct 
impact on the CFS/ ICD business. Given the projected g rowth in the Indian economy and expected 
recovery in global trade, rising spending in the infrastructure and manufacturing space, it is estimated that 
imports will continue to rise steadily. However, any changes in the economic conditions, which may give 
rise to lowered expectancy of recovery in global trade, may adversely impact the business operations of the 
Company. 
 
27. Risks related to the price and availability of fuel and electricity. 
 
The transportation services in our operations historically have experienced fluctuations driven by volatility 
in fuel and electricity prices and other economic factors beyond our control. The prices and supply of fuel 
27 
   
 
and electricity depend on factors not under our control, including but not limited to general economic 
conditions, global and domestic market prices, competition, production levels, transportation costs and 
import duties, and these prices are cyclical in nature, which would lead to increase in cost and eventually 
affect the profits of the Company. 
 
28. Natural calamities and force majeure events may have an adverse impact on our business. 
 
Natural disasters may cause significant interruption to our operations, and damage to the environment that 
could have a material adverse impact on us. The extent and severity of these natural disasters determines 
their impact on the Indian economy. Prolong ed spells of deficient or abnormal rainfall and other natural 
calamities could have an adverse impact on the Indian economy, which could adversely affect our business 
and results of operations.  
 
29. Political instability or changes in the Government could adversely affect economic conditions in India 
generally and our business in particular. 
 
Our business, and the market price and liquidity of our Equity Shares, may be affected by interest rates, 
changes in Government policy, taxation, social and civil unrest and other political, economic or other 
developments in or affecting India. Elimination or substantial change of policies or the introduction of 
policies that negatively affect the Company's business could cause its results of operations to suffer. Any 
significant change in India's economic policies could disrupt business and economic conditions in India 
generally and the Company’s business in particular. 
 
30. Financial instability in other countries could disrupt Indian markets and our business and cause the 
trading price of the Equity Shares to decrease. 
 
The Indian financial markets and the Indian economy are influenced by the economic and market 
conditions in other countries. Although economic conditions are different in each country, investors' 
reactions to developments in one country can have adverse effects on the securities of companies in other 
countries, including India. A loss of investor confidence in other financial systems may cause volatility 
in Indian financial markets, including with respect to the movement of exchange rates and interest rates in 
India, and, indirectly, in the Indian economy in general. Any such continuing or other significant financial 
disruption could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and the trading price of the Equity 
Shares. 
 
31. There are restrictions on daily / weekly / monthly movements in the price of the Equity Shares, which 
may adversely affect a shareholder’s ability to sell, or the price at which it can sell, Equity Shares at a 
particular point in time 
 
Once listed, we would be subject to circuit breakers imposed by all stock exchanges in India, which 
does not allow transactions beyond specified increases or decreases in the price of the Equity Shares. This 
circuit breaker operates independently of the index-based market-wide circuit breakers generally imposed 
by SEBI on Indian stock exchanges. The percentage limit on circuit breakers is set by the stock exchanges 
based on the historical volatility in the price and trading volume of the Equity Shares. The stock exchanges 
do not inform us of the percentage limit of the circuit breaker in effect from time to time and may change 
it without our knowledge. This circuit breaker limits the upward and downward movements in the price of 
the Equity Shares. As a result of this circuit breaker, no assurance may be given regarding your ability to 
sell your Equity Shares or the price at which you may be able to sell your Equity Shares at any particular 
time. 
 
 
28 
   
 
 
32. The price of our Equity Shares may be volatile, or an active trading market for our Equity Shares may 
not develop. 
 
The trading price of our Equity Shares may fluctuate after this Issue due to a variety of factors, including 
our results of operations and the performance  of our business, competitive conditions, general economic, 
political and social factors, the performance of the Indian and global economy and significant developments 
in India's fiscal regime, volatility in the Indian and global securities market performance of our 
competitors, the Indian capital markets and Finance industry, changes in the estimates of our performance 
or recommendations by financial analysts and announcements by us or others regarding contracts, 
acquisitions, strategic partnership, joint ventures, or capital commitments. 
 
33. Global economic, political and social conditions may harm our ability to do business, increase our 
costs and negatively affect our stock price. 
 
Global economic and political factors that are beyond our control, influence forecasts and directly affect 
performance. These factors include interest rates, rates of economic growth, fiscal and monetary policies 
of governments, inflation,  deflation, foreign exchange fluctuations, consumer credit availability, 
fluctuations in commodities markets, consumer debt levels, unemployment trends and other matters that 
influence consumer confidence, spending and tourism. Increasing volatility in financial markets may cause 
these factors to change with a greater degree of frequency and magnitude, which may negatively affect our 
stock prices. 
 
34. Terrorist attacks, civil unrests and other acts of violence or war involving India or other countries could 
adversely affect the financial markets, our business, financial condition and the price of our Equity 
Shares. 
 
Any major hostilities involving India or other acts of violence, including civil unrest or similar events that 
are beyond our control, could have a material adverse effect on India's economy and our business. Such 
acts could negatively impact business sentiment as well as trade between countries, which could adversely 
affect our Company's business and profitability. Additionally, such events could have a material adverse 
effect on the market for securities of Indian companies, including the Equity Shares. 
 
35. Taxes and other levies imposed by the Government of India or other State Governments, as well as other 
financial policies and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial 
condition and results of operations. 
 
Taxes and other levies imposed by the Central or State Governments in India that affect our industry 
include GST, income tax and other taxes, duties or surcharges introduced on a permanent or temporary 
basis from time to time. Imposition of any other taxes by the Central and the State Governments may 
adversely affect our results of operations. Similarly, continued availability of tax holidays and tax credits 
offered by the Central or State Governments may affect our financial condition. 
 
36. Any downgrading of India’s debt  rating by an  independent agency may harm our ability to raise 
financing. 
 
Any adverse revisions to India's rating by an independent international rating agency may adversely affect 
our ability to raise additional financing due to increased interest rates and stringent commercial terms at 
which such additional financing is available. This could have an adverse effect on our ability to fund our 
growth on favourable terms  or at all, and consequently adversely affect our business and financial 
performance and the price of our Equity Shares. 
29 
   
 
 
37. Our operations are dependent on the performance of the Indian economy and securities market.  
 
The growth in our business has been directly related to the growth in the Indian economy. There have been 
periods of slowdown in the economic growth of India or periods where inflation was high. Such economic 
growth is affected by various factors including domestic consumption and savings, balance of trade 
movements, namely export demand and movements in key imports (oil and oil products), global economic 
uncertainty and liquidity crisis, volatility in exchange currency rates, and annual rainfall, which aff ects 
agricultural production. Any slowdown or reversal in the growth of the Indian economy could result in a 
reduction in wealth in the Indian economy that can be diverted to savings and investment, a reduced interest 
in investment in the securities market and reduced foreign investment. Additionally, an increase in India’s 
trade deficit, a downgrading in India’s sovereign debt rating or a decline in India’s foreign exchange reserves 
could negatively impact interest rates and liquidity, which could adversely impact the Indian economy and 
our business. Any adverse revisions to India’s sovereign debt ratings may also adversely affect our ability to 
raise additional financing and the interest rates and other commercial terms at which such additional 
financing is available. This could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of 
operations and our ability to obtain refinancing, as well as the trading price of the Equity Shares. 
 
38. Risk related to adverse Climatic Conditions 
 
The Company’s core business comprises a network of Container Freight Stations (CFS) and Inland Container 
Depots (ICD). Adverse climatic conditions, including heavy rainfall, cyclones, flooding, or heat waves, may 
impact the Company’s operations. Such events could disrupt transportation networks, damage infrastructure, 
delay cargo handling, and affect overall supply chain efficiency. Prolonged adverse weather conditions may 
also lead to increased operational costs and hinder the Company’s ability to meet customer commitments in 
a timely manner 
 
OTHER DISCLOSURES  
 
1) Our Company has been in compliance in all material respects with the following since listing on Stock 
Exchanges (August 10, 2023):

2) Our Company has an investor grievance -handling mechanism which includes meeting of the 
Stakeholders’ Relationship Committee at frequent intervals, appropriate delegation of power by our

BASIS / RATIONALE FOR PRICE 
 
The Issue Price of ₹20 per Equity Share has been determined by the Board of Directors after due consideration of 
various qualitative and quantitative factors such as prevailing market conditions, industry trends, and the financial 
position and future prospects of the Company. 
 
The logistics sector, and particularly the Container Freight Station (CFS) business, continues to witness fluctuations 
arising from changes in global trade volumes, freight rates, and regulatory developments. Considering these sectoral 
dynamics and with an objective to strengthen the Company’s capital base to support its ongoing and future business 
initiatives, the Board has deemed it appropriate to offer the Equity Shares at a price that is both attractive and 
equitable. 
 
Accordingly, the Issue Price of ₹20 per Equity Share has been fixed to provide an opportunity to the existing 
shareholders to enhance their participation in the Company’s growth at a price lower than the prevailing market 
price, while ensuring that the pricing remains fair, reasonable, and in the overall interest of the shareholders and the 
Company. 
 
Investors should read the above-mentioned information along with “Risk Factors” and “Financial Information” on 
pages 20 and 52 respectively, to have a more informed view.

Rights Equity Shares either in full or in part and also to the Renouncee(s) who has or have applied for Rights 
Equity Shares renounced in their favour, in full or in part. 
 
(b) Eligible Equity Shareholders whose fractional entitlements are being ignored and Eligible Equity 
Shareholders with zero entitlement, would be given preference in allotment of one Additional Rights Equity 
Share each if they apply for Additional Rights Equity Shares. Allotment under this head shall be considered 
if there are any unsubscribed Rights Equity Shares after allotment under (a) above. If number of Rights 
Equity Shares required for Allotment under this head are more than the  number of Rights Equity Shares 
available after Allotment under (a) above, the Allotment would be made on a fair and equitable basis in 
consultation with the Designated Stock Exchange and will not be preferential allotment. 
 
(c) Allotment to the Eligible Equity Shareholders who having applied for all the Rights Equity Shares offered 
to them as  part of this Issue, have also applied for Additional Rights Equity Shares. The Allotment of such 
Additional Rights Equity Shares will be made as far as possible on an equitable basis having due regard to the 
number of Equity Shares held by them on the Record Date, provided there are any unsubscribed Rights Equity 
Shares after making full Allotment in (a) and (b) above. The Allotment of such Rights Equity Shares will be 
at the sole discretion of our Board or its Rights Issue Committee in consultation with the Designated Stock 
Exchange, as a part of this Issue and will not be a preferential allotment. 
 
(d) Allotment to Renouncees who having applied for all the Rights  Equity Shares renounced in their favour , 
have applied for Additional  Rights Equity Shares provided there is surplus available after making full 
Allotment under (a), (b) and (c) above. The Allotment of such Rights Equity Shares will be made on a 
proportionate basis having due regard to the number of Rights Entitlement held by them as on Issue Closing 
Date and in consultation with the Designated Stock Exchange, as a part of this Is sue and will not be a 
preferential allotment. 
 
(e) Allotment to Specific Investor, if any, as disclosed by our Company before opening of the Issue, or to any 
other person, as deem fit by our Board, provided there is surplus available after making Allotment under (a), 
(b), (c) and (d) above, and the decision of our Board in this regard shall be final and binding. 
 
After taking into account Allotment to be made under (a) to (e) above, if there is any unsubscribed portion, the same 
shall be deemed to be ‘unsubscribed’.

RESTRICTIONS ON FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF INDIAN SECURITIES 
 
   Foreign investment in Indian securities is regulated through the Industrial Policy, 1991, of the Government of 
India and FEMA. While the Industrial Policy, 1991, of the Government of India, prescribes the limits and the 
conditions subject to which foreign investment can be made in different sectors of the Indian economy, FEMA 
regulates the precise manner in which such investment may be made. The Union Cabinet, as provided in the 
Cabinet Press Release dated May 24, 2017, has given its approval for phasing out the FIPB. Under the Industrial 
Policy, 1991, unless specifically restricted, foreign investment is freely permitted in all sectors of the Indian 
economy up to any extent and without any prior approvals, but the foreign investor is required to follow certain 
prescribed procedures for making such investment. Accordingly, the process for foreign direct inv estment 
(“FDI”) and approval from the Government of India will now be handled by the concerned ministries or 
departments, in consultation with the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, Ministry of 
Commerce and Industry, Government of India (formerly knows as the Department of Industrial Policy and 
Promotion) (“DPIIT”), Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs,  FIPB section,  through a 
memorandum dated June 5, 2017, has notified the specific ministries handling relevant sectors. 
 
   The Government has, from time to time, made policy pronouncements on FDI through press notes and press 
releases. The DPIIT issued the Consolidated FDI Policy Circular of 2017 (“FDI Circular 2017”), which, with 
effect from August 28, 2017, consolidated and superseded all previous press notes, press releases and 
clarifications on FDI issued by the DPIIT that were in force and effect as on August 28, 2017. The Government 
proposes to update the consolidated circular on FDI policy once every year and therefor e, FDI Circular 2017 
will be valid until the DPIIT issues an updated circular.  
 
  The Government of India has from time to time made policy pronouncements on FDI through press notes and 
press releases which are notified by RBI as amendments to FEMA. In case of any conflict between FEMA and 
such policy pronouncements, FEMA prevails. The Consolidated FDI Policy, issued by the DIPP, consolidates 
the policy framework in place as on August 27, 2017, and supersedes all previous press notes, press releases 
and clarifications on FDI issued by the DIPP that were in force and effect as on August  27, 2017. The 
Government proposes to update the consolidated circular on FDI Policy once every year and therefore the 
Consolidated FDI Policy will be valid until the DIPP issues an updated circular. 
 
   Under the FDI Policy, unless specifically restricted, foreign investment is freely permitted in all sectors of the 
Indian economy up to 100% without any prior approvals, however the foreign investor must follow certain 
prescribed procedures for making s uch investment. Accordingly, the process for foreign direct investment 
("FDI") and approval from the Government of India will now be handled by the FIFP. 
 
  The transfer of shares between an Indian resident and a non-resident does not require the prior approval of the 
RBI, provided that (i) the activities of the investee company falls under the automatic route as provided in the FDI 
Policy and FEMA and transfer does not attract the provisions of the SEBI Takeover Regulations; (ii) the non- 
resident shareholding is within the sectoral limits under the FDI  Policy; and (iii) the pricing is in accordance 
with the guidelines prescribed by SEBI and RBI. 
 
   As per the existing policy of the Government of India, erstwhile OCBs cannot participate in this Issue. OCBs 
or Overseas Corporate Bodies have been derecognised as a class of investor entity in India with effect from 
September 16, 2003. 
 
   The above information is given for the benefit of the Applicants / Investors. Our Company is not liable for any 
amendments or modification or changes in applicable laws or regulations, which may occur after the date of 
this Letter of Offer. Investors are advised to make their independent investigations and ensure that the number
