Independent Auditors’ Review keport 
The Board of Directors 
Century Extrusions Limited 
1. We have reviewed the accompanyir.g statement of standalone unaudited financial results of 
Century Extrusions Limited (“the Company”) for the quarter and half year ended September 
30,2025 (“the Statement”), being submitted by the Company pursuant to Regulation 33 of the 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, as amended from time to time. We have initialed the Statement for 
identification purposes only. 
2. This Statement which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and approved by 
the Company’s Board of Directors has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial 
Reporting” (“Ind AS - 34") notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with 
relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. 
Our responsibility is to issue a report on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
This standard requires that we pian and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as 
to whether the Statement is free from wicterial misstatement. A review is limited primarily to 
inquires of Company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus, 
provides less assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we 
do not express an audit opinion. 
4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us 
to believe that the accompanying Statement of the unaudited financial results read with notes 
thereon, prepared in accordance with aforesaid Indian Accounting Standards and other 
recognized accounting practices and policies generally accepted in India, has not disclosed 
the information required to be disciosed in terms of the Regulation 33 of the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (Listing Gbligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015, as amended from time to time, inciuding the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or 
that it contains any material misstatement.
