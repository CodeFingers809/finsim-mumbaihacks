Independent Auditor's Review Report on Review of Interim Financial Results 
To The Board of Directors of 
Citichem India Limited 
We have reviewed the accompanying statement of Unaudited Financial Results of Citichem India 
Limited ('The Company") for the half year ended 30th September 2025 ('the statement'), being 
submitted by the company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the SEBI ( Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015. 
This statement is the responsibility of the Company's Management and has been approved by the 
Board of Directors / Committee of Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to issue a report on 
these financial statements based on our review. 
We conducted our review in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagement (SRE) 2410, 
'Rev iew of Interim Financial Information Performed by Independent Auditor of the Entity' issued by 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform 
the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of company personnel & analytical 
procedures applied to financial data and thus provide less assurance than an audit. We have not 
performed an audit and accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
Based on our review conducted as above nothing has come to our notice that causes us to believe 
that the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results prepared in accordance with the 
applicable Indian Accounting Standards as prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 
2013, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 
33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 including the 
manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
