as regulator backs revocation". 
With regard to the media article, we would like to clarify about the business undertaken by the Company: 
Inox Green Energy Services Limited ("IGESL's") business model is related to the O&M of renewable power 
projects. IGESL presently has - 12.5 GW of renewable assets under management, including investments for 
controlling 6.5 GW of wind O&M assets, IGESL is on course to become India's largest renewables 0&M 
Company.

Regulatory Commission ("CERC") dated ip November, 2025 upholding the disconnection of grid access 
for 300 MW wind project by Central Transmission Utility of India Limited ("CTUIL") ("Event") is not a 
material event for the Company as the primary business of the Company is operation and maintenance of 
renewable power assets and has no material financial impact on the revenues as well as the future guidance 
of the Company. 
In this regard, the Company will like to place on record the following facts regarding the said development 
including the pointwise clarification: 
Whether such negotiations/ events were taking place? If so, you are advised to provide the said 
information along with the sequence of events in chronological order from the start of negotiations/

Gujarat.

- However, CTUIL's inter-connecting common evacuation infrastructure, which was originally 
scheduled to be commissioned from 23rd November, 2019, got actually charged after a delay of more

costs of WTGs and project infrastructure. Further, there were massive delays in land allotment 
exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, which were beyond the control of IGESL.

2025.
