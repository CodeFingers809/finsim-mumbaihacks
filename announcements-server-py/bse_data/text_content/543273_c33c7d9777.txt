Press Release 
SECOND LONG-TERM ORDER TOWARDS GREEN AND SUSTAINABLE FUTURE 
Mumbai, India, November 19, 2025: - Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works Limited 
(“KMEW”) (BSE: 543273) (NSE: KMEW) is pleased to announce that it has secured its 
second order for a state-of-the-art Green Tug, marking another significant milestone in 
the company’s commitment to sustainable maritime solutions and long-term service 
excellence. The newly awarded contract spans a duration of 15 years, reinforcing the 
trust and confidence placed in KMEW’s technical capability, operational performance, and 
innovation-driven approach. The said Letter of Award is issued by Visakhapatnam Port 
Authority for “Manning, Operation, Maintenance and Complete Technical Management of 
contractor Owned 01 No. ASTDS-GTTP Tug” at a value of ₹ 384.33 Crores (Rupees Three 
Hundred Eighty Four Crores and Thirty Three Lakhs) including taxes for a period of 15 
years.  
This achievement reflects KMEW’s visionary efforts in promoting environmentally 
responsible marine operations. The Green Tug—designed with advanced battery operating 
systems with zero-emission technology—aligns with global initiatives toward greener 
shipping and supports the client’s long-term sustainability goals. 
The second order follows the company’s successful ongoing management of the first green 
tug, making KMEW a forerunner in green maritime transformation in India. With in depth 
knowledge of battery management system, KMEW will deploy the same high-efficiency 
energy architecture in the second tug to ensure optimal reliability, safety, and lifecycle 
performance.” 
The second order placed by Govt of In
dia on KMEW proves its operational performance in 
of India’s Green Tug Transmission Programme, reinforcing the company’s position at the 
forefront of the nation’s maritime decarbonization efforts.  
With this repeat order, KMEW will realize significant synergy  benefits in capital 
expenditure through consolidated, multi-unit procurement with key vendors. Bulk 
ordering enables more favorable pricing, streamlined logistics, and standardized 
component configurations across vessels. In parallel, the replication of engineering, 
integration, and project-management workflows across both tugs reduces overhead costs 
by minimizing design iteration, shortening build cycles, and optimizing resource 
allocation. These combined efficiencies strengthen overall project economics and enhance 
scalability for future green-tug deployments. 
With this win, KMEW has demonstrated its position as a fully qualified and capable 
contender in the green-tug segment, establishing a strong track record for participation in 
upcoming government and private green-tug tenders. This achievement positions the 
company to compete effectively in a rapidly expanding market estimated at approximately 
₹
12,000 crore, driven by national decarbonization goals and increasing demand for low-
emission harbor and coastal support vessels.

About Green Tug Transition Program (GTTP) India has launched the Green Tug Transition Program (GTTP), a pioneering initiative to decarbonize its maritime sector by replacing diesel-powered harbor tugs with zero-emission alternatives. Under the first phase, running from October 2024 to December 2027, major ports in India will deploy green tugs powered by electricity and alternative fuels, significantly reducing carbon emissions and marine pollution. With an investment of ₹10,000 crore, the program positions India as a global leader in sustainable port operations and supports the nation's broader climate goals. By replacing diesel-powered tugs with zero-emission alternatives, the initiative directly contributes to lowering greenhouse gas emissions and curbing air and water pollution in coastal regions. This shift not only supports India’s nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement but also sets a precedent for sustainable innovation in marine logistics, reinforcing the country’s commitment to climate resilience and environmental stewardship. The Maritime India Vision 2030 (MIV 2030) in 2020 — (a ten-year blueprint outlining India’s roadmap for a sustainable maritime sector and a vibrant blue economy) identifies key interventions to position India as a global leader in safe, sustainable, and green maritime operations. Among its core goals are increasing the share of renewable energy to 60% of total power demand across major ports through green energy, achieving a 30% reduction in carbon emissions per ton of cargo handled by 2030, and transitioning at least 50% of port vehicles to cleaner fuels. Complementing this effort, the “Harit Sagar” Green Port Guidelines further emphasize the adoption of cleaner, greener propulsion systems for port crafts and vessels, reinforcing India’s commitment to achieving a low-carbon and environmentally responsible maritime ecosystem. All Major Ports of India are mandated to call for tenders of Green Tugs under GTTP for a period of 15 years. Authorities such as Deendayal Port, Jawaharlal Nehru Port, Paradip Port, V.O. Chidambaranar Port, New Mangalore Port, Visakhapatnam Port have floated tenders for Green Tug. Several reputed private shipbuilders and public sector undertakings (PSUs) are actively participating in these tenders to align with the Indian Government’s initiative of adopting new and advanced technologies in the maritime sector. Among them, KMEW has expressed strong interest in participating in such initiatives, with a long-term perspective of building a sustainable 15-year business model. This engagement not only provides KMEW with opportunities for steady growth but also positions the company as a key contributor to the Government’s drive toward green energy and environmentally responsible maritime development. KMEW remains committed to adopting new technologies and integrating sustainable resources into its vessels and operational practices, reflecting its core ethos of innovation and environmental stewardship.

Commenting on the Letter of Award, Mr. Sujay Kewalramani, CEO of Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works Ltd said that,  Securing the second green-tug order under a long 15-year operating period is a strategic milestone for KMEW and a strong validation of our technology, reliability, and execution capability. This contract extends our leadership in India’s maritime decarbonization journey and reinforces the confidence that our partners place in our high-efficiency battery management systems, operational safety standards, and life-cycle cost performance. This achievement strengthens KMEW’s credibility with port authorities, shipyards, and maritime regulators, positioning the company to competitively participate in future large-scale decarbonized-vessel tenders. It also underscores KMEW’s capability to deliver integrated electric-propulsion systems, high-reliability battery management solutions, and sustainable vessel-lifecycle support—key differentiators as India accelerates its transition toward cleaner maritime infrastructure. This back to back 15 Years contracts win shows Company’s sustainability in the business and growth. This project aligns seamlessly with the Maritime India Vision 2030 and the country’s climate commitments under the Paris Agreement, and we are honored to be at the forefront of this transformation. The construction of Two Green Tugs together will help us in leveraging construction and procurement synergies that directly lower capex costs. On the operational side, replicating proven engineering designs and integration workflows significantly reduces project-management overheads.
