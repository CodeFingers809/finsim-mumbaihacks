Rationale and key rating drivers 
Revision in ratings assigned to bank facilities  of The Waterbase Limited (TWL) is considering continuous subdued financial 
performance in FY25 (refers to April 01 to March 31) and H1FY26 with the company incurring cash loss. The subdued performance 
over recent quarters is attributed to the decline in the company’s operational performance marked by lower capacity utilisation 
(CU) of the shrimp feed unit. Ratings revision further considers the increased debt level and reduction in liquidity buffer available 
with the company.  
 
However, ratings continue to derive strength from the experience of its promoters with long track record of company’s operations 
in the shrimp feed industry and it being a part of the Karam Chand Thapar (KCT) group. Ratings also factor the partially integrated 
nature of its operations with an established brand presence and marketing network, company’s comfortable capital structure with 
nil term debt, and its adequate liquidity. Additionally, ratings also take cognisance of initiatives taken by the company f or 
diversification of its revenue by venturing in processing shrimps on their own instead of third-party processing, farm care products, 
and frozen sea food. Ratings continue to remain constrained by the exposure to raw material price volatility , geographical 
concentration of revenue and risks inherent to the seafood industry. Ratings further continue to remain constrained by the 
exposure to raw material price volatility, geographical concentration of revenue and risks inherent to the seafood industry and 
working capital intensive operations.  
 
Rating sensitivities: Factors likely to lead to rating actions 
Positive factors 
• Ability to sustain scale of operations and improvement in profitability with profit before interest, lease rentals, 
depreciation and taxation (PBILDT) margin above 4% on a sustained basis. 
• Ability to maintain its healthy leverage while sustaining improvement in operating cycle at less than 90 days. 
 
Negative factors  
 
• Continued losses resulting in further deterioration in debt coverage indicators and liquidity profile. 
• Any major debt-funded capex resulting in deterioration in capital structure. 
 
Analytical approach: Standalone 
 
Outlook: Stable  
The ‘Stable’ outlook assigned to TWL’s long -term rating considers the company’s strong leverage position with expectation of 
improvement in total operating income (TOI)  and reduction of loss in the medium term and availability of need -based support 
from the KCT group. 
Detailed description of key rating drivers: 
 
Key strengths 
Experienced promoters with long track record in the shrimp feed industry

2 CARE Ratings Ltd. 
 
Press Release  
TWL has long track record of over three decades in the shrimp feed industry. It is a part of the KCT group, which is spearheaded 
by Vikramaditya Thapar and his son, Varun Aditya Thapar. Vikramaditya Thapar has been in the shrimp feed industry for almost 
three decades and thus has long experience in the seafood business. The promoter group is well supported by e xperienced 
personnel. KCT group has interests in sectors ranging from coal logistics, real estate, and aquaculture. 
 
Partially integrated operations with strong brand and established marketing network  
TWL is predominantly a shrimp feed manufacturer with a processing facility for shrimp. The company has increased its integration 
and presence in the value chain post commencement of hatchery with 250 million post larvae capacity from October 2018. The 
company sells shrimp feeds under the brands, Bay White -Advanced, Maximy, Tiger XL , and Vanamax. It sells shrimp feeds 
characterised by high quality, freshness, appropriate calorific value, and rich in nutrients through an established network of over 
164 dealers primarily in the country’s coastal areas. TWL enjoys long-standing relationship with its network of dealers with top 10 
customers contributing ~39% sales in FY25 and ~36% sales in H1FY26. 
 
Diversification into farm care products and frozen sea food 
TWL had diversified its product offering through launch of its farm care range of products under the brand , Baylife, and frozen 
sea food products (processed shrimps and pasteurised crab meat) under the brand , Prize Catch. Contribution from farm care, 
processing and hatchery business improved to over 50% of TOI in FY25 and H1FY26 against ~43% in FY24.  
 
Comfortable capital structure  
Overall gearing remains comfortable at 0.28x as on March 31, 2025 (0.15x as on March 31, 2024). The company does not have 
term debt on its books. The borrowing of TWL comprises only working capital borrowings , which has increased in FY25 and 
H1FY26 owing to operating losses. The average working capital limit utilisation for the last 12 months ended October 31, 2025 , 
was ~47%, which provides cushion to its liquidity. 
 
Liquidity: Adequate 
TWL had liquidity in the form of cash and cash equivalents of ₹10.98 crore as on March 31, 2025, out of which ₹10.51 crore has 
been pledged against bank guarantee and sanctioned working capital limits. The company does not have term debt on its books 
and moderate working capital limit utilisation. The average working capital limit utilisation for the last 12 months ended October 
31, 2025, was ~47%, which provides cushion to its liquidity. 
 
Key weaknesses 
Subdued financial performance in FY25 and H1FY26 
TOI moderated from ₹339.25 crore in FY24 to ₹277.89 crore in FY25, due to decrease in shrimp feed sales by ~35% in FY25. 
The reduction in sales volume was due to change in credit policy by TWL from credit to cash and carry model. In H1FY26, TOI 
grew by ~25% over H1FY25 driven by increased revenue from processed shrimp segment, while revenue from feed business 
witnessed decline of ~20%. The company continues to incur operating loss in FY25 and H1FY26 in view of low CU leading to 
under absorption of fixed ove rheads. The CU of the shrimp feed unit of TWL continued to remain low at ~13% in FY25 and 
H1FY26 (~20% in FY24). The CU for processed shrimp unit was moderate at ~57% in FY25 (~53% in FY24) and improved 
significantly in H1FY26 to ~87%. On an overall basis, profitability margin is expected to remain under pressure in FY26. 
 
Working capital intensive operations 
The company’s operations are working capital intensive considering credit period offered to dealers and stocking of raw materials 
(depending on prevailing market prices). There was slight deterioration in operating cycle in FY25 to 124 days (112 days in FY24) 
because of decrease in average creditors’ period and increase in inventory holding period. However, the company has recovered 
its receivables from Gujarat region in FY24 and FY25 and reduced its outstanding debtors to ₹41.18 crore as on March 31, 2025, 
against ₹86.63 crore as on March 31, 2023. In H1FY26, the operating cycle improved slightly to 98 days.  
 
Volatility in raw material prices 
Raw materials’ cost constitutes major portion of the company’s cost of sales (~71% in FY25 against ~74% in FY24). The major 
raw materials are agro products , such as soya, wheat flour , and fish meal. Other raw materials include fish oil, mono -calcium 
phosphate, minerals, Vitamin C, and binders, among others. Since availability of major raw materials is seasonal and depends on 
climatic conditions, the raw material costs are volatile. The  company has limited ability to pass on the increase in raw material 
prices. There has been significant increase in the soya and fish meal prices in the past few years, which have however moderated 
in FY25 and have remained stable in H1FY26.  
 
Geographical concentration risk in an intensively fragmented and competitive market  
 
3 CARE Ratings Ltd. 
 
Press Release  
TWL derives 48% of its revenue from exports of processed shrimp with majority exports to China and Belgium. While domestic 
market contributes 52% of revenue driven by shrimp feed segment. The feed industry is driven by regional demand and supply 
because of transportation constraints and perishable products. TWL’s domestic sales remain geographically concentrated with 
~75-80% of contribution from Andhra Pradesh. The company has lower presence in other geographies such as Tamil Nadu, 
Maharashtra, West Bengal, and Odisha. Low capital intensity and low entry barriers facilitate entry of unorganised players, leading 
to high competition and fragmentation. Though the organised market is dominated by few major players in the shrimp feed 
segment, the higher capacity in the industry compared to demand leads to intense competition. 
 
Risks inherent in the seafood industry 
The main threat to shrimp industry is from outbreak of diseases. The Indian shrimp exports industry is highly fragmented give n 
the low entry barriers and significant competition in the export market from other competing countries and threat from other 
seafood varieties. Government policies keep varying depending on other macroeconomic factors such as anti -dumping duties, 
and inflation among others, which increase expenses of the companies operating on the seafood industry. The prospects of shrimp 
feed business remain linked to the shrimp industry’s performance.
