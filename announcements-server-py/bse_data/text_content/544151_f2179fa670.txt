Update on New Manufacturing Units, Allana Joint Venture and Business Expansion Plans 
 
The following updates regarding Chatha Foods Limited (“the Company”) manufacturing capacities, 
product development progress, and business expansion initiatives: 
 
The Company has made significant progress in its expansion across two new plants and both 
the plants are expected to commission by January 2026 as detailed herein. Post the expansion, 
the consolidated food processing capacity of the Company will increase from 7840 MT p.a. to 
>30,000MT p.a. and drive significant growth in revenue and profitability in financial year 2027. 
 
The Company has also been expanding client base beyond QSRs and has hired dedicated team 
for HoReCa, Modern Trade, E-Commerce and General Trade segment.  
 
1. Commissioning of Vegetarian Foods Manufacturing Unit and Product Development  
 
The Company confirms that its new Vegetarian Foods Unit, fully owned by Chatha Foods Ltd., is 
scheduled to be commissioned by January 31, 2026, and will be commercially operational by the  
second week of February 2026. 
  
This facility, with an annual production capacity of 1 6,000 MT, will manufacture frozen flatbreads, 
vegetarian snacks, ready-to-cook gravies and sauces, and ready-to-eat rice, catering to QSR, HoReCa, 
own-brand D2C, and export markets. 
 
The Company has successfully completed extensive product development and benchmark pricing in 
a specially designed pilot -scale plant, enabling faster transition to commercial production upon 
commissioning. Categories initially developed include: 
 
Flatbreads (Tortilla, Malabari Paratha, Roti Canai, Stuffed Parathas), Frozen Pizza Dough (Classic, 
Multigrain), Vegetarian Snacks (Samosas, Kachori, Bhaajis, Tikkis, Kebabs ), Ready-to-Eat (RTE) 
which includes  Gravy bases , Biryani Base s and Ready-to-Eat Rice  for all the focussed markets 
mentioned above 
 
Given the completion of R&D and pilot-scale optimization, the commercial turnaround time for each 
category will be significantly reduced once the plant becomes operational. 
 
Chatha Foods is currently in the trial phase with a leading QSR chain for Tortillas and Frozen Pizza 
Dough, supporting new menu development opportunities. Sampling for flatbreads, gravies, and rice 
is also ongoing with additional QSR clients.
