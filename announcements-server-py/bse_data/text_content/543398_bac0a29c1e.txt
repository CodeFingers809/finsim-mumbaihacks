About this report
BUILT ON STANDARDS. 
STRUCTURED  
FOR SIMPLICITY.
We are delighted to present Latent View 
Analytics Limited’s 2nd Sustainability 
Report, covering the reporting period from 
April 1, 2024 to March 31, 2025 (FY25). 
While this is only our 2
nd formal publication, 
it reflects a long-standing mindset. 
Sustainability has always been embedded 
in our DNA, long before it became a formal 
disclosure.
This report reinforces our commitment to delivering 
insights that drive positive impact; not just for our 
clients, but also for our people, communities, and the 
planet. As a global digital analytics company, we believe 
that data is a powerful instrument for good, and we’re 
using it to inform decisions, drive accountability, and 
build a better tomorrow.
Aligned with our theme for this year ‘Purpose-led. 
People-centric. Planet-conscious’, this report details 
how we’re living that philosophy across every facet 
of our operations. From enabling client outcomes 
with data-led solutions to nurturing an inclusive and 
future-ready workforce and reducing our environmental 
footprint, we are focused on creating long-term, 
sustainable value for all stakeholders.
Reporting framework and structure
This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI 2021 
Universal Standards: ‘With Reference’ option , reflecting our 
continued commitment to globally recognized sustainability 
reporting practices. It follows the core GRI principles of 
materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context, 
and transparency, ensuring we communicate with both clarity 
and credibility.
To reflect a triple-bottom-line approach combined with ESG 
framework, the report is structured into four key sections:
•
 E
conomic - Showcasing how we drive responsible and 
resilient business performance
• E
nvironmental - Detailing our climate action, resource 
efficiency, and de-carbonization initiatives
• S
ocial - Highlighting our employee engagement, inclusion, 
diversity and community impact efforts
• G
overnance - Reflecting our ethical foundation, risk 
management, and compliance track record
All 12 of our material topics , as defined through stakeholder 
consultations and materiality analysis, are addressed under 
these four pillars.
Reporting boundary
The scope of this report includes LatentView’s global 
operations , spanning 11 offices worldwide. The operations 
of the recently acquired Decision Point Private Limited and 
its subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to as Decision Point) 
are not yet included in the FY25 reporting boundary, as 
their integration is ongoing. Future reports will reflect their 
integration.
Independent assurance
We have engaged Bureau Veritas, a leading third-party 
assurance provider, to conduct limited assurance on carbon 
emissions. Their independent verification enhances the 
reliability and accountability of our data.
Please refer to page 43 of this report for the assurance 
statement and scope of the assured metrics.
Corrections and restatements
This report follows the same GRI 2021 standards as our 
inaugural edition. There is one correction though in the data 
disclosed in our previous Sustainability Report.
We welcome your feedback
This is only the 2 nd year we are reporting publicly on our 
sustainability performance, and we are committed to 
releasing annual updates hereafter. We deeply value your 
feedback, as it helps us learn, adapt, and better align our 
actions with stakeholder expectations.

CREATING VALUE 
THAT STANDS  
THE TEST OF TIME
Venkat and 
Pramad 
Founders
Dear All,
Sustainable growth has been a conscious choice for us since our 
inception. It is in the deliberate decisions we make when it comes 
to providing actionable insights to our clients, using technology 
purposefully, growing our business responsibly, and building a 
culture of commitment among our people.
While our values of shared responsibility for the planet are 
ingrained in the way we work, FY25 marks an important step in our 
sustainability journey with this first Global Sustainability Report. 
As we take stock of how far we’ve come, it also brings into focus 
how far we aim to go. This report reflects not just metrics and 
milestones but our mindset — one that is embedded in long-term 
thinking, systemic value creation, and a shared purpose.
The growing alignment between financial prudence and 
sustainability imperatives continues to strengthen our conviction. 
Responsible profits allow us to reinvest in creating shared value 
through planet-conscious infrastructure, inclusive people practices, 
and a business approach that considers the well-being of all 
stakeholders, not just shareholders. This underlines our integrity 
and social responsibility. These values build trust, long-term 
relationships, and meaningful contributions to society.
This year marked a critical leap in operationalizing our ethos. We 
laid the groundwork to expand our reporting scope from India to 
include all global operations, indicating the international footprint of 
our business and our commitment to holistic accountability.
To make our objectives stronger, we finalized the KPIs and targets 
of 12 material topics across economic, environmental, social, 
and governance pillars. This marks a transition from principle to 
practice, bringing rigor, transparency, and continuous improvement 
into every dimension of our ESG journey.
As we continue to grow, our physical spaces reflect our purpose. In 
every location we operate globally, we strive to choose sustainable 
spaces and thoughtfully design interiors that align with our 
young athletes from equity-challenged communities a platform to 
develop their skills, build confidence, and pursue their passion for 
the sport. Our other flagship educational initiative, Project Apoorva, 
plays a pivotal role in empowering students from low-income 
backgrounds by offering them certifications in data analytics that 
open pathways to brighter futures.
Underpinning all of this is our governance approach, which is 
centered around a constant reaffirmation of shared responsibility 
and building a culture of empowerment.
Our principles hold us accountable to a discipline that shapes a 
resilient, equitable, and environmentally conscious world: for our 
people, our clients, our communities, and the planet. We are proud 
of our teams, grateful for our partners, and optimistic about the 
future we are co-creating.
As we look ahead, we remain committed to pushing the boundaries 
of what’s possible and creating lasting value for all.
With warm regards,
Inclusion, for us, is a 
continuous journey of 
listening and learning. 
Just as we strive to build 
an inclusive workplace, we 
are equally committed to 
extending that impact to 
the communities around us.
environmental values. We believe that sustainability can coexist 
with scalability.
The transformation of our Chennai office captures this ethos. 
Far from a routine upgrade, the renovation was envisioned as a 
blueprint for sustainable, future-ready workspaces. Every aspect  
of the design was approached with an ecological vision.
F
rom incorporating biophilic design principles that foster a 
connection to nature, to maximizing natural light and installing 
low-energy lighting systems, as well as deploying energy-
efficient HVAC systems and sensor-activated water fixtures, 
the space is engineered for minimal environmental impact 
and maximum comfort. Universal accessibility is woven into 
the layout, ensuring inclusivity at every step. The space is an 
embodiment of our values, thoughtfully crafted with innovation 
in design to inspire collaboration, promote wellness, and lead by 
example in building a low-carbon, people-centric future.
Our people power our purpose. Being recognized as a Great 
Place to Work
® for the third year in a row and featured among 
India’s Best Workplaces for Women highlights our ecosystem of 
inclusion, engagement, and care. With a 36% diversity ratio and 
33% representation of women on our Board, we are proud of the 
progress we’ve made. But we know there is always more to do.
Inclusion, for us, is a continuous journey of listening and learning. 
Just as we strive to build an inclusive workplace, we are equally 
committed to extending that impact to the communities around 
us. Our CSR programs continue to scale real impact. In FY25, we 
touched the lives of 65,000+ beneficiaries through ₹27 million in 
CSR initiatives.
From setting up sensory rooms in government-aided schools 
to running after-school learning centers and flood mitigation 
initiatives, we believe in co-creating value with communities. 
Our flagship project, Chennai Kaalpandhu League, a grassroots 
football development initiative in government schools, provides

GROWTH 
AS A FORCE 
FOR GOOD
Dear stakeholders,
At LatentView, we believe that sustainability is not a siloed strategy; 
it is the soul of how we operate in a data-driven world that demands 
action and accountability in equal measure.
As we harness the power of analytics every day, I see a future where 
every data point we analyze, every solution we design, and every 
relationship we build leads to responsible and resilient outcomes, not 
only for our clients but also for society and the planet. 
FY25 was a defining year, not just in terms of the performance 
metrics, but also in the purpose, precision, and progress we brought 
to every decision. It saw us crossing key financial milestones. We 
crossed the $100 million revenue threshold, marking a 32% year-on-
year growth, alongside a healthy EBITDA of ₹1,957 million and PAT 
of ₹1,735 million. This growth has helped us invest in what matters: 
innovation, environmental responsibility, people development, and 
social impact.
With this outlook, we ensured that the 440+ high-impact solutions 
delivered during this period were embedded with innovation at every 
stage. Our Service Delivery Excellence (SDE) framework, with its 
feedback loops, performance audits, and methodology refinement, 
ensures that we stay agile, transparent, and client-aligned.
The confluence of growth and sustainability comes to life in our 
Chennai headquarters. Our recently renovated premises have been 
designed with an eco-vision, keeping in mind optimal circulation 
space and using eco-certified interiors, as well as reused and 
recycled materials. It is an example of innovation in design that 
ensures 80% of occupied areas have quality views to exterior spaces. 
The sustainability-first interventions also include the use of low-
GWP refrigerants aligned with global climate protocols and indoor 
air-quality sensors that ensure healthier spaces. In addition, we have 
achieved a 100% transition to energy-efficient LED lighting across all 
our global offices. 
The Chennai office is located within the first EDGE Zero Carbon 
Certified facility in India, which represents the gold standard in 
green infrastructure. The campus has a Zero Liquid Discharge 
approach that ensures that 100% of the water used is treated and 
recycled, thanks to the advanced STP systems. Our renovated 
office supports this through features like sensor-based faucets, 
dual-flush toilets, and touch-free hygiene infrastructure that 
enhance both water efficiency and user safety. 
We believe in responsible waste management starting with waste 
segregation at the source, and have fostered a culture where our 
people actively make it happen. Our partnership with ITC’s WOW 
initiative for paper and carton reuse is another example of this 
ethos in action. From eliminating single-use plastics to adopting 
reusable cutlery and compostable packaging, we have put the 
measures in place, but it is our employees’ everyday choices and 
actions that turn these measures into a living, circular, low-waste 
mindset that defines our infrastructure and culture. 
We take pride in cultivating a workplace where growth, equity, 
and well-being go hand in hand. Our learning ecosystem - from 
technical certifications and leadership bootcamps to behavior-
focused training - is designed to help every individual advance 
with confidence. Our flagship programs, like STEP (Stride Towards 
Excellence) and Rising Star, are helping to build our future 
leadership pipeline.
In FY25, we onboarded 372 new team members and clocked 
200,000+ learning hours, reflecting our shared hunger for 
continuous improvement. But skill-building is only part of the 
story. We believe that true inclusion is built into the fabric of the 
workplace. Accessible infrastructure, gender-neutral restrooms, 
and in-house wellness campaigns ensure that every employee can 
thrive. 
Wellness at LatentView is multi-dimensional, with the PRANA 
program addressing mental, emotional, physical, financial, and 
social well-being through initiatives that promote mindfulness, 
financial literacy, inclusivity, and community-building events. 
This commitment to well-being extends beyond our offices into 
the communities we serve. This year, we impacted thousands 
of individuals through our CSR initiatives, led by our people and 
supported by seven NGO partners. Our employees get involved in 
every aspect of conducting the Chennai Kaalpandhu League, which 
is a medium for school engagement and holistic development 
while fostering grassroots football talent in government schools. 
They also come together to shape our other flagship initiative, 
Project Apoorva, which provides data analytics certification to 
underserved children. In addition, our impact areas spanning 
education, livelihood, and environmental sustainability are all 
powered by active and involved employee collaboration.
As we grow, our values are anchored in strong governance. Trust 
is the foundation of our digital work and we treat data privacy and 
cybersecurity as non-negotiable responsibilities. Through the FAIR 
methodology and SAFE Security CRQM, we’ve enhanced real-time 
visibility into cyber risks, enabling ESG-aligned transparency and 
measurable financial impact. We have also enhanced our threat 
response capabilities through the deployment of Zscaler and instituted 
a dedicated hotline for security incident reporting. Our compliance 
with ISO 27001, ISO 27701, GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS remains robust. 
Our Board and governance committees have been proactive in 
embedding ESG oversight into core operations, ensuring every 
stakeholder interaction is grounded in transparency, accountability, 
and ethics.
Looking ahead, we remain steadfast in driving sustainability, creating 
workplaces that inspire, advancing innovations that power low-carbon 
futures, and growing responsibly, ethically, and inclusively.

INTENTION.
As a company rooted in data and driven by 
purpose, we recognize that every decision we 
make, from the models we build to the offices 
we power, has a broader impact. In a world 
shaped by climate urgency, social expectations, 
and a demand for responsible business, we are 
clear-eyed about our role: to lead with integrity, 
act with empathy, and build with intention.
As we deepen our commitment to becoming a purpose-led, 
people-centric, and planet-conscious enterprise, sustainability 
is not just a standalone initiative. It is embedded in our long-term 
strategy, shaping how we engage with our stakeholders, deliver 
on business goals, and create shared value for society.
Built on strong foundations
We believe that true sustainability lies at the intersection of 
environmental stewardship, social empowerment, and strong 
governance. Guided by these pillars, we are creating long-term 
value for all stakeholders - clients, employees, communities, 
investors, and the planet.

Ethical governance
Our Board of Directors plays a pivotal 
role in steering our sustainability agenda. 
Their oversight ensures our decisions 
are transparent, data-informed, and 
aligned with stakeholder interests. Robust 
governance enables us to meet regulatory 
requirements while driving long-term 
impact.
What matters most
In FY23, we conducted a detailed 
materiality analysis to identify and 
prioritize ESG topics most relevant to our 
stakeholders and our business. These 
material issues lie at the heart of our 
sustainability priorities.
This year, following our inaugural India-
centric sustainability report last year, 
we have expanded our scope to include 
all global offices. 
We are also finalizing formal KPIs and 
targets to track our progress with 
enhanced transparency. We will continue 
engaging with internal teams and external 
partners to ensure our priorities reflect 
evolving expectations and emerging risks.
Our sustainability objectives
We approach sustainability holistically, balancing 
environmental, social, and economic imperatives 
through concrete, measurable actions.
Environmental impact
Our goal is to operate with minimal environmental 
footprint while championing innovations that are 
better for the planet. Key areas of focus include:
• T ransitioning to renewable energy
• I
mproving energy and water efficiency
• M
inimizing waste and adopting circular 
practices
• I
nvesting in green technologies and 
infrastructure
Social responsibility
For employees: We foster an inclusive, 
transparent, and empowering workplace that 
nurtures talent, values diversity, and ensures 
equitable growth through fair policies and 
meaningful upskilling.
For communities: We support societal upliftment 
through CSR programs focused on education, 
digital literacy, and social well-being, monitored 
rigorously for accountability and impact.
Economic value creation
We strive to deliver consistent, responsible 
business performance that benefits all 
stakeholders. Our long-term success is defined 
not just by what we earn, but how we earn it - 
ethically, sustainably, and inclusively.

LISTENING WITH PURPOSE. 
ACTING WITH CLARITY.
Identifying and engaging key 
stakeholders
Our stakeholder identification and engagement process is 
both inclusive and structured. Guided by the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) Standards and our own values, we identify key 
stakeholder groups based on their influence on, and interest in, 
our business. 
Through consultations such as surveys, interviews, focus 
groups, and one-on-one meetings, we capture a 360-degree 
view of their expectations. This insight informs our materiality 
assessment and shapes our Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) priorities.
Our key stakeholder groups include:
• Em ployees  - the backbone of our innovation and delivery
• Cu
stomers - the partners in our value creation journey
• S
hareholders and investors - the custodians of our long-
term strategy
By maintaining consistent dialogue and integrating feedback 
across our decision-making processes, we ensure stakeholder 
priorities are embedded in our business and sustainability 
decisions.
Structured platforms and engagement
We have institutionalized a robust engagement framework 
to address stakeholder concerns through formal and 
informal channels. From town halls and annual reports to 
digital platforms and feedback sessions, each channel is an 
opportunity to build trust and foster mutual understanding.
As part of our materiality assessment, feedback gathered 
from stakeholders is presented to relevant Board sub-
committees. This ensures that the most pertinent social, 
environmental, and economic topics are elevated to strategic 
discussions. At our Annual General Meetings, shareholders 
engage directly with our leadership, closing the loop with 
transparency and accountability.
Co-creating a more inclusive tomorrow
Our CSR initiatives are deeply stakeholder-led. With 
employee involvement and community feedback woven 
into the implementation process, these programs target 
vulnerable groups with measurable outcomes. By focusing 
on education, employability, and holistic development, we are 
not only uplifting individuals but also enhancing our social 
license to operate.
Whether through scholarships, skills training, or nutrition 
support, every initiative is guided by the insights we gather. 
Career counseling for underserved students, for instance, 
was launched based on real-time feedback highlighting a 
need for direction and mentorship. 
Our stakeholder engagement philosophy stems 
from the belief that true progress is collaborative. 
We are committed to building a sustainable 
future, one shaped not only by data and analytics 
but also by dialogue, transparency, and trust. 
Engaging with our stakeholders helps us stay aligned with their 
evolving expectations, manage risks proactively, and identify 
emerging opportunities. This ongoing engagement is especially 
critical as a publicly listed company where accountability and 
inclusiveness go hand in hand.

IDENTIFYING WHAT 
MATTERS MOST
In an increasingly complex and interconnected world, staying 
relevant requires more than just reacting to change; it demands 
anticipating what matters most. At LatentView, materiality is 
more than an exercise; it’s an ongoing commitment to align our 
sustainability agenda with the evolving needs of our stakeholders 
and the rapidly shifting external environment.
In FY23, we undertook a comprehensive materiality assessment 
to identify and prioritize the environmental, social, economic, and 
governance issues that are most significant to our business and 
our stakeholders. This analysis continues to guide our sustainability 
strategy today, forming the backbone of how we navigate risks, 
create long-term value, and make meaningful progress toward our 
purpose-led, people-centric, and planet-conscious vision.
During FY25, we finalized the KPIs and  
targets for our material topics to strengthen  
our sustainability performance framework.
Our materiality assessment approach
We followed a structured and stakeholder-informed process to 
conduct our materiality analysis. The assessment was anchored 
in international frameworks such as the Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI) and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and 
benchmarked against peers, customers, and industry leaders in 
the data and analytics ecosystem.
The steps included:
• I dentifying relevant topics based on global frameworks, 
regulatory updates, and sustainability trends
• E
ngaging stakeholders through surveys, interviews, and 
consultations, to capture a broad range of perspectives
• A ssessing impact and influence, evaluating how each topic 
affects our business and how important it is to our stakeholders
• P rioritizing issues based on relevance, urgency, and potential 
impact
• A
ligning with business strategy, ensuring each topic connects 
back to our long-term goals and sustainability vision
A foundation for focused action
Our materiality framework helps guide our sustainability priorities by 
identifying the issues that matter most to our stakeholders and our business. 
These topics shape the way we design programs, track progress, and share 
our results, ensuring clarity and accountability.
This is an ongoing process. It evolves with our business, our people, and the 
operating environment. In this way, we remain focused on the issues that 
matter most, creating impact that is relevant, practical, and sustainable.
Our material priorities
We identified 12 material topics, each representing 
a vital aspect of sustainability that impacts our 
business and stakeholders. These are:
Each of these topics contributes to 
our broader ambition of embedding 
sustainability into every layer of our 
operations - from how we manage 
energy and emissions, to how we treat 
our people, protect customer data, and 
contribute to societal well-being.

5 Social responsibility (Local communities)
3 Diversity and inclusion
6 Talent attraction and retention
7 Training and upskilling

Stakeholder-driven and future-focused
Our materiality assessment is built on the insights of those who matter most 
- our employees, clients, investors, and community partners. Their feedback 
helped refine our understanding of what truly matters and where our efforts 
can be most effective.
This year, we reassessed the relative importance of each material topic 
based on emerging trends and peer benchmarking. Two key shifts 
reflect our deepening sustainability maturity:
• T he relevance of ‘carbon emissions’ has increased from 4 to 5, 
reflecting the rising urgency to act on climate
• ‘
Diversity and inclusion’ moved from medium to high priority, 
highlighting our commitment to inclusive growth and workplace 
equity

FINANCIAL STRENGTH 
AS A FORCE FOR GOOD
Strong financial performance is not just a measure of success, it is 
an enabler of long-term sustainability. A robust economic foundation 
allows us to serve our stakeholders better, power our growth engines 
responsibly, and drive transformative change in the data analytics 
ecosystem. 
In FY25, we continued to reinforce this foundation by delivering 
consistent, future-focused results while embedding sustainability 
into our operations.

Economic performance : Strive to maintain steady revenue 
and profitability, even in volatile macroeconomic conditions
Customer satisfaction: Loyalty, trust, and referrals from our 
clients are vital drivers of long-term financial stability
Innovation: New ideas, technologies, and data solutions fuel 
our competitive edge and open new frontiers of growth, both 
for us and for those we serve
Being purpose-led means pursuing profitability not in 
isolation, but in alignment with the well-being of people 
and the planet. A people-centric mindset ensures our 
growth translates into opportunities for our employees, 
customers, and communities. And being planet-
conscious encourages us to reinvest our resources into 
environmentally responsible innovations that reduce 
our footprint while amplifying our impact.

Economic performance
PROSPERITY SHARED. 
PROGRESS MULTIPLIED.
Economic performance is not just about financial metrics, it’s 
about shared value. We view business success through a broader 
lens, one that balances profitability with long-term impact for our 
stakeholders and the ecosystem we serve.
In FY25, we demonstrated strong economic resilience and 
continued to outperform in a dynamic global environment. With our 
data-first mindset, strategic foresight, and consistent execution, 
we achieved Revenue from Operations of ₹8,478 million, marking a 
growth of over 32% from the previous year.
We also generated ₹1,305 million in net cash 
flow from operations, up ₹151 million from 
FY24, strengthening our ability to reinvest in 
innovation, people, and community impact.
Equitable value distribution
True to our belief in stakeholder capitalism, we measure 
success by how equitably we distribute value across our 
ecosystem. We are committed to sharing the wealth we 
generate, empowering employees, rewarding shareholders, 
collaborating with partners, and uplifting communities.
We do not view financial health in isolation from our ESG 
responsibilities. It is our belief that profits made responsibly 
can, and must, be reinvested for maximum positive impact.
In FY25, the economic value distributed increased to ₹7,460 
million, up from ₹5,557 million in FY24. These numbers 
speak not just about our financial health, but also about our 
intentional efforts to create a ripple effect of positive impact 
across the value chain.
The backbone of sustainable practices
The economic performance leads to long-term value 
creation, for our shareholders, our clients, our people, and 
society at large. By generating robust revenues and healthy 
profitability, we create a self-sustaining cycle of reinvestment 
into sustainable practices, social initiatives, and green 
innovations.
Our steady economic performance allows us to:

ontribute meaningfully to reduce our carbon footprint

consistency

BUILDING BONDS, 
NOT JUST 
BUSINESS
As a purpose-led, people-centric, and planet-conscious 
company, we believe that delivering lasting impact begins 
with building deep, trusted relationships with our clients. By 
consistently delivering value, ensuring customer data privacy, 
and embracing proactive communication, we strive to not 
only meet but exceed expectations.
Customer satisfaction is a critical pillar of our sustainability 
agenda. It influences retention, fuels innovation, and 
strengthens our reputation across industries - from 
technology and consumer packaged goods to financial 
services and retail. 
Zero customer complaints, data breaches, or 
service disruptions during FY25 is a tribute to 
our commitment to excellence, transparency, 
and trust.
Voices that guide us. Feedback that 
shapes us.
We believe that the most successful partnerships are built 
on listening. Our Voice of Customer (VoC) survey, conducted 
biannually by our dedicated Service Delivery Excellence 
(SDE) team, gives clients the opportunity to share candid 
feedback. 
In our latest VoC cycle, 93% of respondents rated our 
partnership as satisfactory or highly satisfactory, and 
we recorded a recommendation score of 8.3/10 with a 
Net Promoter Score (NPS) of +41, all of which are strong 
indicators of brand loyalty and delivery excellence.
Empowering proactive service
Customer engagement at LatentView is never reactive. We have 
implemented structured mechanisms for capturing feedback and 
handling concerns through multiple channels. Whether it's through 
business reviews, digital platforms, or direct communication, 
every interaction is treated with integrity and urgency.
Our Service Delivery Excellence (SDE) function further 
strengthens this approach by:
•
 D
riving standardization and operational efficiency across 
projects
• S
haring cross-functional success stories to replicate proven 
methodologies
• C
onducting quality audits and performance reviews to elevate 
team productivity
These steps help ensure that client concerns are not only 
heard but resolved swiftly, fostering a culture of ownership and 
responsiveness.
Communicating with clarity
We understand that our clients rely on us to deliver consistently, 
even during uncertain times. That’s why we maintain a proactive 
communication strategy, especially during service disruptions, 
customer complaints, or risk events. We inform clients in real time, 
outlining the issue, the resolution timeline, and mitigation steps. 
This transparency not only upholds trust but also reinforces our 
reputation as a dependable, value-driven partner.
Satisfaction that sustains
Customer satisfaction is at the intersection of experience, 
performance, and purpose. It directly influences our long-term 
success and strengthens our ability to serve a broader mission. 
Happy customers create lasting value.
As we continue to evolve our offerings, including AI-driven 
enhancements for client feedback analysis, we remain focused on 
delivering insight-driven, secure, and personalized experiences.
These insights are not taken lightly. Post-survey, our SDE team 
synthesizes the feedback into actionable plans, working closely 
with client teams to address specific areas for improvement. This 
continuous feedback loop ensures that our engagements remain 
aligned with evolving expectations, while embedding excellence 
into every deliverable.
Trust is built on data privacy
In a digital-first world, data privacy and cybersecurity are 
non-negotiable. As an ISO 27001:2018 certified company, 
LatentView adheres to the highest standards of data protection 
and regulatory compliance. We follow a comprehensive Privacy 
Policy aligned with the EU General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR), ensuring that client data is handled with transparency, 
accountability, and care.
Our cybersecurity and privacy framework outlines:
•
 Se
cure collection, storage, and use of personal data
• C
lear articulation of user rights and data handling practices
• R
obust measures to mitigate data-related risks and ensure 
business continuity
Throughout FY25, we recorded zero data privacy issues, 
cybersecurity incidents, or regulatory penalties, highlighting 
the effectiveness of our risk management protocols and our 
unwavering commitment to client trust.

SOLVING REAL-
WORLD PROBLEMS
In a world shaped by constant digital disruption and climate urgency, 
our commitment to purpose-led innovation empowers us to address 
tomorrow’s challenges today. For us, innovation fuels sustainability, 
enabling smarter decision-making, greener operations, and inclusive 
outcomes.
At the heart of our strategy is the conviction that innovation should 
not only accelerate business performance but also drive meaningful 
societal impact. Whether we're unlocking insights through artificial 
intelligence, designing sustainable business solutions, or nurturing 
human ingenuity, we innovate with intention and impact.
In FY25, delivered 440+ high-impact solutions and 
insights, accelerating innovation and delivering 
measurable client value.
From predictive intelligence to generative 
breakthroughs
As a forward-thinking data analytics company, we’ve long 
harnessed the power of artificial intelligence (AI) - across 
descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive layers of analytics. Today, 
we’re pushing the boundaries by actively exploring Generative 
AI and Agentic AI solutions that move beyond experimentation to 
real-world impact, to reimagine client value, elevate experiences, 
and future-proof our capabilities.
The acquisition and integration of Decision Point has further 
sharpened our AI capabilities, enriching our solution-ing depth 
while expanding our innovation bandwidth across multiple industry 
verticals. 
Every breakthrough begins with a curious 
mind
At LatentView, we firmly believe that people are the engines of 
innovation. Every employee is empowered to ideate, iterate, and 
innovate, not as an add-on, but as part of their core role.
We encourage intrapreneurship among our employees so that 
all employees can bring their ideas directly to the table instead 
of leaving and starting their own business. We always set up an 
internal innovation team that can work to refine their ideas and act 
as a sounding board.
Innovation, embedded into execution
Our Service Delivery Excellence (SDE) framework fuels our 
innovation engine. Designed to evolve with client needs, the SDE 
model drives continuous improvement, identifies transformation 
opportunities, and fosters client-centric innovation.
By integrating client feedback into every iteration, SDE helps us 
co-create solutions that are not only technically sound but also 
strategically aligned. Whether it is process innovation, cross-
pollination of methodologies, or next-gen analytics models, our 
SDE approach ensures we’re always one step ahead.
Capital investments that matter
Innovation also finds expression in how we enable our people and 
equip our workplace. We have made significant capital investments 
to completely redesign our office, embedding sustainability 
principles across energy efficiency, water conservation, and waste 
management. Some specific changes that create more healthier, 
inspiring and innovation-enabling spaces for our teams included:
• E rgonomic chairs and height-adjustable desks to promote 
physical well-being
• T
raining room upgrades for better learning experiences
• D
esk exercise bikes to encourage micro-movement during 
work hours
• B
etter lighting solutions to reduce energy use while creating 
brighter, more productive spaces
• I
ntroduction of green plants across the workplace to enhance 
air quality, well-being, and creativity
These improvements demonstrate our commitment to health-
positive, inclusive, and sustainable work environments, where 
people can thrive and ideas can flourish.

Every footprint 
matters
While our core operations as a data analytics company have a 
relatively lower environmental impact compared to resource-
intensive sectors, we understand that every footprint matters.
In today’s dynamic global context, marked by climate change, 
resource scarcity, and ecosystem degradation, we are acutely 
aware of our role in shaping a greener, more resilient future. Our 
approach to environmental responsibility is not about checking 
boxes; it’s about choosing better every day - better processes, 
better practices, and better outcomes for the planet.
As a digital-first organization, we are not dependent 
on fossil fuel-based manufacturing or extractive 
resources. However, this does not exempt us from 
responsibility. Rather, it positions us to lead by 
example - utilizing data, insights, and purposeful 
design to cultivate climate-conscious  
workplaces and practices.

EFFICIENT BY DESIGN. 
RESPONSIBLE BY CHOICE.
Sustainability begins with the choices we 
make every day, and energy is one of our most 
conscious ones. As a data-driven organization, 
we understand that how we consume energy 
directly shapes our environmental footprint. 
That’s why we’ve made energy management a 
foundational pillar of our sustainability strategy.
Our approach is deeply intentional, built around measurable 
outcomes and reinforced by smart infrastructure and 
employee awareness.
2-pronged energy strategy
Energy efficiency and renewable energy are not an afterthought, 
they are engineered into our workspace design. Our headquarters 
at Chennai incorporates:
Eco-friendly refrigerants: All HVAC systems operate on CFC- and 
HCFC-free refrigerants, minimizing environmental impact while 
maintaining high performance.
Energy metering and monitoring: Sub-meters and continuous 
monitoring systems are in place to track consumption patterns 
and drive data-led efficiency improvements.
Efficient lighting design: LED lighting across facilities delivers 
at least a 30% reduction in Lighting Power Density compared to 
conventional standards.
Smart sensor systems:  Motion sensors are installed in all 
occupied areas, while daylight sensors along building façades 
maximize natural light use and reduce unnecessary energy load.
On-site renewable energy: We are working toward a target where 
at least 12% of our total energy requirements are met through on-
site renewable generation.
High-efficiency appliances:  All equipment and appliances used 
are Energy Star or BEE 3-star rated, reinforcing our commitment 
to sustainable consumption.
These choices reflect our belief that even in an industry not 
directly reliant on resource-heavy infrastructure, we still carry an 
environmental responsibility, and we act on it with focus. Similarly, 
our global offices extend this commitment, which is detailed in the 
‘green building practices’ section below.

CLEANER CHOICES.  
GREENER FUTURE.
Our commitment to a sustainable planet is deeply 
embedded in how we operate, design, and scale our 
systems. As a purpose-led and planet-conscious data 
analytics company, we understand that reducing carbon 
emissions is not just a regulatory necessity, but a collective 
responsibility to future generations.
While our business may not be resource-intensive 
in the traditional industrial sense, we recognize 
the importance of minimizing our climate 
impact through deliberate and forward-thinking 
environmental practices. Our carbon reduction 
strategy is rooted in innovation, powered by data, 
and brought to life by our people.

EFFICIENCY FUELS 
SUSTAINABILITY
We understand that every drop counts. Even though 
our operations are not water-intensive, we treat water 
as a precious shared resource and make every effort to 
manage it with care and foresight. 
As a purpose-led and planet-conscious 
organization, we strive to reduce our water 
footprint through thoughtful infrastructure 
upgrades, responsible practices, and a 
conservation-focused culture. This is how we turn 
everyday choices into long-term impact.
Water management
Our water conservation strategy begins with deploying 
technology to make consumption smarter and leaner. Across 
our offices, we’ve installed a wide range of water-efficient 
fixtures, including sensor-activated faucets, dual-flush 
toilets, and health faucets fitted with aerators. These 
installations are designed not just to reduce wastage but 
also to ensure hygiene, especially in high-traffic common 
areas. We also use recycled water for flushing, further 
reducing our reliance on freshwater resources.
Furthering our commitment, restrooms across facilities are 
equipped with touch-free sensor taps to minimize usage and 
encourage water-conscious behavior. Beyond functionality, 
our inclusive restroom facilities are also designed for 
universal accessibility, ensuring sustainability extends to 
inclusivity.
We believe that creating a culture of conservation is 
as crucial as the infrastructure itself. We are actively 
addressing this through internal campaigns that promote 
water-sensitive behaviors, both at work and beyond. 
From informational signage in restrooms to digital 
communication campaigns, we continuously encourage our 
teams to conserve water as part of their everyday routine.
At our Chennai location, we operate within an IT park that 
houses a state-of-the-art ZLD facility. This cutting-edge 
infrastructure includes a dedicated Sewage Treatment 
Plant (STP), ensuring that 100% of wastewater generated is 
treated and recycled within the premises. We use recycled 
water for flushing, further reducing our dependence on 
freshwater resources. No liquid effluents are discharged 
externally, reinforcing our commitment to environmental 
stewardship.
This closed-loop system not only enables efficient 
water recycling but also eliminates the need for external 
water transportation, thereby reducing the greenhouse 
gas emissions associated with water procurement and 
disposal. In essence, the ZLD facility helps us balance 
sustainability with operational efficiency.

As a data-driven and purpose-led organization, we 
recognize that how we manage our waste today will 
define the environmental legacy we leave tomorrow. We 
fully understand the growing environmental risks posed 
by global waste generation, especially e-waste, which is 
uniquely relevant to the IT and analytics industry. 
Waste management
Small changes lead to significant impact. In FY25, we scaled 
several initiatives to reduce everyday waste generation:
Single-use plastic was eliminated in our canteen, replaced 
by reusable sustainable cutlery reducing dependence on 
disposables
Disposable paper cups were phased out, with more eco-
friendly options introduced
Waste from carton boxes and newspapers is now disposed 
through ITC’s ‘Well-being Out of Waste (WOW)’ initiative, 
promoting circular economy practices
Each of these choices not only reduces landfill pressure 
but also strengthens our resolve to be an eco-conscious 
workplace.

Our waste management efforts go beyond systems. 
They are driven by people. Through internal campaigns, 
signage, and peer advocacy, we cultivate a workplace 
culture that values thoughtful consumption and 
responsible disposal. Employees are encouraged to 
participate actively in recycling programs and educated 
about the environmental impacts of their daily habits.
Creating a culture of conscious consumption
Sustainable choices at the workplace
Our waste management philosophy is rooted in the 3R 
approach - Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. Whether it is food waste 
in the pantry or e-waste from servers and systems, we aim 
to manage every stream responsibly.
In FY25, we strengthened our tracking and reporting 
efforts to measure the types and quantities of waste 
generated, thus laying the foundation for better planning 
and performance benchmarking in the years ahead.
From awareness to action
As global waste challenges continue to escalate, we 
remain focused on circular thinking, transforming 
what was once waste into a potential resource. 
Whether through reusing office infrastructure during 
renovations or sourcing recycled materials for acoustic 
panels, our approach is holistic and future-facing.
A circular mindset for a linear challenge
Electronic waste, though often invisible in daily operations, 
poses one of the most significant environmental threats 
in our industry. We manage it head-on by partnering with 
authorized recyclers who comply with Pollution Control 
Board (PCB) norms, ensuring responsible handling and 
recovery of metals, plastics, and other materials.
All e-waste, from cables to cartridges, is sorted and 
processed through designated bins and handed over for 
recycling in accordance with the highest environmental 
standards. This mitigates the risk of hazardous substances 
such as mercury and lead entering the ecosystem.
E-waste: Responsible recycling 
with certified partners
Key focus areas (other than material issues)
We follow a structured, outcomes-focused approach  
to manage waste:
1. Track
Measure and monitor waste at the source
Maintain digital logs for accountability
 
2. Segregate and dispose
Source-level segregation into food, plastic, and paper
Special bins for e-waste placed strategically  
(restrooms, UPS room, etc.)
S
afe handover to certified vendors for responsible disposal
 
3. Use eco-friendly alternatives
Shift to sustainable materials and long-lasting products
Eliminate items with short life cycles or  
high ecological impact
Our 3-pronged strategy
For each category of waste generated, total waste 
recovered through recycling, re-using or other recovery 
operations (in metric tonnes)
By nurturing this culture, we empower every LatentView 
employee to be a sustainability ambassador, on campus 
and beyond.

A CUL TURE WHERE EVERY 
VOICE COUNTS
In a world defined by complexity, the most powerful 
insights emerge when diverse minds come together. Our 
inclusive culture strengthens our ability to solve complex 
problems, fuels innovation, and makes our workplace more 
enriching and equitable for all.
We are committed to creating an environment 
that supports all employees - irrespective of 
gender, background, disability, or belief. As a 
validation of our efforts, we were honored to be 
named as Great Place to Work® in India for 2024-
25, India’s Best Workplaces™ for Millennials 2024 
and one of the Best Workplaces™ for Women in 
India in the same year.
The Diversity & Inclusion index stands at 8.6, 
reflecting strong employee satisfaction.
Inclusive by design.  
Equitable by nature.
Our Chennai campus, where majority of our 
workforce is located, reflects universal accessibility 
standards. From ramps, elevators with Braille buttons, 
to gender-neutral, accessible washrooms, we ensure 
our infrastructure speaks the language of inclusion.
We have also installed wheelchairs, battery-powered 
vehicles, and implemented emergency protocols that 
include easily movable stretchers, prioritizing dignity 
and care for persons with disabilities.
WINGS drives engagement through
WiNGS drives engagement not just within the 
organization but also extends support through 
outreach programs accessible for employee’s family 
members as well.
WINGS: Women innovating, 
networking, and growing
We launched the LatentView Women Network Group 
(WiNG) on March 7, 2025. This initiative is designed 
to empower women professionals across all levels 
and geographies, providing a platform to connect, 
collaborate, and lead.

Equal opportunity at every level
Our Equal Employment Opportunity & Anti-Discrimination 
Policy, aligned with the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
Act, 2016, upholds our stance on merit-based employment 
and promotion decisions. Accessible on our internal 
HRIS system, this policy ensures that every employee is 
respected, valued, and supported.
Employment decisions at LatentView are based purely 
on merit; without bias toward age, gender, marital 
status, disability, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. 
Our Business Code of Conduct reinforces fairness in 
recruitment, compensation, development, and performance 
appraisals.
We have achieved a 36% women diversity ratio, and 
continue to strive for greater representation across all 
levels. Practicing inclusion is our strength Training for 
managers on Unconscious Bias
Through our Engagement Pulse survey, our employees 
rated high on below areas:
Freedom to express ideas - 8.8
Treat us with equality and empathitic managers – 8.9
As a Org works towards eliminating discrimination – 8.6
Safety, respect, and a 
culture of accountability
Number of complaints reported in FY25: Zero  
To ensure transparency and voice, our whistle-blower 
mechanism empowers employees to report unethical 
conduct confidentially, without fear of retaliation.
Creating a safe, harassment-free environment is 
paramount. We have implemented a robust Prevention 
of Sexual Harassment (POSH) policy supported by 
an active Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) that 
protects employee rights and dignity.

Governance
Ethics at the core. 
Accountability by 
design.
For us, governance is more than a regulatory 
obligation, it is a reflection of who we are 
and how we lead. Our governance framework 
strengthens every aspect of our business. 
It ensures we deliver value responsibly, 
safeguard stakeholder interests, and build 
trust in everything we do, from data security 
and compliance to ethical conduct and 
strategic leadership.
As an analytics-driven organization,  
we believe good governance is a data-
in
formed, principle-driven, future-ready 
discipline, integrated seamlessly  
into our strategy  
and operations.
Integrity, responsibility, and accountability are the pillars of our 
operations. We ensure every decision reflects our unwavering 
commitment to doing the right thing.
1. Ethical business practices
We foster open, honest communication with all stakeholders. 
Our governance culture values clarity, objectivity, and 
consistency in every engagement.
2. Fairness and transparency
Our leadership team defines the strategic direction while 
embodying the principles of responsible governance. The tone 
at the top cascades through the organization, shaping a culture 
of ownership and ethical performance.
3. Leadership with accountability
Governance at LatentView is not a standalone function; it is 
interwoven into our business strategy. This alignment enables 
smarter decision-making, informed resource allocation, and 
sustained long-term growth.
4. Strategic alignment
We maintain a rigorous system of internal controls through 
audits, board evaluations, and a structured accountability 
framework. This ensures every action is deliberate, fair, and 
compliant with both the letter and spirit of the law.
5. Checks, balances, and oversight
As governance norms evolve, we stay ahead of the curve. We 
regularly review and enhance our policies to meet emerging 
regulatory, legal, and ethical standards.
6. Compliance and agility

Compliance
STRONG VALUES.  
STRONGER GOVERNANCE.
Ethical and legal adherence forms the foundation of resilient, responsible business. 
Compliance, for us, is the minimum threshold as we aim higher by institutionalizing integrity, 
accountability, and transparency into every layer of our operations.
Compliance as culture, 
not just control.
We maintain a zero-tolerance policy for 
bribery, corruption, and unethical conduct. 
Our comprehensive Anti-Bribery and Anti-
Corruption Policy sets out strict principles 
for employees, vendors, and partners alike, 
ensuring fairness in every transaction and 
transparency in every engagement. These 
policies serve as the bedrock of trust across 
our stakeholder ecosystem.
Guided by code.  
Driven by ethics.
Our Code of Conduct is not just a rulebook, 
it’s a living framework that empowers 
every leader and team member to act with 
responsibility. It provides clear direction on 
avoiding conflicts of interest and promotes 
the adoption of ethical governance practices 
across the Board, senior management, and 
every level of the organization.
This ethical commitment is embedded in 
our Corporate Governance model, aligning 
decision-making with our sustainability goals 
and reinforcing our leadership’s accountability 
to internal and external stakeholders.
Compliance beyond 
governance.
We go beyond financial or statutory 
compliance to actively adhere to 
environmental, social, and labor-related 
regulations. Whether it is GDPR, ISO 
27001:2013, ISO 27701:2019, HIPAA, or PCI 
DSS, our operations are built to meet, and 
exceed, industry benchmarks for privacy, 
human rights, cybersecurity, diversity, and 
environmental responsibility.
From ensuring gender-neutral hiring to 
meeting the standards of the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities Act, we treat 
compliance as a vehicle to drive inclusivity, 
equity, and long-term impact.
A flawless record of 
regulatory adherence Zero   
Compliance issues 
or violations
Zero   
Penalties or regulatory

Zero

In FY25, we continued our 
impeccable compliance track record.
This unblemished performance 
reflects our deep-rooted compliance 
culture and reinforces our reputation 
as a trusted partner in the global 
analytics space.
