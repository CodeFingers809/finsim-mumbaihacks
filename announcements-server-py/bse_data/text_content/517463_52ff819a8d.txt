Independent Auditor’s Review Report on the Quarterly Unaudited Financial Results of the Company 
Pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015, as amended. 
To, 
The Board of Directors 
Linaks Microelectronics Limited 
12.6 KM, 
Barabanki Road, Chinat, 
Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh - 227105 
We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results of 
LINAKS MICRO ELECTRONICS LIMITED for the period ended on 30/09/2025 attached herewith 
being submitted by the Company Pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations,2015 as amended (the “Listing Regulations”). 
This statement is the responsibility of the Company’s Management and has been approved by the 
Board of Directors has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement 
principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standards 34 (IND AS-34), “Interim Financial 
Reporting” prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2103 as amended read with 
relevant rules issued thereunder and the other accounting principles generally accepted in India. 
Our responsibility is to issue a report on these financial statements based on our review. 
We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent 
Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard 
requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of 
company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus provides less 
assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do not express an 
audit opinion. 
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results prepared in accordance 
with applicable accounting standards and other recognized accounting practices and policies laid 
down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standards 34 (IND AS-34), “Interim Financial Reporting” 
prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2103 as amended read with relevant rules 
issued thereunder and the other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not 
disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing
