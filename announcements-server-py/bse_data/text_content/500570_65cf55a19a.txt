Mumbai,  November 14, 202 5: Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd. (TMPVL) announced its results for  quarter

Performance: 
Consolidated: TMPVL delivered revenues of ₹72.3K Cr (down 13.5%) and EBIT of -₹4.9K Cr (down ₹8.8K Cr). The performance 
was impacted significantly by the cyber incident at JLR. Domestic performance was steady during the quarter but rebounded

disposal of discontinued operations of ₹82.6K Cr. For H1 FY26, the business reported a PBT (bei) of -₹1.5K Cr, a decline of ₹13.9K 
Cr over the previous year.

40 bps YoY), while EBIT margins were at 0.2% (up 10 bps YoY). 
 
Looking Ahead:  
The overall global situation remains challenging. To respond effectively, we will focus on stabilising  production and increasing 
resilience throughout the extended supply chain. In parallel, we will step up our brand -led actions to drive up demand for our 
products and accelerate initiatives aimed at enhancing savings and cash flow. Domestic business continues to witness robust  
demand following the rollout of GST 2.0 . and we will  drive growth through new product interventions and strong marketing 
actions. Overall, we expect an all-round improvement in performance in H2 FY26. 
 
PB Balaji, Group Chief Financial Officer, Tata Motors said:  
“It has been a difficult period for the business. However, we are committed to emerging from the cyber incident even stronger. 
With the demerger completed, both JLR and domestic PV businesses are well poised to leverage the significant opportunities 
provided by this exciting industry. Demand situation remains challenging globally but domestically there are signs of resurgence. 
In this context, our strategy is clear, plans robust and we will continue to execute them with speed and rigour to win”

Electrification / Sustainability 
 
• Development of the first reborn Freelander, initially for sale in China, continues, with brand and show car reveal planned 
for the coming months

• JLR opened a solar farm at its centre in Gaydon, UK, capable of meeting nearly a third of the site’s energy requirements

Financials  
 
JLR’s revenue for the quarter was £4.9b, down 24.3% vs Q2 FY25, while H1 FY26 revenue was £11.5b, down 16.3% YoY. Revenues 
were impacted by the cyber incident and the planned wind down of legacy Jaguar models ahead of the launch of new Jaguar. 
Loss before tax and exceptional items was £(485)m for Q2  FY26 and £(134)m for H1  FY26, down from a profit of £398m and 
£1.1b respectively a year ago. EBIT margin was (8.6)% for the second quarter, down from 5.1% a year ago, and (1.4)% for H1  
FY26, down from 7.1% in H1 FY25. This decrease in profitability is largely due to the cyber incident, the continuing impact of US 
tariffs, reduced volumes as referenced above and  increased VME.  Loss after tax in the quarter was £(5 59)m, compared to a 
profit of £283m in the same quarter a year ago. Exceptional items of £238m in the quarter reflect costs of £196m relating to the 
cyber incident and voluntary redundancy programme costs of £42m. For H1 FY26, the loss after tax was £(311)m compared to 
a profit of £785m in H1 FY25. The decrease in profitability year-on-year was the result of the challenges referred to above.  
Free cash outflow for the quarter was £(791)m and £(1.5)b for H1 FY26, with a closing cash balance of £3.0b. 
   
Looking ahead  
 
 Looking ahead, JLR remains resilient and well placed to address the economic, geopolitical and policy challenges the industry  
faces. Investment spend is expected to remain at £18b over the five -year period from FY24. In light of the challenges faced, 
FY26 guidance has been revised, with EBIT margin in the range of 0% to 2% and free cash outflow of £2.2b to £2.5b. 
 
Adrian Mardell, JLR Chief Executive Officer, said: 
“JLR’s performance in the second quarter of FY26 was impacted by significant challenges, including a cyber incident that stopped 
our vehicle production in September and the impact of US tariffs. JLR has made strong progress in recovering its operations safely 
and at pace following the cyber incident. In our response we prioritised client, retailer and supplier systems and I am pleased to 
confirm that production of all our luxury brands has resumed.  
 
 “The speed of recovery is testament to the resilience and hard work of our colleagues. I am extremely grateful to all our people 
who have shown enormous commitment during this difficult time, and I want to thank our clients, retailers, suppliers and 
everyone in the communities connected with JLR, for their support through this disruption. 
 
 “JLR is a great business with strong global brands, a talented workforce and a loyal customer base. We are now set to deliver 
the outcome of an extraordinary period of British design and engineering, with the arrival of the Range Rover Electric and th e 
new electric Jaguar - cars which will be unrivalled in their performance, design and capability. While we are mindful of the 
economic, geopolitical and policy challenges that our industry faces, we are resilient and well placed to make strong progress. 
 
 “As I approach the end of my 35 -year career at JLR, I am immensely proud of what we have achieved together. Leading JLR as 
CEO over the past three years has been the greatest honour of my career and I am confident that the next chapter will bring 
continued success for this great business under the leadership of PB Balaji.”

Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Limited (formerly Tata Motors Limited) 
The respective Board of Directors and Board of Trustees are also responsible for overseeing the financial 
reporting process of each company and Trust. 
Auditor 's Respons ibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Results 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial results as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report 
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these standalone financial results. 
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial results, whether due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting 
a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may 
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the company's internal control. 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures in the standalone financial results made by the Management and 
Board of Directors. 
Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management's and Board of Directors' use of the going 
concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial 
results or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on 
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions 
may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. 
Evaluate the overall presentation , structure and content of the standalone financial results, including 
the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial results represent the underlying transactions 
and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial results/ interim financial 
statements of the Joint Operation of the Company to express an opinion on the standalone financial 
results .. For the joint operations included in the standalone financial results, which has been audited 
by other auditor, such other auditor remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance 
of the audit carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. Our 
responsibilities in this regard are further described in Other Matters paragraph in this audit report. 
We communicate with those charged with governance of the Company and such other entity included in 
the standalone financial results of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related 
safeguards.

under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, spedflcally Appendix A to Ind AS 10 'Distribution of Non cash assets to Owners', and has created a lfabllity at the fair value of the Demerged Undertaking with 
gain in the income statement (net of assets and Habllities transferred) with the corresponding debit to the Retained Earnings and extinguishing the liability of 111:82,318 crores. There is no impact on net worth 
for this gain booked in the results, accordingly the same is not considered for EPS calculations. 
Fair value has been derived for each of the companies of Demerged Undertaking separately. Depending on the business and data, we have used discounted cash flows, comparable market multiples and available 
quoted price to determine the fair value. 
S) For the quarter ended September 30, 202S, the profit before tax is llt:138 crores and tax charge fs "375 crvres. Upon effective of the Composite Scheme, the tax losses which were available for set-off in the 
quarter ending June 30, 2025, are now moved to the Demerged Undertaking leading to a higher tax charge in the demerged entity. 
6) EKtended Producer Responsibility ("'EPR"} for End of Life of Vehicles for OEMs was notified In January 2025, w.e.f. April 1, 2025. EPR calls for OEMs to buy certificates from Registered Vehicle Scrapping Facility 
("RVSFs") equivalent 8% for the first S years and goes up to 18% by 2039 of steel used 20 years back in case of Passenger Vehides. Central Pollution Control Board ("CPCB"} is in the process of giving darity of 
the EPR policy, including a} Cost of the certificate b) dear methodology for calculating steel content/liability targets for OEMs c) Process for transaction between OEMs and RVSFs and thus the cost of meeting 
the obligations under EPR cannot be reliably estimated as at September 30, 202S. Further, Extended Producer Responsibility ("EPR") for waste batteries management was notified in August 2022 as amended 
from time to time. Said rules call for Producers, as defined under the rules, for environmental sound management of waste batteries. Company shall be able to meet the obligations under the said rules either

7) The Statutory Auditors have carried an audit of the above re sults for the quarter and Six months ended September 30, 202S and have issued an unmodified opinion on the same.

Passenger Vehicles Limited (formerly 'Tata Motors Limited') for the quarter ended 30 
September 2025 and year to date results for the period from 1 April 2025 to 30 
September 2025 pursuant to Regulation 33 and Regulation 52(4) read with Regulation 
63 of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requiremen ts) Regulations, 2015, as amended 
To the Board of Directors of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Limited (formerly 'Tata 
Motors Limited') 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of unaudited consolidated financial results of Tata 
Motors Passenger Vehicles Limited (formerly 'Tata Motors Limited') (hereinafter referred to as "the 
Parent"), and its subsidiaries (the Parent and its subsidiaries together referred to as "the Group"), its 
joint operation and its Trust and its share of the net profit after tax and total comprehensive income 
of its associates and joint ventures for the quarter ended 30 September 2025 and year to date results

Regulations, 2015, as amended ("Listing Regulations"). 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Parent's management and approved by the Parent's 
Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement 
principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" ("Ind AS 34"), 
prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 and Regulation 52(4) read with Regulation 
63 of the Listing Regulations. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based

3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements 
(SRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the 
Entity ", issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial 
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting 
matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope 
than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable 
us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified 
in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
We also performed procedures in accordance with the circular issued by the Securities and Exchange 
Board of India under Regulation 33(8) of the Listing Regulations, to the extent applicable . 
4. The Statement includes the results of the entities mentioned in Annexure I to the Statement. 
5. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above and based 
on the consideration of the review reports of the other auditors referred to in paragraphs 7 and 9 
below, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, 
prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid 
Indian Accounting Standard and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and as stated 
in paragraph 6 below in the context of the overriding effect of the provisions in the Composite Scheme 
of Arrangement as approved by the National Company Law Tribunal ('NCL T'), regarding accounting 
of demerger of commercial vehicles business from the specified retrospective appointed date, has 
not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52(4) 
read with Regulation 63 of the Listing Regulations , including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, 
or that it contains any material misstatement.

Registrar of Companies "ROC", the Scheme became effective from October 1, 2025. 
Pursuant to the approval and effectiveness of the Scheme: 
a. Demerged Company has transferred all the assets, liabilities and reserves (including other components of equity and general reserve) valuing "11,281 crores at their respective 
carrying amounts, pertaining to the Demerged Undertaking as appearing in the books of accounts of the Demerged Company, being transferred on account of demerger. 
Accordingly, the De merged Company has reduced from its books of account, the carrying amounts appearing on the appointed date.

Motors Finance Limited with Tata Capital Limited w.e.f. May 8,2025 with appointed date April 1, 2024.

particularly within the United States, resulting in reversal of unused provision by "1,779 crores (£ 149 million) in other expenses. 
6) On August 30, 2025, there was an Information security incident that impacted some of the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) IT assets. All known impacts on its results for the quarter and six 
months ended September 30, 2025, on account of this incident have been considered. Decisive actions taken to restart business safely, support stakeholders and recover operations
