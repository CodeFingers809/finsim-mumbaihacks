The Board of Directors 
Inter Globe Finance Limited  
 
LIMITED REVIEW REPORT FOR THE QUARTER & HALF YEAR ENDED 30TH SEPTEMBER ,2025 
 
We have reviewed the accompanying statement of Standalone Unaudited Financial Results of Inter Globe 
Finance Limited (“the Company’) for the quarter  & half year ended 30TH SEPTEMBER, 2025, being 
submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended. 
 
This statement is the responsibility of the Company’s Management and has been approve d by the Board of 
Directors/ Committee of  Board of Directors  has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” (“Ind 
AS 34”), prescribed under Section 133 of The Companies Act, 2013 read with relevant rules issued thereunder 
and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on 
these financial statements based on our review. 
 
We conducted our review in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagement (SRE) 2410, engagements 
to Review Financial Statements issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of financial 
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of the Company’s personnel responsible for financial and 
accounting matters and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in 
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of 
The Companies Act, 2013 and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become 
aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. 
Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
 
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that 
the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standard a nd other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of 
regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing obligations and disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended, 
including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement
