Shalin Sheth: Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for being present on this call. I, Shalin Sheth, MD and 
Founder of Advait Energy Transitions Limited, welcome you all for the earnings conference call 
of Advait Energy Transitions Limited to discuss the company's business and financial 
performance during the quarter and the half year ended. 
 The company expresses sincere gratitude to its investors and shareholders for their trust. It is 
highlighted by a 51% increase in total shareholders up to 32,500 as of 30th September, 2025. 
The first half of the financial year 2026 has been strong with Advait Energy's order book, which 
surpasses Rs.1,000 crores. This is signifying robust execution capability and sustained growth. 
 The order book has grown by 177% YoY with 76% attributed to PTS business, which is Power 
Transmission System and 24% is to the NRE business that is New and Renewable Division. This 
milestone underscores the company's confidence in continuing to add their orders in coming 
months, maintaining its upward growth trajectory. 
 During half year 2026, the company reported consolidated revenue of INR275 crores, which is 
a significant growth of 160% year-on-year basis. EBITDA during the same period was INR31.06 
crores with a growth of 87% year-on-year basis. EBITDA margins were 11.3% and net worth 
has grown by 43% year-on-year basis and stood at INR263 crores. 
 Below are the key developments that took place during the quarter, like  
- Successfully secured the ERS order for 765 KV, 400 KV segment from Power Grid 
amounting about INR90 crores that is one of the biggest in this segment in India. 
- Successfully secured a single largest EPC order for company amounting 100 crores plus 
for the DGVCL for the replacement of MVCC conductor and allied electrical existing 
transmission lines.  
- Successfully executed challenging 250 kilometers of stringing of OPW cables on live line 
that is for 220 KV charge situation at Power Grid at a very difficult region of Leh and 
Ladakh. This was done in record time having the execution of 12,500 feet above the sea 
level height and -15 degree of temperature.

- Successfully executed the first EPC project for installing high-tension low-sag conductor, 
which is our new segment for 66 KV line in GETCO and we have completed more than 50 
km in a record time.  
- Successfully completed 350 of winch machines for the power transmission line. This is also 
supplied in a record time. 
 During the time, we also did record supplies of the stringing tools to the various customers in 
India and also abroad. Our company also secured its first order for providing the tower erection 
crane that is an automatic crane. 
 The company has achieved a strong project execution in this quarter completing several projects 
ahead of the schedule and steadily increasing market share in the stringing tools, ERS business, 
OPGW business, etc. This is supported by ongoing government investments and reforms in the 
power transmission and distribution sector. 
 The business opportunities are expanding for both established players and the newest entrants. 
This favorable environment combined with the company's operational efficiency and strategic 
focus positions it well to deliver the improved financial performance going forward. The 
company remains committed for leveraging market dynamics and government support to drive 
the growth and sustain its competitive position. 
 Key updates on the business performance for PTS divisions are below: 
- One is the manufacturing of ACS and OPGW cables. In this division, the company has 
achieved its approval with the key Indian utilities and company has also secured its first 
Level-N projects in Malaysia. We are also looking forward for further Level-N projects and 
overseas supplies of ACS in the coming part of the year. 
- In PTS power transmission stringing tools, the company has done record sales and our order 
book is excellently strong. We have supplied our tools in more than five countries in the 
first half of the year. 
- In ERS, we have received a record order booking and we are repeatedly looking forward 
for orders for the second part of the year. The company is also putting the new ERS 
manufacturing facility, which is going to be ready by next month. 
- Company is putting a grand integrated manufacturing facility, which is acquired at 35 km 
from Ahmedabad in a place called Gangad. All the new manufacturing and expansion of 
existing manufacturing units will be ready by July 2026 as per the plan and we are pleased 
to inform that the company has already tied up the capex requirement for the same. 
Company is looking forward for the strong EPC presence in the products they are operating 
into and we have also started getting the sustained revenue for our carbon credit business. 
- The NRE division, which is a critical part of the country's roadmap towards achieving the 
Viksit Bharat 2047 goals and also towards achieving the 45% non-fossil energy generation 
in India, company is committed to provide its action plan for the same. This emphasizes 
sustainable development and clean energy transition. The company has introduced 
attractive product link schemes and encouraging participation in this sector.

 Leveraging our expertise, the company initiated its renewable journey in 2023-2024 by planning 
of construction of 300 megawatt electrolyzer manufacturing plant, which is coming along with 
its BESS system project in Gujarat. Company also completed India's first green hydrogen EPC 
project and we will be delivering one more project of 1 megawatt in Bharuch in this quarter. 
These initiatives position our company to capitalize the significant growth opportunities in 
evolving renewable energy landscape. 
 To summarize, Advait Group has demonstrated strong growth, reflecting its success and 
diversified capabilities across the power transmission and energy transition sector. Advait 
continues to focus on developing new product solutions under the power transmission solutions 
and actively working towards building a robust product portfolio for coming year. 
 In the Energy Transition space, Advait is committed to becoming a key player across the entire 
new NRE ecosystem. Company has developed a partnership with world-class technology 
providers to develop indigenous electrolyzers and fuel cells in the coming time.

That concludes with an update on financial highlights of the company. I shall now request the 
moderator to open the floor for question-and-answer session. 
Moderator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from 
the line of Raj Shah with RK Family Office. Please go ahead. 
Raj Shah: Sir, can you provide me the break-up of our INR813 crores order book in PTS division? Like 
how much is from RDSS, how much is from OPGW, how much is from stringing tools, etc. 
Shalin Sheth: Narayan bhai, can you please take up the question? 
Narayan Singh: Just a second. Thank you, sir. And for PTS and OPGW, we have Rs.3.54 crores order. In ERS 
division, we have INR22.45 crores. And for tools division, we have INR5.97 crores. And PTS, 
EPC and others INR777.86 crores. For GH2 EPC, INR3.14 crores. And solar EPC, INR119.90 
crores and New Energy business of BESS, INR137.38 crores. 
Raj Shah: I missed your RDSS number. What is RDSS order book? 
Parth Gandhi: Hello, this is Parth here. RDSS figure is INR270 crores. 
Raj Shah: INR270 crores, okay. Sir my second question is when I add up the revenue of our products in 
PTS division from presentation, it adds up to INR70 crores to INR73 crores. And we have 
reported INR97 crores. S, from which product does balance INR25 crores is coming? 
Narayan Singh: Yes, sir. You are talking about revenue, right? 
Parth Gandhi: I'll brief you entirely. Your first question was the break-up for the order booking, right? As I 
mentioned previously, the RDSS order booking is around INR270 crores. Now, your next 
question is about the revenue, right? 
Raj Shah: Yes. 
Parth Gandhi: So, revenue break-up, if I talk about the rest is from the HTLS EPC and Stringing Tool division. 
Raj Shah: Okay. My third question is, last year, three-fourth of our revenue came in H2. So, what are we 
expecting? Are we expecting the same this year? Like three-fourth of our revenue came in H2 
last year. So, what are we expecting this year? 
Shalin Sheth: Actually, this is very difficult to answer about the numbers. But we believe that we will maintain 
our growth in a growth trajectory, that overall growth rate about 50%, 60% that we did. So, these 
are the numbers we are looking forward. 
Raj Shah: Okay. Sir, when are we planning to have revenue from BESS division? As we have received 
BOO order of INR130 plus crores earlier this year. So, when will revenue start? 
Shalin Sheth: We expect the battery energy, the first INR50 crores to INR60 crores of supplies to be done in 
the month of March and the entire order to be completed by June. That is Q4 2025-2026 may be 
INR 50 crores and balance INR 60 crores or something will be Q1 of 2026-2027.

Raj Shah: Okay. Thank you. 
Moderator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Shivam Singh, an Individual Investor. Please 
go ahead. 
Shivam Singh: Yes. So, I want to ask about the cash flow and trade receivables. It is increasing very 
significantly. Do we need to raise equity, or how are we planning to deal with it? 
Shalin Sheth: For our existing operations, we are not foreseeing any requirement of equity raising. And it will 
be able to sustain on its own. And since the business is it is growing by more than 100%, 
definitely we need to use our bank limit. And we are able to get the bank limit as and when 
required. So, we are not looking forward for any equity for our existing business. 
Shivam Singh: Sir, our return on equity is much lower than what we are using up. And our profit does not sustain 
the cash flow requirements that we need. The trade receivables have increased by INR60 crores 
in H1. But our profit is less than INR27 crores. So, there’s a INR33 crores difference that we 
need to fund. 
Shalin Sheth: Actually, what is happening, these are the things, which are changing month-on-month. So, 
when the quarters are changing, so it’s the circulatory nature of the business. So, these funds you 
will see in the coming months will be there in the books. So, it’s just circulatory in nature. 
Otherwise, I should look at how the business is being run. And we do not find any difficulty in 
any case. In fact, since last three to four quarters, our company is able to even expand our existing 
projects from our internal cash flow. 
Shivam Singh: But sir, our incremental revenue has lower profit margins. So, as we scale, that will be a problem. 
Shalin Sheth: Sir, we are not looking for only the percentage of margin. We are looking forward the quantum 
of the margin that is going to increase our net worth of the company. At the same time, it should 
be able to sustain the operations. And as I told you, from our internal cash flow, we are also able 
to fund up our new expansion from internal cash flow. 
 So, we do not find any problem. And if you want any specific details, I will be very happy. You 
can just ask the questions. Provide your email. We can provide the complete working to you in 
time. 
Shivam Singh: Okay. Sure sir. And sir, regarding the AGPL profit margins, sir when do we see an increase in 
it? 
Shalin Sheth: See, I would like to address this question to the benefit of all the respected shareholders or the 
interesting party at this call. I will say that when you are building the organization, when you 
are building the business, when you are building the enterprise, you always should look at how 
we can increase our capability, capacity, and qualification. 
 So, AGPL, we are at the phase of doing all the three things. And we are proudly saying that for 
AGPL, last quarter, we are now qualified for bidding very big EPC orders for the solar. By next 
Advait Energy Transitions Limited  
November 14, 2025 
 
Page 7 of 12 
 
month, we will be only among the few companies, maybe two or three companies in India who 
have completed two projects in the green hydrogen. So, that is one more thing. 
 We have received the very strong support of the banks. So, we have been also getting the 
capacity. And we have built up a very strong team. So, you know that for making any business, 
it takes some time to come to the levels to give the margins. And we are very confident that it 
will match our group margins in the year to come. 
 
Shivam Singh: Any patents or any intellectual properties that we have, because further competition will enter, 
do we have any defense against it? 
Shalin Sheth: Good question. See, what I will say that we have done a technology transfer agreement. And 
under the agreement that the same technology cannot be given in a particular segment in a 
particular country, that’s what we have done. 
 Similarly, for fuel cell, we have entered an agreement that for our Asia-Pacific region, we will 
be only holding those technologies and which is patented. So, these two things are patented by 
our partners, but this region belongs to us. So, that's why we have secured the future of the 
company. 
 There is one more product which we have developed recently. And Advait is going to have their 
own patent. We cannot disclose the name of the patent now -- name of the product now. But we 
will be able to inform to you in the next one or two quarters that those products are patented in 
the name of Advait. 
 And for BESS, let me tell you, we are not a research company. So, we are looking forward for 
our actions into manufacturing and some project space for the BESS. And I think that does not 
require the patent for now. But we will be able to give you some good news in the time to come 
about the BESS also. 
Shivam Singh: Okay, sir. And sir, is there any future plans of derisking from PSUs, because major elections of 
UP and other states are coming up? So, government funding is going to dry up. Do we have any 
plans? 
Shalin Sheth: See, your company at the moment is not working in a business of INR3,000 crores, INR4,000 
crores. And all the products that we are operating are very essential in nature. Like optical fiber, 
like ERS, like special conductors that increase the conductivity, like this BESS that has to be 
done in time. So, these are the specialized funded projects. And we do not foresee any problem, 
because those are the priority sector of the government. 
Shivam Singh: Okay, sir. And sir, do we have any capex in the near future after the one we are finishing right 
now? 
Shalin Sheth: Sir, regarding the capex, I would request Mr. Priyank Shah sitting with me to answer the 
question. 
Advait Energy Transitions Limited  
November 14, 2025 
 
Page 8 of 12 
 
Priyank Shah: So, as of now, whatever the capex has been tied up for current financial year, apart of that, in 
AETL we are not going to incur any phase capex in coming financial year. 
Shivam Singh: Okay, sir. Thank you so much, sir. I will get back into the queue. 
Moderator: Thank you. Next question comes to the line of Raj Shah with RK Family Office. Please go ahead. 
Raj Shah: Sir, earlier when I asked about revenue mismatch, you told me that it is from stringing tools and 
RDSS. So, they are already in the slide. So, what I was asking is if you see slide number 19 -- 
slide number 20 of your presentation and if I add up the revenue of the PTS division, it comes 
to INR70 crores to INR73 crores. And you have reported INR97 crores. So, from where this 
balance, INR25 crores is coming that I was asking. 
Management: Thank you for your question. Just give me few seconds, and we are getting back to you with the 
exact breakup of revenue. Just give me few seconds. Yes? Thank you. 
Raj Shah: Yes, okay. 
Shalin Sheth: Meanwhile, we can go for the next question? 
Raj Shah: Yes. So, sir, you told in your commentary that opportunities are coming out of India, like you 
won an order in Malaysia also. So, sir, how big they can be? And in coming years, are you 
targeting that this much percent revenue will come from outside India? 
Parth Gandhi: Regarding fresh orders, this is regarding the live-line installation of the OPGW. Wherein we are 
going to do the installation of more than 800-900 kilometers in the Malaysia and the order value, 
if I convert it into the Indian rupees, the order will be around INR12 crores to INR15 crores. 
Raj Shah: So, sir, I was asking that is this one-time or are we targeting many other projects outside India? 
And if we are targeting other projects outside India, then how big they can be? 
Shalin Sheth: Yes, of course. So, Malaysia is a stepping stone. Apart from Malaysia, we have already been 
bidded. We have given our expression of interest in Ethiopia, which is around 500 kilometers. 
We have given our quotation and interest in Kazakhstan. So, we are doing The OPGW LiveLine 
business outside India. Apart from that, we already have footings in the overseas market through 
our supplies of stringing tools. 
Raj Shah: Sir facility which is coming in July 2026, is it of electrolyzer or of existing products? Then how 
much capacity will get increased? 
Shalin Sheth: See, I would like to elaborate the answer of the question. As I told that we are coming up with 
an integrated manufacturing facility. In this, our both the division, PTS and NRE will be having 
their own manufacturing under new manufacturing. 
 So, PTS is going to be expanded existing operations of the ERS by putting the new ERS 
manufacturing plant, which will be supplying about 350 towers per year. That will be the 
capacity. Stringing tools, our capacity will be increased from current INR30 crores to INR40 
crores to INR80 crores to INR100 crores per year. 
Advait Energy Transitions Limited  
November 14, 2025 
 
Page 9 of 12 
 
 And then for our NRE business, we are first putting 10 megawatt of capacity for building up of 
the electrolyzers. That will be ready by the month of January. And we are looking forward for 
putting 300 megawatt of manufacturing capacity under this segment. That will be ready by the 
end of 2026. 
Raj Shah: Okay. Okay. Thank you, sir, if you have answer to my first question about revenue mismatch? 
Vatsal Kundalia: Yes, sure, Vatsal Desai, I am just giving you a quick breakup of the revenue that we have 
reported. INR5.16 crores is from ACS OPW business. INR0.95 crores is the revenue from 
Stringing Tools business. INR2.26 crores is the revenue from ERS business. INR6.32 crores is 
from the reconducting of HTLS project business. 
 INR23.91 crores is from Power DISCOM projects. INR16.13 crores is from the OPGW 
LiveLine projects business. And the rest INR20 crores is from Power Transmission EPC 
Business, which is executed for our Private customers. This is basically conductor and cable 
stringing job for their ongoing projects business. 
Raj Shah: Okay. Okay. Thank you. 
Moderator: Thank you. A reminder to all the participants that you may press star and one to ask a question. 
Next question comes to the line of Basant Bansal with NBG Investments. Please go ahead. 
Basant Bansal: Yes. Good afternoon. There is a new item on Moneycontrol today, which says that central to 
temporarily slow down renewable energy tenders as generation outpaces absorption capacity. 
So, what is your view on that? I mean, have you experienced any kind of slowdown on the 
ground, or how do you see it? 
Shalin Sheth: So, I think you would have heard this is about the slowdown of some of the solar sector. Am I 
right? 
Basant Bansal: They are talking about renewable energy tenders. 
Shalin Sheth: I know, but that too in renewable, you might be talking about the solar. Am I right? So, I would 
request you to please go through the article once again. If it is solar, then we can reply to you. 
Because as per our knowledge, the solar sector for the time may or should go down. I can explain 
the reason to you. 
Basant Bansal: Please. They have not mentioned whether it is solar or other things. 
Shalin Sheth: Okay. See, basically, buy and large, as we talk about the new energy sector, people thinks about 
solar sector. This is because of the very strong and fast capacity buildup into the solar installment 
in India in last two years, in last three years. Now, additional buildup is creating the issues with 
the system stability, system harmonics, and providing the power requirement onto non-solar 
hours. 
 So, the immediate need has come to stabilize the system by augmenting with the other transient 
energy solutions so that you might be seeing that many states are maintaining their obligation 
for the storage, EOS, energy obligation for the storage. So, under EOS scheme, a lot of BESS 
Advait Energy Transitions Limited  
November 14, 2025 
 
Page 10 of 12 
 
projects are coming. So, as soon as the BESS projects will pick up and to be installed, again the 
solar will go on. So it’s a temporary slowdown as to match up the system harmonics. 
Basant Bansal: So will it impact our operations for the current year or maybe for the sometime during next year? 
Shalin Sheth: Sir, we are at the moment doing a miniscule part of the total sector. We will continue to grow 
with that segment as per our existing growth plan and numbers. 
Basant Bansal: Okay. Okay. Thank you. This is helpful. 
Moderator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Shivam Singh, an individual investor. Please 
go ahead. 
Shivam Singh: Sir, so the order book that we have, what is the margin that we are working on in those ones?  
Shalin Sheth: See, to be precise, we have got order book from the PTS and NRE, both the divisions separately. 
PTS is a business we have demonstrated our ability by creating the qualifications, and again, we 
strategize. So, we hope to continue with the same margin year-on-year basis, which is basically 
EBITDA between 14% to 16% and that we’ve been doing. So, and for the NRE, we hope to 
improve the margin. 
Shivam Singh: Do we have a blended margin range we are looking to achieve? 
Shalin Sheth: I think it will be some kind of indicative answer from my side. So, from management 
perspective, I should not be able to answer these things. 
Shivam Singh: Okay, sir. Thank you. 
Moderator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Gautham Asmekar, an individual investor. 
Please go ahead. 
Gautham Asmekar: Yes. I just wanted to ask about the PLI scheme. Are we on the track or the timeline laid out by 
the government for installing the electrolyzers and getting the benefit of the PLI? And second 
thing, when do we see the benefits of the PLI visible in our balance sheet? 
Shalin Sheth: Thank you for the question. The PLI scheme, which is going to affect the production and supplies 
done from the year 2027 to 2031, it may be possible that with the requirement of the industry, it 
may be extended for a year to the benefit of all PLI holders with respect to the sector. 
Gautham Asmekar: Okay. 
Shalin Sheth: For your kind information, I was a part of the CEO forum, which was called by the Honorable 
Ministry of Renewables. And we had discussed this point very significantly and we are hoping 
for a very strong momentum in this segment time ahead. 
Gautham Asmekar: Okay. But as a company, we are on track regarding the timelines set by the government. 
Advait Energy Transitions Limited

Page 11 of 12 
 
Shalin Sheth: As a company, we are perfectly on time so that we do not miss the opportunity. At the same 
time, we do not load existing operations. 
Gautham Asmekar: Okay, And partly my question related to the solar EPC was answered by you in the previous 
session. But as you said, you need a BESS also as a supportive thing for the solar energy to get 
the demand picked up. So, how are we capitalizing on the BESS part? Because it seems that we 
need a lot of heavy BESS projects so as to complement the solar energy. So are we -- I mean, 
how are we capitalizing on BESS? 
Shalin Sheth: I think as we have taken our first project of 100-megawatt hour to be completed by June. We are 
bidding some more projects, but we are very capital sensitive, and we are very margin-sensitive 
company. So we'll see about the margins of the project. At the same time, your company is 
planning to put up their upcoming manufacturing facility for the BESS DC block supplying, and 
we hope to be ready by year '26. So this is the way we are going to capitalize this requirement 
and momentum. 
Gautham Asmekar: Okay. Thank you. 
Moderator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Basant Bansal with NPG Investments. Please 
go ahead. 
Basant Bansal: Yes. Sir, on the balance sheet side, I have two questions. One is the other current assets which 
has increased from INR32 crores to INR57 crores. So, what is this increase for and what are the 
main items included in it? 
Shalin Sheth: In current asset, mainly increase due to reclassification of our withheld money which are due in 
next 12 months. 
Basant Bansal: So, that is from your debtors? 
Shalin Sheth: Yes, yes. This is the withheld money which is receivable after completion of the project which 
can be due in next 12 months. 
Basant Bansal: Okay, okay. And if you don't mind, what would be the quantum of that? 
Shalin Sheth: It is approximately 46 crores. 
Basant Bansal: Okay. And my next question is on the investment side. So, this has increased from INR12 crores 
to INR54 crores. So, again if you can help me understand what is this increase for and which 
type of investments you have made? 
Priyank Shah: So, we have invested in our subsidiary company called Advait Green Energy. Our commitment 
there is to set up 300 megawatt of electrolyzer factory. Also to tying up the technology partner 
for getting the licenses for electrolyzer and fuel cell. So we have invested this money for building 
up AGPL as per our plan. And this is our investment into new and renewable energy segment. 
And we are -- time ahead, we are looking forward for making this operational and making it 
successful.
