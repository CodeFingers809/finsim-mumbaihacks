Dear Madam / Sir, 
 
We refer to our earlier intimation dated 6th March, 2025, wherein the Company had informed 
about the successful implementation and acquisition of KSK Mahanadi Power Company Limited

significant indirect ownership in Raigarh Champa Rail Infrastructure Private Limited (RCRIPL), 
which is under the corporate insolvency resolution process of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy

KMPCL, which owns 1,800 MW operational and another 1,800 MW under construction thermal 
power plant located in the state of Chhattisgarh. 
 
We wish to inform that the resolution plan submitted by the Company for RCRIPL under the 
corporate insolvency resolution process has been approved by the Committee of Creditors and 
the Company has received a Letter of Intent from the Resolution Professional on 19th 
November, 2025. The closure of the transaction shall be subject to the receipt of approval from 
the National Company Law Tribunal. 
 
Yours faithfully, 
 
For JSW Energy Limited
