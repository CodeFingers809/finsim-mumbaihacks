Management Views
“Our consolidated revenues for Q2FY26 grew 20% QoQ, with the Specialty Cables business recording 
19% QoQ growth, supported by stable demand trends and consistent execution across key end-
markets.
In our Train Control and Signaling segment, we achieved a significant milestone in the approval process 
for the KAVACH System (Version 4.0). We received the Interim Independent Safety Assessment (ISA) 
Report, which affirms our adherence to quality and safety management in line with CENELEC 
standards. This interim report bolsters our confidence in securing the final approval as a listed vendor 
from the Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO) of the Kavach 4.0 System in the near 
term. This development strengthens our positioning to participate meaningfully in India’s railway 
modernization and safety enhancement programs.
Our order book remains firm, reflecting sustained market demand and continued confidence in our 
capabilities and solutions.
Looking ahead, we remain focused on deepening our presence in our core cables domain, while 
strategically evaluating opportunities to foray into other high-growth sectors where our technical 
capabilities and manufacturing excellence can deliver differentiated value. With BIS approval secured 
for our Solar cable portfolio, we are now positioned to participate in the Solar segment, while continuing 
to build out our EV cable offerings.”

Superior Properties
Improved resistance to tensile shear and compressive force; abrasion, thermal, flame-propagation, deformation, and cut 
through-resistance; significant weight reduction; enhanced fire safety
Well Synchronized
E-beam process ensures equal dose distribution, high speed, and with online data logging, it is fully synchronized. This 
process doesn’t require any additives, nor does it generate any hazardous chemical by-products unlike traditional chemical 
crosslinking
Energy Efficient
E-beam cross-linking does not require the hours of cure time needed for other conventional chemical cross-linking methods 
resulting in an energy efficient process and higher throughput
Enhanced Cross Linking
Electron Beam (E-beam) processing technique provides enhanced cross linking and polymer modification to cables to achieve 
much superior mechanical and thermal properties. 
Rising adoption of Electron Beam Cables across high -growth applications – EVs, fuel cell vehicles, renewable 
energy, aerospace, and high -rise infrastructure – driven by superior performance and reliability
