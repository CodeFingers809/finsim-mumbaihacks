I would now like to hand over the floor to Mr. Prat ik Jagtap from EY investor team. Thank you and 
over to you, sir. 
 
Pratik Jagtap 
 
Thank you, Pelsia. Good morning to everyone who have joined the earnings call for the quarter ended 
September 30, 2025. Now I would like to introduce the members of the management who are present 
for the call. Ms. Nisha Dutt, Managing Director and  CEO; Mr. Sumit Kumar, CFO; Mr. Harsha Angeri, 
Head Corporate Strategy and AI and Ramu Akkili, Company Secretary and Compliance Officer. 
 
I would like to start the conference call by going through the Safe Harbor clause. Such statements in 
this presentation concerning our future growth pros pects are forward-looking statements, which 
involve several risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from thos e 
in such forward-looking statements. These risks and  uncertainties relating to these statements 
include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in earnings, our ability to successfully integrate acquisition, 
competition in our areas of business, client concen tration, liability for damages in our contracts, 
withdrawal of tax incentives, political instability , unauthorized use of our intellectual property and  
general economic conditions affecting our industry. 
 
So with this, I now hand over the call to Ms. Nisha Dutt to take it forward. Over to you, Nisha. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Thank you, Pratik. Good morning, everyone, and welc ome to our investor call. Thank you for joining 
us today as we share updates for Q2. Before I get i nto the Q2 update, I'd like to begin by addressing 
the board level changes that took place following o ur last AGM. Our chairman, who was retiring by 
rotation, did not receive the requisite majority and consequently ceased to be a director. 
 
Following this, two other independent directors hav e also stepped down. We thank them for their 
valuable contributions and support during their ten ure. My immediate focus right now is on 
reconstituting the Board. We intend to complete thi s process ahead of our Q3 results. More than 
simply filling out the position, my goal is to brin g in leaders with right expertise, individuals that  are 
aligned with our vision and capable of driving innovation and long-term value. 
 
So, this may take a little bit of time, but we'll g et there. I also want to assure you that our busine ss 
fundamentals remain strong, and our strategic priorities are firmly on track. We are also in midst of a 
broader reset at multiple levels. So, we are doing a reset across the brand, at the board level and at  
the management team level as well. We have recently on-boarded a new sales set, and I'm also in the 
process of bringing in some legal and HR leadership. 
 
So, this is a part of a larger reset, and I would s ay that most of the cleanup that I've been speaking  
about in our investor calls is behind us. But that said, a few legacy areas still require a deeper review. 
3 
Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
So, some of these may call for some financial or structural corrections in the coming quarters to ensure 
that we right-size the business and set a strong foundation for sustainable growth. 
 
Now, coming to the Q2 results, I'm happy to share that for the first time since June 20, 2022, we have 
achieved operational profitability. We are PAT positive without any exceptional items. So, I would say 
that in the truest sense, we have returned to profi tability this quarter driven by operations and not 
one-time gain. And this is a key milestone in our j ourney, which strengthens our ability to reinvest i n 
growth. This is something that we have been driving  towards as you are aware from the beginning. 
I've been saying that we are trying to fix the fundamentals of the business, and I'm trying to put Subex 
back on a sustained trajectory. So for me, this is a big milestone actually. 
 
And our top line this quarter grew by approximately  4% over the previous quarter. EBITDA has been 
positive six out of the eight quarters. So, I would say that -- sorry, seven of the eight quarters, reflecting 
consistent and disciplined performance. Overall, our business remains strong. We are supported by a 
robust order book. 
 
In the last few months, we have announced deals wor th $15 million that we announced to stock 
exchanges and I think most of you got it. So, we ha ve renewed long-standing partnerships with our 
leading operators in APAC, Europe, and over for fiv e and six years respectively. And we have also 
secured new engagement with a leading telco in Netherlands to deliver a unified platform for MVNO 
billing and wholesale partner settlement. 
 
We also won a major deal with leading APAC operator  to upgrade and enhance their revenue 
assurance and fraud management capabilities through Subex's HyperSense platform, including AI use 
cases. So, this should strengthen our revenue prote ction, improve fraud detection and unlock 
recurring value. 
 
Another significant win came from Middle-East, wher e we'll upgrade an existing fraud management 
system to HyperSense. Again, we'll leverage AI to enhance operators' fraud management capabilities. 
So this, all in all, if you think about it, we have  actually had good wins this quarter from, I would say, 
across the geographies. We had wins from Middle-Eas t, Europe, Africa. So, it's been APAC. It's been 
quite nicely spread out for us, and that tells us that we are doing something right here. 
 
We have been building our order book quite strongly . And from a thought leadership perspective as 
well, Subex has been recognized for the second cons ecutive year in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for AI 
in CSP operations. So, this is an acknowledgment of  our position as a trusted innovation partner to 
telco leaders worldwide. I think this is also notable specifically because we are one of the few product 
companies from India in this quadrant, and that rea lly makes us proud because most of the other 
companies that you would find in the quadrant are more service companies. 
 
So, we have some unique distinction here of being a  product company. While we have maintained 
profitability, achieving consistent top line growth  remains a challenge, and I'm aware of that. So, my  
focus going forward is to make sure that we deepen relationships within our existing accounts through 
new product offerings to expand our customer base i n premarket. And this should  help us get back 
on the top line growth curve, which we really definitely want to get back on. So as a part of this reset, 
like I said, we have strengthened our management team. 
 
I've appointed a new head of sales. He's based in Europe. He brings extensive international experience, 
strong sales leadership, deep domain expertise in t elco and technology. So, I'm hoping that he will 
really help us play a key role in driving the next phase of growth. And as several of you have requested 
4 
Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
in past, we are planning to conduct an investor day in the next few weeks. So, please keep an eye out 
for the announcement around it. 
 
And next, I'll just cover consolidated financial re sults for Q2. All numbers are in INR. Revenue for t he 
quarter stood at INR 68.9 crores against INR 66.4 crores for the previous quarter. Normalized EBITDA 
for the quarter is at INR 7.3 crores against INR 4.3 crores for the previous quarter. 
 
Normalized PAT for the quarter is at INR 3.9 crores  against INR 12.8 crores for the previous quarter. 
PAT for the quarter is at INR 2.8 crores as against  INR 13 crores that included an exceptional item in  
the previous quarter. 
 
So thank you for listening. And as always, I'll bra ce for the real action now, your questions and 
comments. So, I'll hand it back to you.

Thank you, ma'am. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. If you 
have a question, please press * and 1 on your telep hone keypad, and wait for your turn to ask the 
question. If you would like to withdraw your request, you may do so by pressing * and 1 again. Ladies 
and gentlemen, if you have any question, please press * and 1 on your telephone keypad. 
 
The first question comes from Sanjyot Khare, an individual investor. Please go ahead. 
 
Sanjyot Khare 
 
Hi. Good morning, Nisha and team. First of all, congratulations on positive PAT quarter. Really, we are 
seeing this after a long time, and great work there . So, my question is about the business outlook. I 
mean, it's good to see that three orders, big order s have won in this quarter. And how the business 
demand look like? Are we seeing a pickup in deal co nversions? Are there any large transformation 
programs or customer wins in pipeline that could marginally impact FY26 revenue? 
 
And another question is about any collaborations in  AI ecosystem that could expand Subex 
addressable market. Are you looking, planning or already in some of these collaborations which should 
be helping Subex increase the market? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Hi. So, on your question in terms of deal conversion, w e are definitely seeing much faster flips than I 
saw last year, and I would say a few previous quarters. So definitely, this has been a good quarter for 
us. In terms of deal conversion, what we are seeing  truly is that there are geographies that have 
become a little bit more agile, and I would say faster for us. But there are still one or two geographies 
which are slow. And what that means by that, I mean that I might have order win that I am sitting on, 
but I don't have a PO from them even after few quarters have passed. 
 
So, there are some geographies that are really slow. So, I'm hoping that they also pick up and then we 
are able to come back and announce a few more deals . But overall, if I think about it, I think it has 
been -- I'm seeing some better conversions this yea r, definitely. But, yeah, one of the geographies 
continue to cover less. 
 
In terms of your question on AI, I think we don't h ave a specific collaboration. What we do is we 
typically work with our customers on POCs, and we c ollaborate directly with them. We do have data 
5 
Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
partners, but we don't have specific collabs in that sense. We are working across LLMs and AI, and we 
do both cloud-based and on-prem. And we work on specific use cases with the customers, which I've 
spoken about earlier also. So, we have two customer s in North America. We have one in, actually 
Middle-East that we are working with. So, there is quite a bit of customers that we are working directly 
with, but no specific collabs. 
 
Sanjyot Khare 
 
Sure. Thank you for that. And so this Q1, I mean, a s we got the positive PAT after long time, so is it  
going be like one off the quarter? Or are we seeing  going forward, we'll be having at least positive 
PAT? I mean, I'm not asking about how much it will be increasing or that we'll be maintaining this 
trend? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
So definitely, the effort is to maintain the trend now, see, because we got to this after a lot of like, I've 
been telling my team last quarter in tears. So, we are here now, so we wanna keep it sustained from 
here on. And I don't want to make it about onetime gains and all that. That quantum of it and so our 
effort, at least this management team is 100% going to pay to make sure that we keep the momentum 
right now. So, that's what because if you really think about it, there's been a lot of cleanup. 
 
Some of the big burn businesses, like TechView are not there with us anymore. So, we have gotten 
here, and I don't necessarily foresee anything majo r right now. But again, it remains to be seen. But 
effort is definitely going to see that we keep this momentum now. 
 
Sanjyot Khare 
 
Sure. Thank you. And my last question is about can you clarify on your strategy around M&A? I mean, 
are you actively looking for any M&A right now? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
M&A, again, I mean, we are not actively honestly in market. The one effort that we want to definitely 
make is, and I've said that in past as well, is tha t we do want to make sure that we can get some 
stabilization to our cap table. So, that's some effort that we will make. But other than that, we are not 
actively pursuing any M&A opportunity right now. 
 
Sanjyot Khare 
 
Thank you, Nisha. I will come back in the queue. All the best. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
All right. Thank you. 
 
Moderator 
 
Thank you. I request the participants to restrict with three questions in the initial round and join back 
the queue for more questions. 
 
The next question comes from Abhishek Kale, an individual investor. Please go ahead. 
6 
Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
Abhishek Kale 
 
Hey, Nisha, Harsha , Sumit, and Ramu. Good morning, everyone. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Good morning. 
 
Abhishek Kale 
 
Yeah. N isha, first question in the AGM, I had specifically  asked for a clarification from the then 
Chairman, Mr. Anil Singhvi, regarding the insider t rading. If we would want -- if I as a shareholder 
would like to get that investigated, can we do that ? And what would be the procedure for that? 
Because that question was specifically left unanswered. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
That is correct. The way it works, my understanding , Abhishek, is that the way you can get insider 
trading investigated, if that's what you kind of ha ve any suspicion around, would be that you would 
have to write to us because, typically, what happens is that I'm not sure, but we don't take cognizance 
of it on a call. We typically, you would have to put it in writing somewhere so that we can then take it 
up and I'm correct. Right, Ramu? 
 
Ramu Akkili 
 
Yeah. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Okay. I'm checking with Ramu as I also answer this question. But my understanding is that once you 
put it in writing, then we will take the steps to investigate it the way we need to. I think there are some 
processes around it, and we'll do the due course, investigation, whatever is required, and we'll take it 
up. 
 
But I think we can't take cognizance of it on a call, typically. We need to see it written somewhere. 
 
Abhishek Kale 
 
Understood. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
You have to almost, like, officially complain, I think, to audit committee. My understanding is it has to 
be written to audit committee. 
 
Abhishek Kale 
 
Understood. If needed, I'll do so. Second, a follow-up on that. We are talking about the cleanup. Right? 
Or I think, if I understand correctly, we are mostl y through with the cleanup as you said. Now, this 
legacy issue of insider trading, and what steps would the management do or what policies would they 
enforce to ensure that such a thing doesn't happen in the future? Because the disclosures that 
7 
Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
happened during the whole HyperSense and the licensing to subscription transition were horrendous. 
We got to know about those in the con call at the t ime of results, wherein, insiders had this 
information and they made a clean exit. 
 
So, what we would want as shareholders, if you're t alking about transparency, right, we would like 
this. Well, these are very price-sensitive informat ions. And if, the insiders are taking an action on it, I 
mean, the whole credibility of the organization goe s for a toss. Now that you are heading the 
organization, how can we ensure that we send a stro ng message to the insiders that enough is 
enough? And if this happens, the X Y Z action would be initiated type of. How can that be done? 
 
Ramu Akkili 
 
Yes, Abhishek. Let me answer to your query. We have a code of conduct internally. One has to follow 
the code of conduct. At the same time, if there is any UPSI, we have the trading window closure 
practices, which we have been following strictly. 
 
If there are any trades that will catch it and will inform to SEBI. Okay? For the past, we are not seeing 
such type of trading by the insiders. The one which  you are saying, I don't know about it. Once if 
somebody says about it, we'll look into it for the past matter. 
 
Abhishek Kale 
 
Okay. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Also, Abhishek, typically, we do have an SDD process where we don't make any PR or announcements 
unless they set a certain level of maturity, and it's strictly controlled. So, we don't announce any deals 
internally as well or we actually don't have anyone  before we tell the stock exchanges. So, it's very 
controlled. 
 
We are doing all the process. So, your allegation i s it probably happened despite that. So my point is  
that, we are following all the process, actually in ternally. But at any point of time, if you think th at 
there is something that we could do to strengthen o r if you have any questions because I'm seeing 
you raised this for the second time. I would say that in that case, you should write. 
 
Abhishek Kale 
 
This is the third time I'm raising this on a call, but I've not sent an email to Ramu or, I mean, the right 
group to have this checked. I'm sorry to interrupt,  Nisha, but I was specifically referring to not the  
deals portion of it, but on the things which are no t working out. I mean, we launched a new product. 
There was a huge buildup. And then as we all understand, some things did not work out. 
 
But then we got to know when everybody had made a clean exit. And the shareholders got to know it 
from Vinod at the time of con call. Right? And it happened with the licensing to subscription as well. I 
mean, these were the shockers that we got after the  fact, wherein everybody inside the company 
knew that this was coming, and they had a clean exit. 
 
And I'm talking specifically about the key manageme nt personnel and I've named the one who were 
the keys. And the previous CFO as well had made a clean exit.

Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
Ramu Akkili 
 
Thank you. Thank you, Abhishek. We have the policies strictly enforced. So, everybody, internally who 
has UPSI, is required to follow this. 
 
Abhishek Kale 
 
And then if you guys can assure that we are going t o make sure that these policies will be enforced 
then I'll keep a tab on how things are going on. Bu t, I mean, I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that  
everything goes as per plan. Okay. Now, coming to t he business end of the questions. What's that 
product roadmap for the next two years, Nisha, if you can? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Product roadmap, actually, we will be -- in fact, w hen we do the investor day, we'll share a lot of 
product roadmaps with you. We'll share it for every  product. Broadly speaking, if I were to explain it  
in a broader sense, we are trying to make -- what I wouldn't say trying to make, but we have made the 
AI pivot. 
 
So, what we are doing is we are making it all GenAI native. All the products will be GenAI native right 
now. So how do we make it? Obviously, every product is going to be a little different. Like, assurance 
is different from fraud management, which is different from our billing system. So, we are seeing what 
are the opportunities to make a GenAI native, more lighter version of products that don't have to go 
with hand in hand with very heavy implementation cycles. So, we are also rethinking our product suite 
in that sense. How do you build lighter? How do you deploy lighter? 
 
So, in terms of product roadmap, that's where we are headed broadly, but we'll happily share detailed 
product roadmaps with you when we do the investor day. 
 
Abhishek Kale 
 
Perfect. Two questions if I may squeeze in one extr a. The write-off we took for Sectrio. Any updates 
on that? Where are we on that? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
So on Sectrio, what we are doing is, like I said earlier, the write-off that we had taken off, I would say, 
the provision that we had made, we are pursuing that. I don't have honestly any updates to give there 
in the sense that I can't say that we have recovered the money yet, but we are pursuing it aggressively 
in all forms, I would say all means available to us right now to go and see what we can recover. 
 
So, all the efforts are on. I'm very aware that, th at needs to be recovered. So, we are taking all 
recourses, including legal where available. 
 
Abhishek Kale 
 
Okay. And one forward-looking statement, if you can give us, the magic number of INR 100 crores top-
line for the quarter. When do you see a likelihood of that happening? 
 
 
 
9 
Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
Nisha Dutt 
 
INR 100 crores? This has been my internal push as well to all my teams that I really truly, truly do want 
to see INR 100 crore quarter. It's not just an aspi rational thing. When can we get there? Honestly, if I 
knew it, I would tell you. But there is a strong push, Abhishek. , internally also, there is a strong push. 
 
All of us are pushing towards it. Our order intake last year was a little lukewarm. So, that's kind of  
what's reflecting in our top-line numbers this year  because a lot of our business is backlog based. 
Right? So, hopefully, I'm thinking that since this year, we have a more robust order book. We might 
be able to do something hopefully next year. 
 
Abhishek Kale 
 
Great. And Nisha, one last question. How much? 
 
Moderator 
 
I'm sorry to interrupt sir, Mr. Abhishek. 
 
Abhishek Kale 
 
I'll join back the queue. I'll join back. Thank you. 
 
Moderator 
 
Thank you, sir. The next question comes from Mahesh Kumar, an individual investor. Please go ahead. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
Yeah. Good morning, Nisha. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Good morning. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
First question is, what is the order book as on November 1 and what is the order funnel? 
 
Second question is in Q1 investor call up to FY2425 , you have mentioned that you have invested in 
Privasapien, which is basically data protection and  privacy related to AI. So, what is the intention o f 
Subex investing in that company? And are you going to integrate their technology into Subex product 
for telecom market? 
 
Nisha Du" 
 
Okay. In terms of order book, Mahesh, I can't -- as you can imagine, I can't disclose the order book 
because this call is picked up. This is a public ca ll. Right? It's picked up not just by shareholders.  It's 
also picked up by competition. 
 
 
10 
Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
But generally, all companies disclose this order funnel and what is order book as on last year. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
No, I already reported -- all the material orders have been reported to the extent of INR 15 million we 
have reported. Obviously, the order book is larger.  But, at least so wherever it's material or needs t o 
be disclosed, we have been disclosing it, Mahesh. I n terms of order funnel, I believe I continue to 
believe that this year, we have seen an actual upti ck, like I said earlier as well. So, order funnel 
continues to be strong, actually, this year. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
See, what happens is if you disclose all this infor mation, then we get idea what is happening in the 
company. See, ultimately, what matters is the money in bank account. Whether your product is great, 
you are in the magic quadrant and all that, that is immaterial. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Which I think is good. You would agree. Right? If we have INR 135 crores in bank right now. So, I think 
we have strong liquidity position. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
Like you are saying, you are going to do some clean up, so some money of that will evaporate now. 
Just now you mentioned, some cleanup will be done. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Yeah. I mean, I don't -- I mean, whatever will happ en, it's not cash related. You will not see the 
evaporation of cash. That I can tell you. So, unless we make investment. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
All BSE- or NSE-listed company, if you take Intellect Design , they give order book as well as they do 
order funnel. Same is with the startup companies li sted in Australian stock exchange as well as 
American stock exchange. Are you saying that they are not afraid of their competitors? 
 
Order book gives us idea that what is outcome of wo rk done by your team? An order funnel tells us 
what is the roadmap of your team to capture the mar ket. Unless this information is given, we are 
actually totally blank. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Okay. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
See, I have given you at least five, six presentations which are list ed on Indian stock exchanges, also 
on global stock exchanges. There, they are disclosi ng. If you see Intellect Design Arena presentation,  
11 
Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
that is the best presentation in India. And he told, again, I will reach 30% net profit margin, and he has 
reached. 
 
See, that is what is required. Getting orders is okay. That is you announced just after AGM. But I have 
been requesting this order book and order funnel for last three years. 
 
Sumit Kumar 
 
Okay, Mahesh. What we will do is, Mahesh, so if you  see, our investor deck is actually enriched now 
and gives additional information. And, regarding yo ur request about the order book, the current 
status. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
Order book and order funnel. 
 
Sumit Kumar 
 
Order funnel, both we will look into that. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
No. But this answer, I am getting for last eight, nine quarters, we will look into. And see, SEBI has not 
prohibited you from doing all these things, neither exchanges. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
No. I never actually said that, SEBI. So this, I do n't consider as forward-looking. This is more sensi tive 
to me from a competition point of view. Because whe n I give you order funnel and things like that -- 
see, this is a small market that we are in, Mahesh. The truth is that the market that we are serving, we 
are working in a duopoly situation. So we are there , and there is one big competitor. And then 
everyone else is a distant third force. Right? 
 
And they are all unlisted. So, they are under no ob ligation. See, my competition is all unlisted. They  
are all private. They are under no obligation to di sclose anything and we are in a tough market right 
now. So anything that it's not to keep it away from  you. My point is that anything that I say, it's ve ry 
easy for somebody to extrapolate what orders or what deals I'm changing right now. 
 
And hence, we try to maintain some confidentiality around it. It's not to necessarily keep information 
from you. And that's why I've been saying, I've alw ays been very transparent even in past. When the 
order book was lukewarm, I came back and said that it was lukewarm. 
 
Now, I'm telling you it's robust. That's because it's actually picked up. I've always been transparent to 
that extent, but to actually talk about specific nu mbers, it's almost like, see, we work on a backlog 
basis. Right? If I give you the order book, anybody can then tomorrow stand there and calculate what 
I'm going to tell you in Q4. 
 
It's that sensitive. And that's why I would like to  keep some confidentiality around it. I hope to 
understand that's what we are trying to do. It's no t to keep information away, but we need to be 
sensitive enough for the market that we are working in.

Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
See, you can share the outcome of the work in some other way also. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
We are actually sharing. Right? I mean, all the sig nificant deals we have announced, actually. So, 
wherever I feel that you need to know, we do announ ce, in fact. We took the feedback from 
shareholders. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
Last investor call, you have done some announcement . I'm not disagreeing that. So, that 
announcement, you have done. So, on that front, there is an improvement. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Okay. So, maybe I can answer your Privasapien quest ion because on Privasapien, it was a good area 
when we invested earlier. We are constantly monitor ing it for integration opportunities in telco, but 
that's generally the journey, actually. We haven't taken them to our customers right now or fit their 
product into us. So, we have not done any kind of integration right now. 
 
Actually, that's the conversation we have been having with that founder. Honestly, we haven't found 
a very clean opportunity, but we continue to look for one. So currently, as it stands, it's an investment, 
which I think is in a sort of convergence with us. Investment cases, at that time, my belief was, or a t 
least I wasn't there, but my understanding of inves tment thesis or the one that we continue to hold 
right now is that we are working in an area which is actually becoming extremely important as we go 
forward. Right? 
 
As a number of AI models in each and every telco an d company increases disproportionately, what 
will happen is the security around the AI models an d GenAI security will become more and more 
important because your attack surfaces for the comp anies increases. And what Privasapien does is 
exactly kind of work in that area where they secure your AI and GenAI model. So, I think that as areas 
go, it has very high potential. 
 
Harsha Angeri 
 
And just to add, I think the only thing that we also monitor is the question remains as to whether this 
layer of security will remain outside the LLMs, or will the LLMs kind of bring it inside? And we spend  
constant time with them, understanding what their progress is, where have they been within clients, 
what are their delivery and so on. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
Okay. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
So, we continue to believe that they are in a good market, actually. They are also in a market that's 
very forward-looking in something.

Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
What is the percentage stake Subex is holding at the moment? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
2.6%. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
So, there is no plan to increase it? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Not currently, actually. Because I think, any cash that we throw up, I mean, we have ourselves enough 
investment areas internally identified where I would want to plough back the cash. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
Yeah. Because, see, that AI security is going to become the very important area in future. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
That's correct. Absolutely. And that's why we continue to hold that stake. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
So, if we invest now in a bigger chunk, say, up to 25% and around that, so you will have the say on the 
road map of the company and how to integrate into our products. See, that will give a differentiation 
in the market. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Yeah, I hear you, but the thing is that our money is -- I mean, we have a lot of our own aspirations and 
roadmaps identified, Mahesh, and I would rather inv est it back and plough it back into our product 
suite because my span of control on our product and the markets that we deal with is so much higher, 
right, than when you are investing outside. So I think in that sense, I think we will make that call as we 
as we go forward. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
That is security is very important area. See, if so me other traditional security company invest in tha t 
and then you don't have any say, that will put you at this 2% is of no use. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
I still think it will be of good use, actually. As their valuation improves, we'll actually stand to gain from 
it.

But see, if they dilute the equity. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
That will be a subsequent route. If we think that, we ne ed to up our stake at that point of time, we'll 
make that call. Yeah. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
If they dilute the stake then your stake will come down to point 0.2% or something like that. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
No. That's correct. That's what we have right to up  our stake in the subsequent rounds. So, when he 
goes to do higher fund raise, we'll take a call. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
So, what I was suggesting you, you have this on your whiteboard because this is the area which any AI 
company will need. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Correct. Yeah. 
 
Harsha Angeri 
 
That is correct. Yeah.

Okay. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Thank you. 
 
Moderator 
 
Thank you. I request the participants to restrict with three questions in the initial round and join back 
the queue for more questions. 
 
The next question comes from Gokul P from Subex. Please go ahead. 
 
Gokul P 
 
Hello. Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity.  So, I have three questions. One is could you 
explain why there's a YoY decrease in the APAC region revenue? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Sorry. Could you repeat? I didn't catch that. I'm sorry. I didn't catch it. Could you please say that again? 
 
Gokul P 
 
Yeah. The YoY decrease in the revenue from the APAC region and the rest of the world. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Okay. What's the next question? 
 
Gokul P 
 
Could you explain why there's a -- what the reason for decrease? Like, is there you have lost some 
anchor customer? Or is it just like a YoY thing and it will recover in coming quarters? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
No. I mean, we have -- like I've said before also, we have zero churn right now. So, we have not lost 
any customers, but it's the nature of QoQ. Right? Some quarters, you have more MS. Sometimes  you 
have some PR set down. So, it's the nature of what kind of work that you are doing in every region. 
It's not reflective of losing any customers per se.  So, this kind of small variations you will see acr oss 
quarters or in regions. 
 
Sumit Kumar 
 
So, you can see YoY, the decline is largely the non-telco, which, the sector business that we are talking. 
And, as a strategic decision, we came up. But from a telco business, if you see our investor text also , 
which is holding it up, but there's some marginal d ecline based on the nature of the some managed 
services or, let's say, implementation services or broadly, the revenues are holding it up. 
16 
Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Yeah. 
 
Sumit Kumar 
 
Yeah. 
 
Gokul P 
 
Okay. Understood. And secondly, on the monthly recurring revenue, we used to report it about a year 
ago, and we have stopped reporting it over the past  few quarters. So, is there any increase in the 
revenue? Because last time we talked about it, you mentioned that it takes about a year for these 
projects to be implemented and get reflected in the numbers. 
 
So, is there any increase in the revenue rate or is it still flat? And when would you see change towards? 
 
Sumit Kumar 
 
Yeah. Currently, it's more or less flat because sti ll we not really converted the entire revenue to th e 
subscription and all because there is bulk of the implementations that is still on. And as we explained 
earlier also, it's the large implementations that a re there. So, once you finish the implementation 
cycle, then only the subscriptions or support services start. So, still from that angle, it is there. 
 
There's a small uptick in there, but it is, I will say it is broadly in the range of the similar which we used 
to report earlier. That's why we stopped reporting because it's just not giving the real outcome to that. 
So, once we catch it up, we'll start thinking about reporting that piece. 
 
Gokul P 
 
And could you, like, guide in how many quarters we can see a change in the numbers? 
 
Sumit Kumar 
 
Which number you're saying? The MRS? 
 
Gokul P 
 
Yes. 
 
Sumit Kumar 
 
Maybe another three, four quarters from now. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Yeah. 
 
 
 
 
17 
Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
Gokul P 
 
Okay . Understood. Thirdly, before this also about a few quarters back, you had mentioned that there's 
a few of old timers in the sales team. There is som e inflexibility in them. And since we are overall 
having a change in the entire company regarding the independent directors and the sales team every 
year, so is there going to be some replacements or new hires? 
 
Broadly, will you be looking to replace the sales team that you had referred to in a few quarters back? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
We have actually. Right? I mean, the sales side has  been on-boarded as of I think last week. So, the 
head of sales himself has been changed. And I think  we are making some other changes as well on 
downstream. 
 
But, again  as you can imagine, it's not going to be a 100% turnover. It's going to be, we'll do it in parts. 
But we haven't already made quite a few changes. So  when I think of the reset, it's true. I think that  
we have a board level reset. We have a management reset that's going on. We have a band level reset. 
So there are resets that are happening, product portfolio. So, we are looking at it comprehensively. 
 
Gokul P 
 
Okay. Thank you. And finally, about the Sectrio. So , we had two contracts, and one was almost near 
negotiation for closure. So, as the closure happened, could you please update on that? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
We are almost done. They are just dotting the I's, crossing the T's. We are almost done. So with one, 
we are done. The other one, we are in the recovery process, as I mentioned before. 
 
Gokul P 
 
Okay. Thank you so much for the updates. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Thank you.

Ajay Doshi 
 
Hello? 
 
 
 
18 
Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Hi, Ajay. 
 
Ajay Doshi 
 
Hello? Yes. Am I audible? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Yes. You are. 
 
Ajay Doshi 
 
Thank you. Namaste to all. Madam, thanks for your views presented, past, and, looking ahead for the 
future. AI is your product and AI is the word which is used everywhere in all newspapers and journals. 
This is going to be the future. It seems presently.  Now with AI in the driver's seat for you in teleco m, 
have you thought about diversifying? See, what view s I'm presenting is my personal. It's not binding 
on you, but just my views after reading this financial newspapers and journals. 
 
Is company developing any product in in other field , such as legal, education, defence or power? 
There's a big focus. Now, in the end, you can summarize if you wish, but just emphasize, power test is 
a very alarming issue in this country. Transition a nd distribution, where lakhs of millions of watts o f 
units are being taken away by TESS. 
 
There are big power companies, Adani, Torrent, Tata's and JSW Energy. And I view this as big business 
for the future. If company is thinking of diversifying from telecom to other businesses, these are going 
to be future business, legal, education and defence. Madam, effects of changes in U.S. law, H-1B visa 
fee hike and higher act. 
 
So, I would like to know your views affecting this company where you have a product in America, a 
company in America also. Your vision for the future, you have presented. Gold and silver, I'm confident 
you will take Subex to new heights in the years to come. 
 
Thank you very much. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Thank you, Ajay. Thank you for that code of confide nce. So, just to answer your question in terms of 
adjacencies. So, telco adjacencies are, see, when you talk about defence or legal or education, 
I don't think of them as adjacencies. They are like new verticals by themselves, actually. 
 
And where we have been focused on is telco adjacencies. So, like I've also mentioned before, a lot of 
people have asked me earlier also, why don't you move away from telco? And I always feel that telco 
first and then adjacencies. The reason is because if I look at the amount of growth or the quantum of 
growth that I really need right now, I think we hav e more than enough headroom actually where we 
are. We just need to make sure that we make it happen. 
 
And, again, when I talk about adjacencies, there are sectors like, telco wallets. I'm talking about which 
is, kind of fintechs, telco fintechs. I am talking about OTT, which is  all your Netflixes and Amazon Prime 
and all these platforms. So, we are looking at adjacencies. 
19 
Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
 
The challenge of going into entirely new domain. Right? Let's take, for example, legal, is truly that, the 
GTM, the cost of actually cracking a market open is  extremely high when you do not have domain 
knowledge in a certain domain. And that becomes a big factor for us. So, where I want to go is to make 
sure that, first of all, my current suite of produc ts can horizontally scale into that domain. So for 
instance, if I do fraud investigations or I do frau d management, right, my fraud management can 
actually go into a fintech or a wallet because it's like transaction monitoring. 
 
It's very easy for me to horizontally scale my prod uct into that. But can I horizontally scale a fraud  
management product into education? I'm not sure. An d do I understand enough about that domain 
to be able to go crack it at a low GTM cost? Again, I am not sure because it's many steps removed from 
where we are. 
 
So, we are actually thinking about some of these things. This is constantly a debate internally as well. 
But where we are, I'm looking more in terms of adja cencies right now, looking at bad debt. How do 
you create AI model for bad debt, for instance? 
 
Can I take that to fintech and finance institutions? Yes. Answer is yes. But can I take it to a legal? I am 
not sure. So, those are opportunities we are evaluating. But, again, I wanna make sure that whatever 
we do, we don't do it at the cost of very high GTM. Right? Your if your GTM cost goes very high, it kind 
of defeats the purpose. 
 
So, we are building today, and I take your point in  consideration. I think these are industries of the  
future, but I feel that where we are headed as a product company in terms of making sure that we are 
able to fight fraud very, very effectively across domains, I think that is also the future. 
 
I'm taking a big bet on that because I feel that we are experiencing it every day. Right? Right from your 
delivery frauds to your WhatsApp frauds to your SMS, the fraud is all pervasive. And the more that AI 
agents come into play, this is only going to get worse, actually. 
 
So, I think in that sense, our bet on the future is to see if we can be the efficient machine that actually 
fights fraud for telco and for adjacencies and for, I would say, even financial sector in future. So, that 
is where our biggest bet is, actually. So it's more, I would say, a domain that we have picked in a place 
that we have, I would say, cut our teeth and for last 30 years, we have cut our teeth on fraud. 
 
And this sector, we understand this domain. We unde rstand, we know how to fight fraud, and that 
would horizontally scale into sectors where we need  to take it. So, that's how we are taking a bet 
instead of trying to figure out what product I should build for a legal sector. I would rather take what 
I know and see how I can horizontally scale it into  other things. So, that's pretty much the kind of 
approach that we are taking right now. So that was your question. 
 
Okay. I think I probably answered that. 
 
Ajay Doshi 
 
Effect of changes in US law. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
US laws, actually, honestly, it hasn't directly affected us too much because most of our -- my bill team 
is actually sitting in Bangalore next to us. So, we  haven't had major challenges. We have had some 
20 
Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
hiccups in the sense that sometimes when we have to  deploy resources on-site, we have had some 
visa challenges and all that, but nothing insurmoun table right now. I'm not seeing any direct impact 
to our business, honestly, from that perspective, at least. 
 
Ajay Doshi 
 
It's okay. Thank you very much, madam. But just kee p a small note in your notebook regarding this 
diversification in power transmission and distribution losses.

Sure. Okay. Point taken. Thank you, Ajay. Thank you.

Thank you. The next question comes from Jitendra Bhutoria, an individual investor. Please go ahead. 
 
Jitendra Bhutoria 
 
Good morning. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Good morning. Please go ahead, Jitendra. We can't h ear you. Moderator, are you able to hear 
Jitendra? 
 
Jitendra Bhutoria 
 
Can you hear me? Yeah. Can you hear me? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Yeah. Now, we can hear you. Yes. 
 
Jitendra Bhutoria 
 
Yeah. Sorry. My first question is regarding Sectrio. We had two contracts. One was already closed. The 
other was on the brink of closure. Now, what is the  status on that? And, what is the amount 
recoverable so far the second contract is concerned? The first one you said, we had taken a write-off, 
and, still you are trying to recover that money. Bu t what about the second one? What is the amount 
recoverable? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Actually, we have no recovery. So, when I said two contracts to be closed, it didn't mean that we have 
money to be recovered from there. We have only in o ne contract, which we have taken a provision 
21 
Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
for. You are aware of that in Q4. The other one was  we were only trying to wind down our services 
there. We have no recovery to make from there, actually. 
 
The money has come. Everything is cleaned there. We  are just trying to wind down our services so 
that we can exit the contract in a more elegant way . That was the only closure that we were looking 
for. There was no recovery process there. 
 
Jitendra Bhutoria 
 
What is the ti meline you expect to close this, the second one? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
It's like I said, it's almost done dotting the I's, crossing the T's. We are hoping to wind it out this quarter. 
 
Jitendra Bhutoria 
 
This quarter only. Okay. And the second thing is, y ou were talking about, we had invested in this 
Middle-East subsidiary recently. So, what do you think, this could spell out in numbers, so far the next 
two quarter number? When do you think that it will be at good revenues by this quarter? 
 
Sumit Kumar 
 
So, Middle-East subsidiary as we explained last tim e as well, it is more about supporting that entity 
for their working capital need. And all our contrac ting structure is the subsidiaries typically sign u p 
contracts with the end-customer. And the revenue then flows down based on the global transparency 
norms around on this. Okay? So this entity, since i t has a bit of a network issue, so that's what we 
supported to capitalize that entity. 
 
The businesses broadly remain same. This money which we have spent, it is within the group because 
it is more about the recapitalization and supporting that entity is viable enough to take the subsequent 
contract. That's what we did it. As Nisha was expla ining earlier also, we do have revenue challenges 
and growth, but our order books now look pretty strong. So, hopefully, we will turn, and Middle-East 
market for us is a key market. So, any growth in that market will basically go through this entity while 
we capitalize. 
 
 
Jitendra Bhutoria  
 
One more question. I remember in one of the con calls, it was told that receivable was stuck because 
of foreign exchange in some geography like Burma, maybe some other geography. What is the status 
on that, and what are the amounts that were to be recoverable receivable? 
 
Sumit Kumar 
 
So, that issue is now sorted because, typically, th ere are certain regions where we work where the 
money or dollars are not there in that country. For  whatever reason, it would be a country-specific 
issues or it's like a geopolitical issue. So, it's like a business as usual. Maybe that particular qua rter 
which we reported, that has issue. Now, everything is clean, and we don't find -- there are few delays 
in the collection happening, but that we closely monitor. But currently, we don't have any kind of that 
issue. 
 
22 
Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Yeah. We don't have any contracts right now that are stuck. 
 
Jitendra Bhutoria 
 
So that is all sorted out. That means whatever was stuck maybe long back recovered. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
It sorted out and also Jitendra, we also proactively don't go into countries where we feel that currency 
is going to be a challenge. So, there are also places where we have walked away because we felt that 
we really cannot recover our money from here. So in  those places, we have also walked away from. 
So, we are taking that call because there is no point in doing work and not being able to recover your 
money later. 
 
Jitendra Bhutoria 
 
Correct. One more thing. We have a goodwill of about INR 196 crore on the balance sheet.

Ajay Desai 
 
Yeah. Good afternoon, Nisha. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Hi, Ajay. 
 
Ajay Desai 
 
Hi. I actually missed the opening statement which you gave. So, just I am trying to get an understanding 
about the status of the board appointment for the vacant seats. 
23 
Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
Nisha Dutt 
 
So, I said in the opening, Ajay, that before the Q3 call, we should have board reconstituted. The point 
I was making was that I have received a lot of ques tions offline as well from the shareholders saying 
that why haven't you appointed the Board yet? So, m y point was that let's not do it in a hurry. It 
doesn't make sense for filling the seat just for the sake of it. We have a direction that we have received 
from shareholders in the sense of I understand what  you're looking for in the Board, and we'll make 
sure that, we find the right fit of people for that. 
 
So, it might take us some time, but I'm still hopin g to fill all the positions before the next board 
meeting. 
 
Ajay Desai 
 
Sure. So, we would love to have people coming from technocrat background with a renowned face in

Thank you. The next question comes from Patrick Mathias, an individual investor. Please go ahead. 
 
Patrick Mathias 
 
Yeah. We alr eady mentioned that we have 150-customer reach, global reach, and I've been seeing this 
statement for quite some time. In reality, how many customers are we practically engaging with? And 
which customers currently are active customers? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
So, when we say 150 customers, it would be that num ber. The way we calculate that number is that 
do they have an install base? Are they working with one or more of our products? And do we have an 
AMC coming from there? And do we have an active billing going on with those customers? 
 
In terms of engagement, to answer your question, ty pically, with all our, I would say the important 
and top customers, we have a process where we do a quarterly review. We call it a QBR process. We 
quarterly actually get on a call with them, the ser vices team. We'll get on a call with them and give 
them updates about what's new in our products and a lso hear any feedback. So, we do have an 
engagement mechanism which happens in different ways.

I would like more specific answers in terms of how many customers are we practically engaged?

When you say engaged, do you mean that how many customers are in business today? 
 
Patrick Mathias 
 
I have been in sales for 30 years in global MNC. So, please give some direct answers. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
No. I'm asking you, are you asking that how many people are paying us today? Is that your question?

No. I'm asking how many customers does your sales team actively engage with? We can simply define 
that they have met the customer. They are talking t o the customer. There are active deals being 
spoken about. 
 
That's where the funnel will come from. The 150 num ber makes no sense if there is no sales team 
engaged with the customer. There is always a long t ail of number of customers and there is a set of 
active customers. Being in sales, I've always known that it's 80:20 rule where 20 customers always are 
the top customers that have business potential. The balance is just a list. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Which is correct. I mean, your understanding is abs olutely bang on. So, we do have sales team that 
engage with customers on a periodic basis. You're also right about the 80:20. 
 
Hello? Are you able to hear us? 
 
Patrick Mathias 
 
Yeah. Yeah, ma'am. Yes. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Okay. So, what happens is that the customer engagement happens in two levels, right, for us? One is 
sales and other is services because our services is also actively engaged with customers. So, wherever 
there are opportunities, let's say, of PRs and all that, our services is actually handling it. Where t here 
is an opportunity of a fresh sale or a product upgrade and all that, that's where our sales guys handle 
it. 
 
But in terms of pipeline build, just so you get a s ense of our engagement with customers, typically, 
sales guys have a target of building a 4x or 5x pip eline. So, let's say that if I want them to do INR 10 
million in a year, I'm just giving you example, then a sales guy would have to build a pipeline of INR 40 
million to INR 50 million for me. And that would me an that that's the quantum of engagement 
25 
Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
everyone would have because they need to bring that pipeline given our conversion rates and all that. 
Right? 
 
So, we always have an active pipeline discussion. W e have pipeline building. So, obviously, some are 
more active conversations which are near-term conve rsions. And then there are conversations that 
you are baking in parallel to convert in future qua rters. If you were to ask me, I cannot put a number  
to it right now, but I can definitely tell you that our pipeline tracking is at four to five times of the order 
intake that we are looking to do in a particular year. 
 
Patrick Mathias 
 
So third question, going back to the question that I think my issue is named, we are interested upon 
sharing of certain more details. We are not asking for names of customers which can have competitive 
issues. What people are asking for is the size of the pipeline that you have. What is the funnel you are 
working on? When we are saying that we will reach I NR 100 crores, targeting at maybe 20% growth 
over last year, we should have a pipeline. Okay? 
 
As investors, I personally have invested in this co mpany for over 12 years. I am where I am, where I 
was 12 years ago. So when we ask, we would want to know whether in terms of growth, is there an 
order pipeline? Is there a funnel, 1:5 or whatever is the conversion ratio in place progressing because 
that is a real matrix which will give us some real answers? Otherwise, we have been attending 
conference calls. We have been looking at fancy presentations for years on end now. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Right. So, see, in terms of funnel, we are typicall y targeting in a for instance, in this year, we are  
targeting a funnel of INR 180 million to INR 200 mi llion, if that answers your question. So, typically , 
that's the range in which we want our funnel built. In terms of what I think see, again, we are building 
a funnel to that quantum. How much of that percenta ge we will convert, actually, when will it come 
for conversion? 
 
These are things that we are closely monitoring. But beyond that, I think, or at least our view was that 
what is more material to you as shareholders and what you can actually reliably act upon is when I do 
a deal disclosure to you. Right? That's the deal that's in my bag. 
 
I know that there is going to certain revenue that will come against that deal. Correct? So, I would 
think that that gives you a much better clarity in what to expect in coming quarters when we announce 
deal wins. My funnel, I can tell you, it's INR 180 million to INR 200 million but does that give you a ny 
better clarity in terms of how my revenues are buil t up? If it does, then I'm happy to tell you that 
number. But we weren't really sure how it helps. So, that's the point of view. 
 
Patrick Mathias 
 
So, given whatever is our experience in Subex, thin g is we have always had lot of surprise. So, one of  
the metrics is that if we are targeting some amount of revenue, there has to be a funnel that backs it 
up. Now whether the conversion ratio is 1:5, 1:10, 1:20 can vary. But the least -- bare minimum, least 
common denominator is there is an active funnel in place. That's how it helps. 
 
 
 
 
26 
Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Absolutely. I mean, I agree with you. 100% agree wi th you. And when we do our AOPs as well, we 
typically when we do our budgeting exercise, whatev er revenue target we end up taking with the 
Board is obviously backed by the pipeline and the funnels that we have. Right? 
 
We wouldn't want to take a target that we cannot ac tually deliver to later. Of course, as the year 
unfolds, we see a lot of hits and misses, and that' s how the year unfolds. Sometimes the timing of 
deals get flipped away. So, like it happened to us last year. So, those are things that we control to the 
extent we can, but I kind of -- I can assure you that anytime we take any target, it's backed by a funnel. 
It's backed by a pipeline. I mean, we otherwise, I don't know we'll be working in vacuum otherwise. 
 
So, that's always there. There is a diligence. Ther e is a process behind it. In fact, I can tell you t hat 
every two weeks, we actually meet just for funnel d iscussion. There is a big funnel call that happens.  
It's called a pipeline discussion that we do with o ur sales guy on a consistent biweekly, we do it. So , 
there is a cadence around it. It starts very closely. A lot of our revenues and everything depends on it. 
So, quite aware, but if it helps you, then it's around 180 to 200 is what we are tracking. Right? 
 
Patrick Mathias 
 
Sure. Thanks. It does help because in the past, we have been mid from a year. That is the reason that 
that trust issue comes from. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Again, I can only speak for since I have been here,  I feel that I've been my approach has been quite 
direct. At least I've been candid with all of you. I can only say that. The intention is not to tell you one 
thing and do something else. That's why I've been very candid generally in my conversation. So, what 
I can share, the idea is never to mislead or mislead. 
 
Patrick Mathias 
 
Yeah. Okay. Thanks a lot. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Thank you.

Thank you. We have a follow-up question from Sanjyot Khare, an individual investor. Please go ahead. 
 
Sanjyot Khare 
 
So, I have a follow-up. So, in one of the question,  Nisha, you mentioned that, it's good that we have 
one good order, like, about $12 million or $15 million, which is around INR 120 crores. Are we seeing 
that any of these new orders, are we gonna realize any revenue from Q3 onwards or revenue will be 
starting only from the next financial year for these orders? 
 
 
 
27 
Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
Sumit Kumar 
 
So, typically, this order, which is when we reporte d, it is a large order, ranges from four years to f ive 
years. And in that, there are certain renewals orders. So, basically, like, our annuity wise is strong. We 
keep winning that. So that renewal orders, there wi ll be some revenue, but you will not get the 
revenue growth per se. It is more about the maintaining the revenue. So, that is one piece. 
 
And then if there's implementation related orders o ut there, we'll start translating some portion of 
the revenue in this year. And, then, obviously, once it's complete, then the other piece of subscriptions 
and other comes. So, obviously, there will be some percentage will get converted this year around on 
this. Yeah. 
 
Sanjyot Khare 
 
Thank you for that. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Yeah. Even you will see some percentage of, like, 20%, 30 % gets converted in the year, and then rest 
of it gets spilled over to next year. This is how we like I was saying, we are in a business of backlog. So, 
what it means is that in the beginning of the year, I know where 80% of the revenues will come from. 
We have quite a bit of certainty. We enter the year  with that, and then the fight is for the rest 20% 
and all that. 
 
So, that's typically how it works. Our business is like that. 
 
Sanjyot Khare 
 
Sure. I was hoping that, like, because of yeah, at least 20% kind can be realized in this financial ye ar, 
maybe 80% later. So that's a good thing. And the th ing about, I think your Subex customer event is 
coming up next week, probably. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
That's right. 
 
Sanjyot Khare 
 
And I hope you get a good response, many customers are joining for that. So like that, even one of the 
call you mentioned that you, Subex, is planning to host the meetings with analyst and institutional 
investors. So, are you planning to do that also in this quarter, next quarter, or as things are gettin g 
better now? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
That's the plan. We will come up with our engagement plan because as you must have noticed earlier 
in the call that we do have investor relation agenc y now on board with us. So, we are carving out a 
plan with them on how we go to market, how we engag e with investors. So, there is a plan that we 
are putting together. But as a first step, we defin itely wanted to see if we can do an outreach to our  
current shareholders at least and meet them since I think we have generally not met in person at all. 
 
28 
Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
So, this is also your opportunity to come and see y our own company. So, that's the first step for us, 
and we are going to come up with a roadshow plan subsequently. 
 
Sanjyot Khare 
 
Yeah. Sure. That's gonna be really nice. I mean, it should be happening after a long time. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Yeah. 
 
Sanjyot Khare 
 
I have it. I mean, again, you're answering to one of the questions that whether Subex is fine to diversify 
into any other domains and I completely understand.  I mean, you have a technology to go into the 
market and have sales team and all these things to drive. 
 
Moderator 
 
I'm sorry to interrupt, sir. Your voice is not clear. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Yeah. Your voice is not clear. It's cutting off. I'm unable to understand. 
 
Sanjyot Khare 
 
Can you hear me? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Yes. 
 
Sanjyot Khare 
 
Can you hear me? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Yes. 
 
Sanjyot Khare 
 
Yeah. Sorry for that. Now I was just saying, I'm just repeating that one of the question about whether 
Subex is going to diversify into any other domains. And completely understand it's a huge cost involved 
into, taking products into the newer markets for th e company. So, the company already having a 
product and technology. So, is company thinking to license the product or technology to current 
partners who are already in those different domains? 
 
29 
Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
For example, Tech Mahindra probably is a partner into telecom, but they also have a domain whether 
it's banking, insurance, retail, and they can take the product to that, whether licensing or the 
technology to different companies. What are you thinking about that? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Actually, honestly, we do work with Tech Ms and oth er partners, SIs as well. Are we actively thinking 
of licensing? We haven't really had those conversations, to be honest, because the way our products 
are built, it can be horizontally scaled, but that' s not without actually production, I would say, 
development effort. 
 
So today, it's very designed for a certain kind of customer. So, if I want to take the same product an d 
take it to entirely new domain, it would require a lot of development effort at our end. It's not 
something that I can license out, and they would be able to just do a lift. So, our product is not designed 
like that, actually, so currently. 
 
Sanjyot Khare 
 
Okay. Got it. Thank you for that. All the best. 
 
Nisha Dutt

Abhishek Kale 
 
Hey. Am I audible? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Yes , you are. 
 
Abhishek Kale 
 
Hi, Nisha. Follow-up. We have a large amount of cash sit ting on our books. I am not sure if there are 
any regulatory hurdles which prevent us from doing a buyback or paying out dividends. So, can you or 
Sumit, anybody explain more about that? 
 
Sumit Kumar 
 
So basically, yes, there's a regulatory hurdle beca use the company retained earnings is still negative . 
So, there's a buyback provision is there whereby it  has to be funded out of the retained earnings. So 
unfortunately, we are not there. We are a negative trajectory. And with this year, it's piling it up. So 
hopefully, in a couple of years, we'll recover and back to the profitability trajectory. So, that is actually 
a regulatory issue.

Coming back to the funds in the balance sheet right  now, currently, we are doing more about the 
treasury call and do the idle money investment on t he respective scripts around on that. But having 
said that, now and I'll leave Nisha to add on, basically, whole idea is to get the profitability back, which 
we have done now. So, this money will work on reinvesting into the businesses, which will give us the 
next level of growth. 
 
Abhishek Kale 
 
Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. We have a follow-up question from Mahesh  Kumar, an individual investor. Please go 
ahead. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
Yeah. Nisha , you mentioned that in Investor Day, you are going to make presentation on the product 
roadmap. Is this correct? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
That's correct. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
So, what is the investment required for all these d ifferent product developments is first question. 
Second question, how much revenue each product is g oing to generate? Are you going to share this 
information in the Investor Day? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
I haven't actually designed it yet, but to the exte nt, it's appropriate to share, we will share. I mea n, 
currently, all the products are self-funded. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
So, why I am asking this question because we should not go into the same track like IoT and IT centre. 
 
Nisha Du" 
 
Oh, yeah. Absolutely. No. Absolutely. These product s are getting built on our own. So for instance, I 
already have a revenue assurance product. So, the r oadmap for revenue assurance might -- we'll 
present that to tell you how we are planning to bui ld that product out further and what kind of 
industries it will help us unlock. So, what additional time I can unlock, for instance. That I can give, I'll 
be happy to share that with every product roadmap, what additional time taken. 
31 
Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
Why I am asking this question because any new produ ct development, generally, people do the 
analysis of cost benefit analysis. If I invest INR 1 crore in this product development, what is the factor 
I will get the return on that? If such analysis is being done because we should not enter into area 
where we will burn the cash again and again 
and clean the balance sheet. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
No. Absolutely right. Actually, one of the first decisions when we said that we have to exit some of the 
businesses, maybe you recollect, Mahesh, that I had mentioned that we always do our IRR calculation. 
Right? And that IRR calculation was not adding up for me on the businesses that we ended up exiting 
because that wasn't adding up. 
 
So, I am very conscious of this, and we always do our IRR calculation before we will invest any money 
because you're absolutely right. We cannot be in this cycle where we invest in products and then they 
don't yield us any benefit. So, that discipline we have, 100%. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
Whatever new products you are contemplating or envisaging, is th ere any feedback from the 
customer? Are they really needing such thing in future? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
We don't build in isolation at all, actually. So, t ypically, what we do is we call it building with th e 
customer. We'll take a multi-customer. We'll POC, b uild with them. We'll take feedback and sort of 
build further. So, it's very iterative process beca use I completely believe that we don't know 
everything, and we are not going to build it and hope that they come sometime. 
 
So, that's definitely not what we do. Even in the UC that we have coming up next week, right, the user 
conference, we are going to do a voice of customer. So, there is a process. We call it voice of customer 
where we collect data from customers on a periodic basis on usability of our product, what features 
they would like to see, what else are we missing. So, this is a standardized, I would say, a very rigorous 
process that we do, and we'll be repeating this in our UC. 
 
Actually, we have a session around POC where we'll go and collect information. So, definitely agree 
with you. We don't build and just hope that somebody will come by it. I mean, that's not how we are 
going to build at all. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
No. Because we should not repeat the mistakes of past. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Absolutely. We should make new mistakes. 
 
 
 
32 
Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
No. See, small company cannot afford to make mistakes. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
I am joking. Hey. Relax. I'm joking. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
Because, obviously, we have invested in the company for last 17 years and return is zero. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Please rest assured. We have a very strong fiscal discipline, and I can tell you that this bottom line has 
not come by itself. Right? 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
That I'm seeing that. That's why I'm not asking question on those areas in this conference. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
No, that's what I'm saying. So, there is a structure d process that we have been following. Every 
business must meet internal metric for us. It's a n o-go gate for us. I am happy to kill a product that 's 
very advanced also if it does not meet my gate. So,  we are very rigorous about that, actually. I don't  
think that you need to be worried about that aspect, I can assure you, that we will not do that again. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
And on the Investor Day, if it is possible, try to schedule it on weekend. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Okay . Let's see what we can do. Because I have to take multiple parties and I have to take many people 
along here. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
Yeah. Because what happens then it becomes easy to attend. Otherwise, we have to leave our job and 
come for one day there. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
But, Mahesh, this is your own company. So, you must come. 
 
Mahesh Kumar 
 
No. I am also responsible in my company also.

Moderator 
 
Thank you. The last question comes from Jitendra Bhutoria, an individual investor. Please go ahead. 
 
Jitendra Bhutoria 
 
Thank you for the opportunity. I was just hearing this call, and maybe you had mentioned some legacy 
issues. Can you spell out the legacy issues which you feel could come out maybe? Secondly, there's a 
goodwill of INR 196 crore on the balance sheet. Can  we have a split of which businesses  this 
stipulates? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Sorry. 
 
Sumit Kumar 
 
So, INR 196 crore, which you're talking about, it's  a goodwill. Correct? Because we barely hear you 
correctly. Yes. So, the goodwill, that it's coming out from our main IP, which is the RAFM IP. So, that is 
there in the balance sheet. And as a yearly, we do impairment exercise around on that and see 
whether the carrying value is sufficient enough based on the future updates and the business around 
on that. So as a process is, again, you will appreciate it's a yearly process. It's typically audit process. 
 
And it goes as a mandatory impairment testing. If any impairment comes, we take a hit. If it's not, then 
obviously, it's continuous as that. And this quarte r also, we did report the balance sheet and this 
carrying value seems to be sufficient enough and that's how we did it. 
 
Jitendra Bhutoria 
 
Yes, of course, we are reporting the balance sheet. But the point is when you talk about legacy issues 
and you had spoken about noncash-related one-time c ould be possible. So, it has to be out of that 
goodwill only then. So, that is the reason I'm asking you what are the legacy issues which you can spell 
it out? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
Legacy issues are some of these things that we continue to carry on the balance sheet and all that. So, 
there are some structural issues. Again, these are things that happen on an annual basis. Like, was 
34 
Subex Limited  12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
saying, annual, we'll do the impairment exercise, and we will take a call at that point of time. So I just 
-- I feel that all the current ongoing businesses a nd cleanup that had to be done I actually think tha t 
it's behind us. 
 
But there are some legacy issues which continue with to kind of be with us, and we'll continue to take 
it as it comes. I mean, this is not something that they can actively work upon. There's nothing that I  
can actively do about it right now. Wherever we could actively do what needed, it has happened. 
 
Jitendra Bhutoria 
 
So, but again, if you become as a surprise? 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
I can't hear you very clearly, Jitendra. 
 
Jitendra Bhutoria 
 
What I'm trying to say is, again it might come as a surprise in one of the quarters. 
 
Nisha Dutt 
 
I would say that I mean all the investors have been looking at our P&L and balance sheet pretty closely. 
So, I think there should be no surprises anymore in  the sense that you are aware of the legacy issues 
that we carry. And we will do the impairment exercise. And if it has to be done, then we will take it. I 
mean, it's more procedural for me at this point of time. 
It's not a part that I can control, as you can appreciate. This is a legacy. This is not something that I'm 
actively working on that I can somehow control. So, it's a noncash item also, so it has to be dealt with 
in an appropriate manner. So, will it happen in the  upcoming quarters? That's why I said that if it is  
legacy and if there is some structural thing that has to be done, we'll take care of it. But you are aware 
that it is there. That matter remains on the balance sheet. 
 
Jitendra Bhutoria 
 
No. That's I appreciate. Thank you. 
 
Nisha Dutt

Thank you all for, again, joining us. I think overa ll, the guidance that I can give is that I think H1  has 
been fairly good. I think we ended Q2 on a good note in terms of order book and the profitability. We 
are looking to continue the momentum in H2. Typical ly, H2 ends up being a little -- if you have been 
with us, you will know that H2 ends up being slightly better than H1. 
 
So, we are hoping that we continue the momentum. Again, as in when we announce the Investor Day, 
I look forward to seeing most of you here. Please d o come. We will share the information on the 
products, on adjacencies, on new areas, on the TAM,  everything that you have been asking for, for a 
while. 
So, we'll share as much as we can. But in the meant ime, if you have any questions that we haven't 
been able to answer today, please write to us. You know how to reach us. Write to us, and we'll 
promptly get back to you. But thank you for your continued support and faith in the company. 
 
So, again look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Thank you.
