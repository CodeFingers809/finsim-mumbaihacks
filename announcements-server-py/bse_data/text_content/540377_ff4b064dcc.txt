Limited review report 
Review report to: 
The Board of Directors 
IFL ENTERPRISES LIMITED 
We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited standalone financial 
results of IFL ENTERPRISES LIMITED (hereinafter referred to as the “Company™) 
for the quarter ended 30" September, 2025 (the "Statement") attached herewith, 
being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requircments of Regulation 33 of 
the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, 
read with SEBI Circular No. CIR/CFD/CMD1/80/2019 dated 19 July, 2019. 
This statement is the responsibility of the Company's management and has been approved by the Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to issue a report on these standalone financial statements based on our review. 
We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagement (SRE) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information performed by the independent auditor of the Entity" issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the financial statements are free of material misstatements. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus provide less assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
Basis for disclaimer of opinion: 
As informed by the Director and various points pertaining to various elements of the financial statements as mentioned below may require necessary adjustments / disclosures in financial statements and may have material and pervasive impact on the financial position of the Company for the quarter ended as at 30" September, 2025. The books of account of the company have been prepared on going concern basis. Accordingly, pending following adjustments and unavailability of sufficient and appropriate audit evidence, we are unable to express our opinion on the attached standalone financial statements of the Company. 
[§) 
. During the time of our audit, we have not been provided with satisfactory 
supporting documents for completeness of transactions pertaining to sales, 
purchase, valuation of inventory, third party balance confirmation of trade 
receivables and payable alongwith related tax compliances thereof 
outstanding as on 30th September, 2025 in the financial results of the 
Standalone. Therefore, we could not generate and obtain appropriate audit 
evidences for the aforesaid observations. 
. During the time of audit, we have not been provided with fixed assets 
register of Standalone Companies. Due to lack of documents and 
supporting documents, we could not ascertain the genuineness of 
depreciation and deferred tax liabilities/assets. 
. The Standalone Companies having unsecured loans for which management 
has not charged interest, and relevant loan agreements are not available. 
While a portion of these balances has been verified through cross-ledger 
verification, confirmations for the remaining balances have not been 
obtained. In the absence of valid agreements and necessary confirmations, 
the accuracy of the balances and their interest-free status could not be fully 
verified, which may impact the fair presentation of liabilities and interest 
expenses. 
. The Company has significant trade payables; however, the bifurcation 
between Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) creditors has not 
been provided. Non-disclosure of the MSME classification is not in 
compliance with the provisions of the Micro, Small and Medium 
Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006, thereby affecting both 
regulatory compliance and financial transparency. Further, advances paid 
to suppliers remain unconfirmed.In the absence of confirmations from 
these parties raises concems regarding the reliability and completeness of 
liabilities reported in the financial statements. 
. Trade receivables outstanding as at the reporting date have not been 
confirmed by the respective debtors. In the absence of direct external 
confirmations or sufficient alternative audit procedures, we are unahle to 
verify the accuracy, completeness, or recoverability of these balances. 
. The Standalone Companies have granted loans for which confirmations 
and supporting loan agreements were not made available for verification. 
In the absence of such information, the accuracy, recoverability, and 
interest-free nature of these loans could not be verified. Accordingly, we 
are unable to comment on the possible impact, if any, on the fair 
presentation of the company’s financial statements with respect Lo assets, 
liabilities, and interest income. 
Based on our review conducted as above, apart from the aforesaid observations, 
nothing has come to our attention, apart from the matters reported under Basis for 
Disclaimer of opinion that causes us to believe that the accompanying statement of 
unaudited Consolidated financial results prepared in accordance with applicable 
accounting standards and other recognized accounting practices and policies has not 
disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the 
SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 read 
with SEBI Circular No. CIR/CFD/CMD1/80/2019 dated 19% July, 2019, including 
the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material 
misstatement. 
We have not reviewed the accompanying Consolidated financial results and other 
financial information for the quarter cnded 30 Scptember, 2024 which has been 
presented solely based on the information compiled by the Management and has 
been approved by the Board of Directors.

Limited review report 
Review report to: 
The Board of Directors 
IFL ENTERPRISES LIMITED 
We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited Consolidated financial 
results of IFL ENTERPRISES LIMITED (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”) 
for the quarter ended 30™ September, 2025 (the "Statement") attached herewith, 
being submitted by the Holding Company pursuant to the requirements of 
Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, read with SEBI Circular No. CIR/CFD/CMDI/80/2019 dated 19% 
July, 2019. 
This statement is the responsibility of the Company's management and has been 
approved by the Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to issue a report on these 
Consolidated financial statements based on our review. 
We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on 
Review Engagement (SRE) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information 
performed by the independent auditor of the Entity" issued by the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform the 
review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatements. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of company 
personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus provide less 
assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion. 
Basis for disclaimer of opinion: 
As informed by the Director and various points pertaining to various elements of the 
financial statements as mentioned below may require necessary adjustments / 
disclosurcs in financial statements and may have material and pervasive impact on 
the financial position of the Company for the quarter ended as at 30" Scptember, 
2025. The books of account of the company have been prepared on going concern 
basis. Accordingly, pending following adjustments and unavallablllty of suffigi 
and appropriate audit evidence, we are unable to express our opinion on th 
Consolidated financial statements of the Company. 
. During the time of our audit, we have not been provided with satisfactory 
supporting documents for completeness of transactions pertaining to sales, 
purchase, valuation of inventory, third party balance confirmation of trade 
receivables and payable alongwith related tax compliances thereof 
outstanding as on 30th September, 2025 in the financial results. Therefore, we 
could not generate and obtain appropriate audit evidences for the aforesaid 
observations. 
. During the time of audit, we have not been provided with fixed assets register. 
Due to lack of documents and supporting documents, we could not ascertain 
the genuineness of depreciation and deferred tax liabilities/assets. 
. The company has unsecured loans for which management has not charged 
interest, and relevant loan agreements are not available. While a portion of 
these balances has been verified through cross-ledger verification, 
confirmations for the remaining balances have not been obtained. In the 
absence of valid agreements and necessary confirmations, the accuracy of the 
balances and their interest-free status could not be fully verified, which may 
impact the fair presentation of liabilities and interest expenses. 
. The Company has significant trade payables; however, the bifurcation 
between Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) creditors has not 
been provided. Non-disclosure of the MSME classification is not in 
compliance with the provisions of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises 
Development (MSMED) Act, 2006, thereby affecting both regulatory 
compliance and financial transparency. Further, advances paid to suppliers 
remain unconfirmed.In the absence of confirmations from these parties raises 
concerns regarding the reliability and completeness of liabilities reported in 
the financial statements. 
. Trade receivables outstanding as at the reporting date have not been 
confirmed by the respective debtors. In the absence of direct external 
confirmations or sufficient alternative audit procedures, we are unable to 
verify the accuracy, completeness, or recoverability of these balances. 
. The company has granted loans for which confirmations and supporting loan 
agreements were not made available for verification. In the absence of such 
information, the accuracy, recoverability, and interest-free nature of these 
loans could not be verified. Accordingly, we are unable to comment on the 
possible impact, if any, on the fair presentation of the company’s financial 
statements with respect to assets, liabilities, and interest income. 
Based on our review conducted as above, apart from the aforesaid observations, 
nothing has come to our attention, apart from the matters reported under Basis for 
Disclaimer of opinion that causes us to believe that the accompanying statement of 
unaudited standalone financial results prepared in accordance with applicable 
accounting standards and other recognized accounting practices and policies has not 
disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the 
SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 read 
with SEBI Circular No. CIR/CFD/CMD1/80/2019 dated 19 July, 2019, including 
the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material 
misstatement. 
We have not reviewed the accompanying standalone financial results and other 
financial information for the quarter ended 30" September, 2024 which has been 
presented solely based on the information compiled by the Management and has 
been approved by the Board of Directors.
