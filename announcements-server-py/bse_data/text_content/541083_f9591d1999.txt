Commenting on the 
performance 
Mr. Amit Kaushik, 
CEO
I am happy to share that after continuous efforts over the last 2-3 years where we faced several 
challenges and hardships, true to our grit and determination at Inflame, we have delivered a strong 
performance on all fronts including Revenue, EBITDA and Net Profit. This is also our highest and best 
performance ever for a half year period
Our Revenue at Rs 76.3 cr grew at 43.5% YoY while EBITDA at Rs 9 crore grew at 64.5% YoY. Net 
Profit also grew sharply at 333% YoY to Rs 3.5 cr. This performance has been aided by strong 
volumes at both Panchkula and Hyderabad during the first half.
Our highest selling product Chimney volumes grew at 27% YoY, with the exit rate at Hyderabad and 
Panchkula collectively standing at 30,000 units per month.
Our growing premiumisation has also led to our average realisation in chimneys moving up gradually. 
We have been closely working with our customers to offer them complete end-to-end solutions and 
quality products.
Inflame continues to be the largest OEM/ODM manufacturer of kitchen appliances (especially 
Chimneys) in India, working with major brands. It has created a strong alternative to imports, thereby 
being a key part of the Government’s ‘Make in India’ initiative.
We maintain our 40–50% revenue guidance for FY26 and FY27.

MARKET DRIVERS
33INVESTOR PRESENTATION 
Consumer 
Awareness
The growing popularity of premium 
kitchen appliances on account of 
rising consumer awareness about high 
quality and durability represents one 
of the key factors positively 
influencing the market in India. 
Low 
Logistics Cost
Businesses today are hugely affected 
due to high logistics cost, badly 
delayed shipments & commodity price 
hikes, manufacturing in India is way 
viable than imports. 
Low
Penetration
The present penetration for this 
product is very less & thus scope for 
growth is tremendous. Urban 
customers are now considering 
appliances as lifestyle products and 
are open to pay increased prices for 
products that are ergonomically 
designed and offer multiple features. 
Reduce Import
Dependence
Positive trends in demographics have 
further helped to enhance growth. 
Factors such as the increasing 
number of nuclear families have led 
to a rise in the volumes of appliances 
sold.
Technology
Advancement
Innovations such as auto-clean 
features, noise reduction, and smart 
connectivity are attracting consumers 
towards advanced kitchen chimney 
models.

YOU!
