Independent Auditor's Review Report on Standalone Unaudited Quarterly Financial Results and 
Year to Date Results of the Company pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) 
To, 
The Board of Directors, 
Diffusion Engineers Limited 
Nagpur. 
We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Unaudited Standalone Financial Results 
of Diffusion Engineers Limited (“the Company”), for the quarter ended 30th September, 
2025 and year to date results for the period 1st April 2025 to 30th September, 2025 (“the 
Statement"), being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 
33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as 
amended. 
This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company’s Management and approved by 
the Company’s Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition 
and measurement principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standard 34 “Interim 
Financial Reporting” (“Ind AS 34"), prescribed under Section 133 the Companies Act, 2013 
read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on 
our review. 
We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 ‘Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity’, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
(ICA1). A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of 
the Company’s personnel responsible for financial and accounting matters and applying 
analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit 
conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the 
Companies Act, 2013 and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we 
would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. 
Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
Based on our review conducted as stated in paragraph 3 above, nothing has come to our 
attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in 
accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid 
Indian Accounting Standard and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has 
not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended, including 
the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
