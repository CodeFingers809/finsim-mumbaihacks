Independent Auditor’s Review Report on Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results 
of the Company pursuant to the Requlation 33of the 
SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Requlations, 2015, as amended. 
for the Quarter and Half Year ended 30 September, 2025 
To 
The Board of Directors of CP Capital Limited (erstwhile Career Point Limited), 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Unaudited Consolidated Financial 
Results (the ‘Statement’) of CP Capital Limited (the ‘Parent’) and its Subsidiary (the Parent 
and its Subsidiary, together referred to as ‘the Group') and its share of the net profit/ loss after 
tax and total comprehensive income/ loss of its associate for the quarter and half year ended 
30 September, 2025, being submitted by the Parent pursuant to the requirements of the 
Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015, as amended (‘the Listing Regulations’). 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Parent's Management and approved by the 
Parent's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principies laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial 
Reporting” (“Ind AS 34"), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and 
other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to express a 
conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons 
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review 
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance 
with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we 
would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, 
we do not express an audit opinion. 
We also performed procedures in accordance with the circular issued by the SEBI under 
Regulation 33 (8) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015, as amended, to the extent applicable. 
4. The Statement include the financial results of the following entities: 
Name of Entity Nature of relationship 
CP Capital Limited (CPCL) Parent Company 
Career Point Infra Limited (CPIL) 
(including its Subsidiaries ie. Coupler Enterprises Wholly Owned Subsidiary 
Private Limited and Srajan Agritech Private Limited) 
Imperial Infin Private Limited (IIPL) Associate 
Conclusion 
Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above 
and based on the consideration of the review reports of the other auditor referred to in 
paragraph 6.iii below, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 
accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement 
principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standard and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be 
disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended, including the manner in which it is to be 
disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement. 
Other Matters 
We did not review the interim financial results of one Wholly Owned Subsidiary, whose 
interim financial results reflect total assets of Rs. 15,527.21 lakhs as at 30 September, 
2025, total revenues of Rs. 303.23 lakhs and Rs. 742.96 lakhs, net profit after tax of Rs. 
195.18 lakhs and Rs. 484.87 lakhs, total comprehensive income of Rs. 195.18 lakhs and 
Rs. 484.87 lakhs for the quarter and half year ended 30 September, 2025 respectively 
and cash inflow of Rs. 10.94 lakhs for the half year ended 30 September, 2025 as 
considered in the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results. These interim financial 
results have been reviewed by other auditor whose report have been furnished to us by 
the Parent Company’s Management and our Conclusion and Other Matters, on the 
Statement, in so far as it relate to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of the 
said Subsidiary, is based on the report of the said other auditor, and after consideration of 
the further facts and information provided to us by the Parent Company’s management, at 
the time of consolidation of these financial results, and the procedures performed by us as 
stated in paragraph 3 above. 
We did not review the interim financial results of one associate, whose unaudited interim 
financial results / financial information reflect Group's share of profit after tax of Rs. 1.46 
lakhs and Rs. 2.85 lakhs and total comprehensive loss of Rs. 0.27 lakhs and Rs. 19.98 
lakhs for the quarter and half year ended 30 September, 2025 respectively, as considered 
in the Statement which have been reviewed by the other auditor. 
ii. We draw attention to the fact that the corresponding figures for the quarter and half year 
ended 30 September, 2024 are based on the financial results which were audited by the 
predecessor auditor M/s. Lodha & Co LLP, who had expressed unmodified conclusions 
thereon vide their limited review reports dated 11 November, 2024, after restatement in 
accordance with the Composite Scheme of Arrangement as mentioned in in note 3 to the 
Statement. 
Our conclusion on the Statement is not modified in respect of above matters.

Independent Auditor’s Review Report on Unaudited Standalone Financial Results 
of the Company pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the 
SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended 
for the Quarter and Half Year ended 30 September, 2025 
To 
The Board of Directors of CP Capital Limited (erstwhile Career Point Limited), 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Unaudited Standalone Financial 
Results (the ‘Statement’) of CP Capital Limited (the ‘Company') for the quarter and half year 
ended 30 September, 2025. This statement is the responsibility of the Company's 
Management and has been approved by the Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to issue 
a report on these unaudited standalone financial results based on our review. 
2. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as 
to whether the Statement is free of material misstatement. A review is limited primarily to 
inquiries of Company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus 
provides less assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we 
do not express an audit opinion. 
3. Conclusion: 
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us 
to believe that the accompanying Statement of Unaudited Standalone Financial Results 
prepared in accordance with applicable Indian Accounting Standards and other recognized 
accounting practices and policies has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed 
in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, as amended, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it 
contains any material misstatement. 
4. Other Matter: 
We draw attention to the fact that the corresponding figures for the quarter and half year 
ended 30 September, 2024 are based on the financial results which were audited by the 
predecessor auditor M/s. Lodha & Co LLP, who had expressed unmodified conclusions 
thereon vide their limited review report dated 11 November, 2024, after restatement in 
accordance with the Composite Scheme of Arrangement as mentioned in note 3 to the 
Statement. 
Our conclusion is not modified in respect of above matter.
