Dear Sir/Madam, 
 
Sub:  Intimation under Regulation 30 read with Schedule III of SEBI (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 - Acquisition of stake of Mahindra – BT 
Investment Company (Mauritius) Limited (“MBTICM”) by the Company 
 
In continuation of the Group’s initiative to simplify its structure, we have concluded the transaction outlined 
below. This transaction involves conclusion of a venture by purchasing shares in MBTICM for a consideration 
of Rs. 66.33 crores, which reflects the fair value of available assets of the company. It will enable the 
Company to pursue liquidation of MBTICM. 
 
Further, we refer to our earlier communication dated 18th March 2025, wherein we had intimated that the 
Company has completed the execution of a Share Purchase Agreement with Mahindra Overseas Investment 
Company (Mauritius) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“MOICML”) and MBTICM, a 
subsidiary of MOICML whereby the Company had agreed to acquire 67,71,600 Equity Shares of MBTICM 
constituting 57% of its Paid-Up Equity Share Capital from MOICML.  
 
In this connection, the Company has today at 7:42 p.m. completed the execution of a Share Purchase 
Agreement with BT Holdings Limited (“BTHL”) and MBTICM whereby the Company has agreed to acquire 
51,08,400 Equity Shares of MBTICM constituting 43% of its Paid -Up Equity Share Capital from BTHL for a 
consideration of Rs. 66.33 crores in proportion to the available assets of the company.  This acquisition of 
shares will enable both parties to conclude this venture which is no longer aligned with the strategic priorities 
of either company. Upon completion of the said transaction, BTHL’s shareholding in MBTICM would become 
NIL and the Company would hold 100% of the Paid-Up Equity Share Capital of MBTICM. Consequently, 
MBTICM would become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 
 
The details as required under SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 
read with SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated 11 th November 2024  (as 
amended), are given in Annexure A to this letter. 
 
Yours sincerely, 
For MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA LIMITED
