Limited Review Report on Unaudited Quarterly and Year•to•date Ftnanctal Results of Spice Islands Industries Limited under Regulation 33 of the SEBI • (Listing Oblisatlons and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended. 
To, 
The Board of Directors 
SPICE ISLANDS INDUSTRIES LIMITED 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results of SPICE ISLANDS INDUSTRIES LIMITED ('the Company') for the quarter and half year· ended J0th September 2025. The statement is being submitted by the company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations a~ Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended ("Listing Regulations"). 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's management and approved by the Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" ("Ind AS 34"), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. Our responsibility is to issue a report on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity", issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express ~n audit opinion.

4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance witti applicable accounting standards and other recognised accounting practices and policies has not disclosed the information requf red to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
