“ “
In Q2 FY26, we delivered healthy sequential growth, supported by stable demand and improved
operational efficiency. Gross profit strengthened sharply, with gross margins expanding by nearly 500
BPS QoQ to 38.45%, driven by better cost management and an improved product mix. This translated
into a strong operating performance, with EBITDA rising 23% QoQ and margins improving to 22.53%.
PBT increased by 12.4% on a QoQ basis, while PAT also recorded a steady 4% sequential growth,
reflecting the resilience of our earnings profile.
We are seeing sustained traction in our key end user sectors, particularly FMCG and Oil and Gas,
which continue to support consistent volume momentum. The textile segment is also navigating the
evolving US tariff environment, and we continue to engage closely with customers to support steady
demand.
Going forward, we remain focused on maintaining these enhanced margin levels through disciplined
cost controls, deeper customer engagement and ongoing process improvements across our
operations. With strong demand cues, an expanding international footprint, a diverse portfolio and a
stable balance sheet, we are well placed to execute our strategy and continue delivering long-term
value to stakeholders.
