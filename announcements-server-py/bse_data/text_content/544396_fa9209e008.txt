Subject: Intimation under Regulation 30 read with Para C of Part A of Schedule III of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 – Partnership with Cosmos Co-operative Bank Ltd for Expansion of Digital 
Payment Acceptance Infrastructure 
 
Respected Sir/Madam, 
 
Pursuant to Regulation 30 read with Para C of Part A of Schedule III of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015, we wish to inform you that Network People Services Technologies Limited (NPST) has 
entered into a partnership with Cosmos Co-operative Bank Ltd to expand digital payment acceptance infrastructure for 
co-operative banks across India. 
 
As part of this partnership, NPST will be leveraging its offline payment acceptance platform - Qynx, to manage the 
complete merchant lifecycle, including: 
 Device procurement and logistics 
 Merchant onboarding for acquirers 
 Field operations and servicing 
 Technical integration 
 Compliance and regulatory management 
 
This collaboration will enable more than 1,500 co-operative banks, collectively operating over 11,000 branches, to offer 
QR code and soundbox-based digital payment acceptance to their customers without the need to develop or maintain 
their own digital backend infrastructure. 
 
The initiative is expected to significantly contribute to financial inclusion and support the adoption of digital payments 
across semi-urban and rural markets. 
 
Kindly take the aforesaid on your records. 
  
Thanking You, 
Yours Faithfully, 
For Network People Services Technologies Limited 
 
 
 
Chetna Chawla 
Company Secretary and Compliance Officer
