Limited Review Report 
Review report to The Board of Directors of NB Footwear Limited 
We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results of 
NB Footwear Limited (“the Company”) for the quarter and six months ended 30% 
September 2025. This statement is the responsibility of the Company’s Management and has 
been approved by the Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to issue a report on these 
financial statements based on our review. 
We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as 
to whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. A review is limited 
primarily to inquiries of company personnel and an analytical procedure applied to financial 
data and thus provides less assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and 
accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results prepared in accordance 
with applicable India accounting standards (“Ind As”) and other recognized accounting 
practices and policies has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of 
Regulation 33 of the SEBI(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 
including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material 
misstatement.
