PRESS RELEASE 
 
 
Mumbai, November 20, 2025 
 
Godrej Properties adds INR 2,400 crore additional revenue potential to its 
recent acquisition on Sarjapur Road, Bengaluru 
 This takes the total project revenue potential to INR 3,500 crore*  
Godrej Properties Limited (GPL) (BSE: GODREJPRP), one of India’s leading real estate developers, 
today announced the acquisition of an additional ~ 3.8-acre land parcel in South Bengaluru, thereby 
unlocking INR 2,400 crore of additional revenue and ~ 2 million sq. ft. of additional development 
potential. With this acquisition, GPL envisions a large-scale, premium residential community with an 
estimated total revenue potential of ~ INR 3,500 crore with ~ 3 million sq. ft. on the overall ~ 30 acres 
development. The enhanced potential is largely due to higher FSI permissibility across the entire land 
parcel, allowing the combined ~ 30 acres holding to be master planned as an integrated group housing 
development township. 
This land parcel offers GPL the scale to conceptualize a thoughtfully planned township community with 
ample open spaces, lifestyle amenities, and a diverse residential offering that blends sustainability, 
wellness, and modern conveniences. 
This acquisition also strengthens GPL’s presence in the Sarjapur Road micro-market, one of 
Bengaluru’s most vibrant residential hubs. The area’s appeal lies in its seamless connectivity to major 
employment centers such as Outer Ring Road, Whitefield, Bellandur, and Electronic City, 
complemented by a mature social ecosystem of reputed schools, hospitals, retail avenues, and 
workspaces. These factors make Sarjapur Road a preferred destination for homebuyers seeking well-
connected, high-quality urban living. 
Commenting on the acquisition, Gaurav Pandey, MD & CEO, Godrej Properties, said, “This expansion 
gives us the opportunity to create a landmark community that reflects our vision for sustainable, 
integrated living. The strong performance of our projects in this corridor highlights the depth of demand 
and the confidence customers place in our brand. We will aim to deliver a development that not only 
meets the aspirations of today’s homebuyers but also sets new standards for design, wellness, and 
urban planning in Bengaluru.”
