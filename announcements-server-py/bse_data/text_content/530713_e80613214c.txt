Limited Review Report on Unaudited Standalone Financial Results  
for the quarter ended on 30 September 2025 and  
year to date from 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025 
 
To 
The Board of Directors,  
AJEL Limited,  
106, 2nd Floor,  
Mahada Shopping Complex,  
New Link Road, Jogeshwari,  
Mumbai - 400102. 
 
We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Unaudited Standalone Financial Results of AJEL 
Limited (‘the Company’) for the period ended 30 September 2025 and year to date from 1 April  
2025 to 30 September 2025  (‘Statement’) attached herewith, being submitted by the Company 
pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 52 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 as amended from time to time (“Listing Regulations”) . Our 
responsibility is merely restricted to review the financial figures in the said and issue a report in 
this regard where no in-depth audit procedures have been performed.  
 
This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and approved by the 
Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement 
principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financia l Reporting" (Ind AS 
34), prescribed ·Under section. 133 of the Companies ’ Act, 2013, as amended, read with relevant 
rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our 
responsibility is merely restricted to review the financial figures in the said and issue a report in 
this regard where no in-depth audit procedures have been performed. 
 
We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410, ‘Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent 
Auditors of the Entity’ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). A review of 
interim consolidated financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of Company’s 
personnel responsible for financial and accounting matters and applying analytical and other review 
procedures. A review is substantially  less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with 
Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would 
become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. We have not performed 
an aud it and accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion . Further, we have obtained the 
financial information pertaining to the operations of the branch in United States of America from 
the management of the Company for the said period under review and have not performed any 
audit procedures on the same prior to considering them in the review of Standalone Financial results 
for the said period ended on 30 September 2025. 
 
However, we draw attention to the below-mentioned  
a) Amounts directly attributable to project expenses during the financial year ended 31.03.2024 
have been considered as an Intangible Asset under development owing to the Memorandum of 
Understanding entered into between the Company and Transcord Telscape Private Limited dated 
15.10.2022. 

Page 2 of 2 
 
 
 
b) The Company has availed a Cash Credit facility amounting to INR 5,00,00,000 (Five Crore 
Rupees only) from Bank of Maharashtra, Hyderabad for the purpose of servicing the expenses 
pertaining to the ongoing project activities out of which INR 3,00,00,000 (Th ree Crore Rupees 
only) has been advanced to Transcord Telscape Private Limited towards advance for services.  
c) The company during year 2023-24 has availed a loan amounting to Rs.5 crore (Rs.1 crore being 
for working capital under MSME categorization and Rs.4 crore being loan repayable on demand 
from Bank of Maharashtra,  wherein, the said loan facility,  during the year 2024 -25, owing to  
non-repayment of interest and principal  the loan account has been declared as a Non-
performing Asset (‘NPA’) on 08th October 2024, the status of which still remains the same.  
d) We were not provided with requisite details , as to confirm the balance of Trade payables  and 
loans & advances (Receivables) of the Company standing as on 30 September 2025. In absence 
of such information, we were not able to comment upon the reasonableness of Trade Payables  
and Receivables balance s as at that date and its possible impact, if any, on the financial 
statements. 
e) The Company has financed Rs. 85,96,143 disclosed under the head “Other Long Term Loans & 
Advances” in the financial statements, which are yet to be recovered. In the absence of 
management’s information regarding the status of recovery and the possible recover ableness, 
we are unable to opine on the same and its impact on the overall financial stabilit y of the 
Company. 
f) During the year, the company held investments in listed equity shares worth INR 105.01 Lakhs  
in respect of which, we were unable to verify the physical share certificates nor shares in de -
materialized form for majority of the shares held as investments. 
g) The investments have not been measured at fair value at the end of the quarter ended 30 
September 2025, which will be done at the end of the year; Depreciation has not been calculated 
for the quarter ended 30 September 2025. 
h) The company has not paid  any tax and  other regulatory statutory dues including those of 
employees up to the quarter ended September 30th, 2025.  In absence of management 
confirmation regarding its payment status we are unable to comment upon the current status 
of the same. 
 
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Ind AS and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulations 
33 and 52 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as 
amended, including the manner in whi ch it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material 
misstatement.

Limited Review Report on Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results  
for the quarter ended on 30 September 2025 and  
year to date from 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025 
 
 
To 
The Board of Directors,  
AJEL Limited,  
106, 2nd Floor,  
Mahada Shopping Complex,  
New Link Road, Jogeshwari,  
Mumbai - 400102. 
 
We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results of 
AJEL Limited (‘the Company’) including its subsidiary entity, together referred to as ‘AJEL Group’, 
for the period ended 30 September 2025 and year to date from 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025 
(‘Consolidated Statement’) attached herewith, being submitted by the Company pursuant to the 
requirements of Regulation 52 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015 as amended from time to time (“Listing Regulations”) . Our responsibility is 
merely restricted to review the financial figures in the said and issue a report in this regard where 
no in-depth audit procedures have been performed.  
 
This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and approved by the 
Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement 
principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financia l Reporting" (Ind AS 
34), prescribed ·Under section. 133 of the Companies ’ Act, 2013, as amended, read with relevant 
rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our 
responsibility is merely restricted to review the financial figures in the said and issue a report in 
this regard where no in-depth audit procedures have been performed. 
 
We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410, ‘Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent 
Auditors of the Entity’ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). A review of 
interim consolidated financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of Company’s 
personnel responsible for financial and accounting matters and applying analytical and other review 
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in ac cordance with 
Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would 
become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. We have not performed 
an audit and accordingly, we do not express an aud it opinion . Further, we have obtained the 
financial information pertaining to the operations in United States of America (related to Branch 
and Subsidiary) from the management of the Company for the said period under review and have 
not performed any audit procedures on the same prior to considering them in the review of the 
Consolidated Financial results for the said period ended on 30 September 2025.

However, we draw attention to the below-mentioned  
a) Amounts directly attributable to project expenses during the financial year ended 31.03.2024 
have been considered as an Intangible Asset under development owing to the Memorandum of 
Understanding entered into between the Company and Transcord Telscape Private Limited dated 
15.10.2022. 
 
b) The Company has availed a Cash Credit facility amounting to INR 5,00,00,000 (Five Crore 
Rupees only) from Bank of Maharashtra, Hyderabad for the purpose of servicing the expenses 
pertaining to the ongoing project activities out of which INR 3,00,00,000 (Th ree Crore Rupees 
only) has been advanced to Transcord Telscape Private Limited towards advance for services.  
 
c) The company during year 2023-24 has availed a loan amounting to Rs.5 crore (Rs.1 crore being 
for working capital under MSME categorization and Rs.4 crore being loan repayable on demand 
from Bank of Maharashtra,  wherein, the said loan facility,  during the year 2024 -25, owing to  
non-repayment of interest and principal  the loan account has been declared as a Non-
performing Asset (‘NPA’) on 08th October 2024, the status of which still remains the same.  
 
d) We were not provided with requisite details , as to confirm the balance of Trade payables  and 
loans & advances (Receivables) of the Company standing as on 30 September 2025. In absence 
of such information, we were not able to comment upon the reasonableness of Trade Payables  
and Receivables balance s as at that date and its possible impact, if any, on the financial 
statements. 
 
e) The Company has financed Rs. 85,96,143 disclosed under the head “Other Long Term Loans & 
Advances” in the financial statements, which are yet to be recovered. In the absence of 
management’s information regarding the status of recovery and the possible recover ableness, 
we are unable to opine on the same and its impact on the overall financial stabilit y of the 
Company. 
 
f) During the year, the company held investments in listed equity shares worth INR 105.01 Lakhs  
in respect of which, we were unable to verify the physical share certificates nor shares in de -
materialized form for majority of the shares held as investments. 
 
g) The investments have not been measured at fair value at the end of the quarter ended 30 
September 2025, which will be done at the end of the year; Depreciation has not been calculated 
for the quarter ended 30 September 2025. 
 
h) The company has not paid  any tax and  other regulatory statutory dues including those of 
employees up to the quarter ended September 30th, 2025.  In absence of management 
confirmation regarding its payment status we are unable to comment upon the current status 
of the same. 
 
The consolidated financial results include financial results of the Standalone Holding Company along 
with the financial results of the following: 
1. Ajel Technologies India Private Limited (Subsidiary Company) 
2. Ajel Technologies, Inc (Subsidiary of Subsidiary Company)

Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Ind AS and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulations 
33 and 52 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as 
amended, including the manner in whi ch it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material 
misstatement.
