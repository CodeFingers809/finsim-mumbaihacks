In 2024, the OOH industry composition stood at 
approximately 60% Traditional OOH, 28% Transit OOH, 
and 12% Digital OOH (DOOH).
By 2027, the share is projected to evolve to about 51% 
Traditional OOH, 32% Transit OOH, and 17% Digital 
OOH (DOOH) — underscoring the accelerating digital 
and transit-led transformation of India’s OOH sector.
Source: FICCI-EY Media & Entertainment Industry Report
• India’s OOH segment reached an all-time high of ₹59.2 billion in 2024, driven by its ability to deliver premium, high-impact visibility for brands 
• Growth was supported by urbanization, rising transit infrastructure (metros, airports, highways) and expansion of digital OOH inventory.
• Key spending categories: Real estate, FMCG, Retail, Consumer services, and Election advertising.
• Growth will be driven by premiumization of assets, transit media expansion, and integration with digital ad networks.
• Implementation of standardized metrics like Roadstar is expected to enhance accountability and attract higher ad spends

Management Commentary
Mr. Shripad Ashtekar, 
Managing Director
“The first half of FY26 has been a defining phase for Signpost — a period where we have reimagined our 
approach, scaled new horizons and forged strategic partnerships that will drive the next leg of our growth. 
During this period, we have also focused on strengthening our internal competencies by inducting new 
talent across key functions, building a stronger foundation for the future.
Revenue for Q2FY26 stood at ₹134.0 crore. EBITDA for the quarter came in at ₹34.4 crore, with EBITDA 
margin at 25.7%. PAT stood at ₹15.7 crore, broadly stable on a year-on-year basis. Operationally for 
H1FY26, we have sustained the strong momentum built over the past year. For the first half of FY26, 
revenue grew by 18% year-on-year to ₹271.7 crore, driven by healthy traction from both private and PSU 
clients, coupled with improved network utilization and steady asset monetization. EBITDA for H1FY26 was 
up 14% to ₹66.2 crore and PAT higher by 14% at ₹30.9 crore, demonstrating consistent improvement in 
scale and profitability.
A major milestone of the quarter was securing the exclusive 9-year Bengaluru Metro contract, covering 67 
stations and over 100,000 sq ft of premium media inventory, with revenue potential of up to ₹700 crore 
over the contract period. This reinforces our position as a commuter-centric, infrastructure-led media 
player with a proven ability to deliver large-scale transit projects.
Strategically, we continued to expand our footprint across newer geographies to reduce concentration 
risks and build a more balanced, pan-India network. Our objective remains to position Signpost as a 
company that stands at the intersection of commuter convenience and infrastructure-led solutions — one 
that combines long-term visibility with new-age thinking and technology-driven execution.
As we move ahead, the focus will remain on sustainable and profitable growth, deepening our presence 
across key markets and driving innovation in the Out-of-Home and Digital OOH domains. We are confident 
that the strategic initiatives and partnerships undertaken this year will translate into stronger performance 
and value creation in the coming quarters.”
