GROWTH 
DRIVERS
Strong Domestic 
Demand:
• India’s appliance market is expanding 
rapidly, with AC and refrigeration 
demand projected to double in the 
next 5 to 7 years.
• Rising incomes, urbanisation and 
premiumisation continue to fuel 
sustained, long-term demand.
• VOEPL’s multi-location capacity 
positions it well to capture this growth 
across categories.
Policy Push for 
Localization:
• Government incentives (PLI, state 
subsidies, customs duty structure, FDI 
policies) are accelerating local 
manufacturing and component 
localisation.
• This directly supports VOEPL’s strategy 
of deep backward integration and 
multi-category expansion.
• “India for India + India for Global” is 
gaining strong momentum, opening 
new opportunities with global OEMs.
Strong Blue-Chip 
Customer Base:
• VOEPL’s growth is driven by leading 
brands with strong market share, 
stable demand visibility and consistent 
YoY growth.
• These customers provide early insight 
into market trends and new product 
needs, strengthening VOEPL’s 
planning and execution.
• This portfolio places VOEPL as a 
preferred long-term partner for new 
categories and higher value-add 
initiatives.. 
Supportive Central & 
State Incentives:
• Approval under the PLI Scheme for 
White Goods (100 Cr) strengthens 
VOEPL’s backward integration 
roadmap.
• Additional benefits under the 
Maharashtra Electronics Policy 
enhance viability of new investments 
and accelerate scale-up.
• Together, these incentives improve 
margins, reduce payback periods, and 
enhance competitiveness.
