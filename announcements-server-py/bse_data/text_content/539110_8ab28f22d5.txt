as a whole are free from rnaierial rnisstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue
an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 'n accordance with SAS will
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably
be expected lo influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
financial statements.

maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

whether due to fraud or error. design and perform audit procedures responsive to those
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate lo provide a basis for
our opinion, The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,
Intentional omissions. misrepresentations. or the override of internal control,
. Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section
143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the
Company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating
effectiveness of' such controls.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and :elated disclosures made by the management.
Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of
accounting and. based on the audi! evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty
exists related to events or conditions that may cas! significant doubt on the Company's
ability to continue ss a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists,
we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the
financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors'
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to

including the disclosures. and whether the financial statements represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Materialliy is the magnitude of misstatements in the financial statements that,
individually or in aggregate. makes it probable that the economic decisions of a
reasonably knowledgeable user of the financial statements may be influenced. We
consider quantitative rnateriaflty and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our
Audi! work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any
identied misstatements in the Enanclel statements.
11.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the eudit and significant audit iindings, including any signtticant
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
12.We also provide those charged with govemanoe with a statement that we have complied
with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them
all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
13.From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those
matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current
period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors'
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in
extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in
our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected
to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
