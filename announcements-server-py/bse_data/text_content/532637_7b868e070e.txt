had a substantial impact on our operations. Currently, only the Global Fund 
continues to provide support, and that too with a reduced budget. As a result, the 
slowdown in funding has led to a sharp decline in treatment-related orders. In 
light of the above, we are in active discussions with our lenders regarding a 
restructuring plan. As an MSME, and with the government’s recent focus on 
supporting the MSME sector through various relief packages, we are confident 
that we will be able to successfully navigate this challenging period.

SEBI/HO/DDHS/P/CIR/2021/613 dated 10" August 2021 as amended. 
The Board of Directors, 
Mangalam Drugs and Organics Limited, 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results of Mangalam 
Drugs and Organics Limited (the "Company") for the quarter and half year ended 
September 30, 2025 (the "Statement”) attached herewith. being submitted by the Company. 
pursuant to the requirements of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, as amended (the "Listing Regulations"). 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and approved by 
the Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition 
and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, (Ind AS 34) 
"Interim Financial Reporting” prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act. 2013 as 
amended. and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance 
with Regulation 33 and Regulation 52(4) read with regulation 63 of the SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended as prescribed in 
Securities and Exchange Board of India operational circular 
SEBI/HO/DDHS/P/CIR/2021/613 dated August 10, 2021. Our responsibility is to express a 
conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as 
to whether the Statement is free of material misstatement. A review of interim financial 
V. S. Somani & Co. 
Chartered Accountants 
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and 
accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing 
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all 
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an 
audit opinion. 
Basis for Modified Conclusion 
4. We draw attention to Note 6 of the accompanying Statement. which states that the 
Company has recognized Deferred Tax Assets (“DTA”) on tax losses for the quarter and 
half year ended 30 September 2025 based on the projections of probable future taxable 
profit prepared by the management which will be subject o audit. 
Modified Conclusion 
5. Based on our review conducted as stated in paragraph 4 above, except for the possible 
effects of the matter described in the “Basis for Modified Conclusion™ paragraph. nothing 
has come 1o our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement of 
Unaudited Financial Results, prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in the applicable Indian Accounting Standards (“Ind 
AS”) specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, read with relevant rules 
issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. has not 
disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of the Listing Regulations. 
including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material 
misstatement.

3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity", issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily 
of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and 
other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted 
in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain 
assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified 
in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. We also performed 
procedures in accordance with the circular issued by the Securities and Exchange Board 
of India under Regulation 33(8) of the Listing Regulations. to the extent applicable. 
4. The statement includes the results of the Mangalam Laboratories Private Limited a 
subsidiary.

taxable profit prepared by the management of the Holding Company which will be subject 
to audit. 
Modified Conclusion 
6. Based onour review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above, 
and based on our consideration of the review reports of the other auditors referred to in 
paragraph 7 below, except for the possible effects of the matter described in the “Basis 
for Modified Conclusion™ paragraph, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the accompanying Consolidated Statement, prepared in accordance with the 
recognition and measurement principles laid down in the applicable Indian Accounting 
Standards and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. has not disclosed 
the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52(4).

for the period from 1st April, 2025 to 30th September, 2025 as considered in the
