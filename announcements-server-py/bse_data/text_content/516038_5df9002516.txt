RISK FACTORS 
 
A.   RELATING TO THE OFFER 
 
The risk factors set forth below pertain to the Offer and are not in relation to the present or future 
business operations of the Target Company or other related matters, and are neither exhaustive nor 
intended to constitute a complete analysis of the risks involved in participation or otherwise by a 
shareholder in the Offer.  
 
1) The Offer involves an offer to acquire up to 26% of the Expanded Equity and Voting Share Capital of 
SPIL from the Eligible Persons for the Offer. In the case of over subscription in the Offer, acceptance 
would be determined on a proportionate basis and hence there is no certainty that all the shares 
tendered by the shareholders in the Offer will be accepted. 
 
2) As on date of this Letter of Offer, no statutory approvals are required in relation to this Offer. In the 
event that (a) a statutory and regulatory approval which may become applicable at later date and is 
not received in a timely manner, or (b) there is any litigation leading to a “stay” of the Offer, and 
then the Offer process may be delayed beyond the schedule of activities indicated in this Letter of 
Offer. Consequently, the payment of consideration to the shareholders of SPIL whose Shares has been 
accepted in the Offer as well as the return of Shares not accepted by the Acquirers may be delayed. 
 
3) In case of the delay, due to non-receipt of statutory approvals, as per Regulation 18(11) of the SEBI 
(SAST) Regulations, 2011, SEBI may, if satisfied that the non-receipt of approvals was not due to wilful 
default or negligence or failure to diligently pursue such approvals on the part of the Acquirers, grant 
an extension for the purpose of completion of the Offer subject to the Acquirers paying interest to the 
shareholders for the delay, as may be specified by SEBI. Without prejudice of Regulation 18(11) of the 
SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011 Acquirers shall pay interest for the period of delay to all such 
shareholders whose shares have been accepted in the open offer, at the rate of ten per cent per 
annum, however in case the delay was not attributable to any act of omission or commission of the 
Acquirers, or due to the reasons or circumstances beyond the control of Acquirers, SEBI may grant 
waiver from the payment of interest.

*The Negotiated price for preferential allotment per Equity Share i.e. the price at which equity shares

August 07, 2025 issued by Bhavesh M Rathod, Chartered Accountants, Registered Valuer - Securities or 
Financial Assets, (IBBI Registration No.: IBBI/RV/06/2019/10708) in accordance with Securities and 
Exchange Board of India (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018. Price arrived by 
valuer is Rs 3.72 per equity share. Further valuer has mentioned in his report that the present issue of 
Equity Shares shall result in change in control of the Company. Accordingly, valuer added the control 
premium of 5% to the value considering the Regulation 166A of SEBI ICDR Regulations. Accordingly, valuer 
after considering the control premium of 5% has arrived at value of Rs 3.90 per equity share, however 
valuer has informed that as per section 53 of Companies Act, 2013 the Company is prohibited to issue 
shares at discount to face value accordingly face value of equity shares of Target Company has been

**The Fair Value of equity share of the Target Company is Rs. 3.65/- (Rupees Three and Paisa Sixty-Five 
Only) as certified by CA Amit Maloo, Independent Valuer, (Membership No. 078498), Chartered 
Accountants, Registered Valuer - Securities or Financial Assets, having their office situated at Office No. 
305, 3rd Floor, Aditya Heritage, Mindspace, Malad West, Mumbai, Maharashtra – 400064 and Registered 
Address at B 1205, Ekta Terraces, Mahavir Nagar, Kandivali West, Mumbai 400067; Tel. No: +91

August 07, 2025. (UDIN: 25078498BMJOWN3685). 
 
The rationales for providing the multiples, as communicated by CA Amit Maloo, Independent Valuer 
are as below: 
 
a. Valuer has informed that, the Company has been non-operational for the past two years and has been 
continuously incurring losses. Being the Floor price of the company, 95% weightage is considered for 
NAV Method under the Asset Approach.  
b. Valuer has informed that, the value per share as per the CCM method is below the floor price i.e. the 
price as per the NAV method. Considering this, no weightage is considered for the CCM Method under 
the Market Approach. 
c. Valuer has informed that, the shares listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange are infrequently traded. 
However, a nominal weightage of 5% has been assigned to the Market Price Method under the Market 
Approach.  
d. Valuer has informed that, the Average profit after tax for the past three years is negative. Hence, no 
weightage is considered for the PECV method under the Income Approach. 
 
In view of the parameters considered and presented in table above, in the opinion of the Acquirers and 
Manager to the Offer, the Offer Price of Rs. 10/- (Rupees Ten only) per share being the highest of the 
prices mentioned above is justified in terms of Regulation 8 of the SEBI (SAST) Regulations, 2011.  
 
7.1.4 There has been no corporate action undertaken in the Target Company warranting adjustments in 
the offer price under Regulation 8(9) of SEBI SAST Regulations, 2011. 
 
7.1.5 There has been no corporate action requiring the price parameters to be adjusted.  
 
7.1.6 There are no reported event or information under Regulation 30 (11) of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 
2015 requiring price parameters to be adjusted. 
 
7.1.7 The Target Company is listed on BSE only. Equity shares of the Target Company were not traded 
on the date of public announcement (PA) i.e., August 07, 2025 and day before public 
announcement (PA) i.e., August 06, 2025 and day after public announcement (PA) i.e., August 08, 
2025. Prior to public announcement, equity shares of Target Company were last traded on 07th 
July, 2025 and market price (closing) was Rs. 65.26 per equity share. 
 
 
 
28 
 
7.1.8 In the event of any further acquisition of Equity Shares of the Target Company by Acquirers and 
PACs during the offer period, whether by subscription or purchase, at a price higher than offer 
price, then offer price will be revised upwards to be equal to or more than the highest price paid 
for such acquisition in terms of Regulation 8 (8) of the SEBI (SAST) Regulations. However, it shall 
not be acquiring any equity shares of Target Company after the third working day prior to 
commencement of tendering period and until the expiry of tendering period. 
 
7.1.9 If the Acquirers and PACs acquire any Equity Shares of the Target Company during the period of 
twenty-six weeks after the closure of Tendering Period at a price higher than the Offer Price, then 
the Acquirers and PACs shall pay the difference between the highest acquisition price and the 
Offer Price, to all shareholders whose Equity Shares have been accepted in this Offer within sixty 
days from the date of such acquisition. However, no such difference shall be paid in the event 
that such acquisition is made under another open offer under the Takeover Regulations, or 
pursuant to SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2021 or open market purchases made in 
the ordinary course on the stock exchange, not being negotiated acquisition of Equity Shares of 
the Target Company in any form. 
 
7.1.10 As on date of this LOF, there is no revision in the Offer Price or Offer Size. In case of any revision 
in the Offer Price or Offer Size, the Acquirers and PACs will comply with all the provisions of the 
Regulation 18(5) of the Takeover Regulations which are required to be fulfilled for the said 
revision in the Offer Price or Offer Size. 
 
7.1.11 If there is any revision in the Offer Price on account of future purchases / competing offers, it will 
be done only upto one working day prior to the date of commencement of the tendering period in 
accordance with Regulation 18(4) of the Takeover Regulations and would be notified to the

specified timelines. In the event that the number of Equity Shares (including demat Equity Shares, 
physical Equity Shares and locked-in Equity Shares) validly tendered by the Shareholders under this 
Offer is more than the number of Offer Shares, the Acquirers shall accept those Equity Shares validly 
tendered by the Shareholders on a proportionate basis in consultation with the Manager, taking care to 
ensure that the basis of acceptance is decided in a fair and equitable manner and does not result in 
non-marketable lots, provided that acquisition of Equity Shares from a Shareholder shall not be less 
than the minimum marketable lot.  
 
As per the recent amendment of SEBI vide its circular SEBI/HO/CFD/DCR-III/ CIR/P/2021/615 dated 
August 13, 2021, in consultation with Depositories, Clearing Corporations and Stock Exchanges, it has 
been decided that a lien shall be marked against the shares of the shareholders participating in the 
tender offers. Upon finalization of the entitlement, only accepted quantity of shares shall be debited 
from the demat account of the shareholders. The lien marked against unaccepted shares shall be 
released. The detailed procedure for tendering and settlement of shares under the revised mechanism 
is specified in the Annexure. All other procedures shall remain unchanged. 
 
The Offer involves an offer to acquire up to 26% of the Expanded Equity and Voting Share Capital of 
SPIL from the Eligible Persons for the Offer. In the case of over subscription in the Offer, acceptance 
would be determined on a proportionate basis and hence there is no certainty that all the shares 
tendered by the shareholders in the Offer will be accepted. 
 
The Equity Shares tendered in the Offer shall be held in trust by the Clearing Corporation /Registrar to 
the Offer until the completion of the Offer formalities and the Public Shareholders who have tendered 
their Equity Shares will not be able to trade in such Equity Shares during such period, even if the 
acceptance of equity Shares in this offer and/or dispatch of payment consideration are delayed. 
Further, during such period, there may be fluctuations in the market price of the Equity Shares that 
may adversely impact the Public Shareholders who have tendered their Equity Shares in this Offer. It is 
understood that the Public Shareholders will be solely responsible for their decisions regarding their 
participation in this Offer and the Acquirers do not make any assurance with respect to the market 
price of the Equity Shares at any time, whether during or after the completion of the Offer, and 
disclaim any responsibility or obligation of any kind (except as required by applicable law) with respect 
to any decision by any shareholder on whether to participate or not to participate in the Offer. 
 
9.18.  Settlement Process  
 
a) On closure of the Offer, reconciliation for acceptances shall be conducted by the Manager to the 
Offer and the Registrar to the Offer and the final list shall be provided to the Stock Exchange to 
facilitate settlement on the basis of Shares transferred to the Clearing Corporation. The settlement 
of trades shall be carried out in the manner similar to settlement of trades in the secondary 
market. Selling Brokers should use the settlement number to be provided by the Clearing 
Corporation to transfer the shares in favor of Clearing Corporation.  
 
b) The shares shall be directly credited to the pool account of the Buying Broker. For the same, the 
existing facility of client direct pay-out in the capital market segment shall be available. Once the 
basis of acceptance is finalised, the Clearing Corporation would facilitate clearing and settlement 
of trades by transferring the required number of shares to the pool account of the Buying Broker. In 
case of partial or non-acceptance of orders or excess pay-in, demat Shares shall be released to the 
34 
 
securities pool account of the Selling Broker / custodian, post which, the Selling Broker would then 
issue contract note for the shares accepted and return the balance shares to the Shareholders. Any 
excess physical Equity Shares, to the extent tendered but not accepted, will be returned to the 
Shareholder(s) directly by Registrar to the Offer.  
 
9.19.  Settlement of Funds/ Payment Consideration  
 
The settlement of fund obligation for demat and physical Equity Shares shall be effected through 
existing settlement accounts of Selling Broker. The payment will be made to the Buying Broker for 
settlement. For Equity Shares accepted under the Open Offer, the Selling Broker / Custodian 
Participant will receive funds payout in their settlement bank account. The Selling Brokers / Custodian 
participants would pay the consideration to their respective clients. The funds received from Buying 
Broker by the Clearing Corporation will be released to the Selling Broker(s) as per secondary market 
pay-out mechanism. Shareholders who intend to participate in the Offer should consult their 
respective Selling Broker for payment to them of any cost, charges and expenses (including brokerage) 
that may be levied by the Selling Broker upon the selling Shareholders for tendering Equity Shares in 
the Offer (secondary market transaction). The consideration received by the selling Shareholders from 
their respective Selling Broker, in respect of accepted Equity Shares, could be net of such costs, 
charges and expenses (including brokerage) and the Acquirers and PACs accepts no responsibility to 
bear or pay such additional cost, charges and expenses (including brokerage) incurred solely by the 
selling Shareholder. In case of delay in receipt of any statutory approval(s), SEBI has the power to 
grant extension of time to Acquirers for payment of consideration to the shareholders of the Target 
Company who have accepted the Open Offer within such period, subject to Acquirers agreeing to pay 
interest for the delayed period if directed by SEBI in terms of Regulation 18 (11) of the SEBI (SAST) 
Regulations, 2011.
