PSP: Pumped storage project | BESS: Battery Energy Storage System | CEA: Central Electricity Authority
Forecasted Demand & Supply Profile in FY30
Discharging
Charging India can solve the supply-demand mismatch by:
▪ Power demand management - shifting power load to daytime
▪ Flexing thermal and hydro
▪ Storage – Hydro PSP and Batteries
As per CEA’s National Electricity Plan – Volume II (Transmission), 
the peak demand by FY32 to be ~388 GW. RE contribution in the 
power supply is expected to increase from current 35% to 59% by 
FY32. Given the intermittent nature of RE sources, the energy 
storage systems are planned to be integrated in the grid - 47 GW 
BESS and 36 GW PSP capacity by FY32.
Policy level interventions has enabled integration of solar 
thereby shifting the evening peak to day time
▪ Separation of Agriculture feeders – enabling better load 
management, assured power supply during off-peak hours
▪ Promotion of solar pumps – subsiding solar powered irrigation
▪ Energy efficiency – Ujala scheme, Energy Conservation 
building code and smart metering
