STATEMENT 
Mumbai, November 19, 2025: Balaji Telefilms Ltd. today announced the rebranding of its premium 
astrology application, AstroVani by Balaji , which will now be known as Balaji Astro Guide . The 
updated name is effective immediately across all digital platforms, including Google Play Store, with 
the iOS launch to follow shortly. 
The decision to transition to Balaji Astro Guide  follows the overwhelming response the platform 
received since launch. As user adoption grew, several third -party platforms began surfacing with 
similar-sounding names, creating potential confusion for users seeking the official Balaji experience. 
To safeguard clarity, reinforce brand trust, and ensure unmistakable recognition, the company has 
moved to a name that directly carries the Balaji identity while clearly articulating the app’s purpose. 
Sanjay Dwivedi, Group CEO  and Group CFO , Balaji Telefilms Ltd said, “ The transition to Balaji Astro 
Guide is a step in reinforcing our brand’s strategic positioning within the spirituality -tech ecosystem. 
The new nomenclature strengthens brand recall, eliminates ambiguity, and positions the platform as 
a direct, authoritative guide for astrology, numerology, and spiritual insights under the trusted Balaji 
umbrella.”
