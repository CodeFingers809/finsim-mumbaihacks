Act, 2013 read with relevant rules issued there under and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the statement based on our

Scope of Review 
1.We conducted our review in accordance with the Standards on Review Engagement (SRE) 2410 
“Review of interim Financial Information performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity” 
issued by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). A review of interim financial 
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of the Company's personnel responsible for 
financial and accounting matters and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing 
specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act,2013 and consequently does not enable us 
to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified 
in an audit, Accordingly we do not express an audit opinion. 
2. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results prepared in accordance 
with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in accounting standards and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be 
disclosed in accordance in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015 (as amended), including the manner 
in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement. “Ks &AS
