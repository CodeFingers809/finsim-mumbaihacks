E-VOTING: 
 
Step 1 : Access through Depositories CDSL/NSDL e -
Voting system in case of individual    shareholders holding 
shares in demat mode.  
 
Step 2 : Access through NSDL e-Voting system in case 
of shareholders holding shares in physical mode and non -
individual shareholders in demat mode. 
 
(i) The voting period begins at 9:00 Hours (IST) on Sunday, 
November 16 , 2025  and ends at 17:00 Hours (IST) on 
Monday, December 15, 2025 . During this period

under Regulation 44 of Securities and Exchange Board of 
India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, listed entities are required to provide 
remote e-voting facility to its shareholders, in respect of all 
shareholders’ resolut ions. However, it has been observed 
that the participation by the public non -institutional 
shareholders/retail shareholders is at a negligible level.  
 
Currently, there are multiple e -voting service providers 
(ESPs) providing e -voting facility to listed en tities in India. 
This necessitates registration on various ESPs and 
maintenance of multiple user IDs and passwords by the 
shareholders.  
In order to increase the efficiency of the voting process, 
pursuant to a public consultation, it has been decided to 
enable e-voting to all the demat account holders, by way of 
a single login credential, through their demat accounts/ 
websites of Depositories/ Depository Participants . Demat 
account holders would be able to cast their vote without 
having to register again wi th the ESPs, thereby, not only 
facilitating seamless authentication but also enhancing ease 
and convenience of participating in e-voting process.  
Step 1 : Access through Depositories CDSL/NSDL e -
