UPON hearing the counsel the Court made the following 
0 R D E R 
1. The challenge herein is laid to the judgment dated 07.11.2025 
passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at 
Madras, whereby the order passed by the Intellectual Property 
Appellate Board (in short, the 11 IPAB") dated 08.03.2013 was set 
aside and the rectification filed by the respondent stands allowed, 
while that of the petitioner has been dismissed. 
2. There is a Trademark dispute between the parties, who are in 
the business of liquor manufacturing. The respondent's product is 
marked as nofficer's Choice" while the petitioner's product is 
known as noriginal Choice". Both parties, being aggrieved against 
the grant of Trademark to the other, sought rectification of the 
opponent's mark and approached the erstwhile IPAB. The Board 
rejected both the applications deeming the marks to be dissimilar 
and unlikely to deceive the public. Both parties then approached 
the High Court through cross writ petitions and vide the impugned 
judgment, the High Court al lowed the writ petition filed by the 
respondent and consequently, the order dated 08.03.2013 of the IPAB 
has been set aside and rectification filed by the respondent stands 
allowed. As a necessary corollary, the writ petition filed by the 
petitioner and its rectification have been dismissed. 
3. We have heard a battery of Senior Advocates appearing for both 
sides. Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, Mr. Shyam Divan, Mr. Sanjay Jain, and 
2 
Mr. Manmohan Singh, learned senior counsels appeared on behalf of 
the petitioner, whereas Mr. Harish Salve, Dr. Abhishek Manu 
Singhvi, Mr. Neeraj Kishan Kaul, Mr. Akhi l Sibal, and Mr. Puneet 
Bali, learned senior counsels appeared on behalf of the respondent. 
4. In the midst of the respective submissions, we have suggested 
the parties to explore the possibility of an amicable settlement 
through mediation. Both sides have very fairly agreed to take a 
chance and make an effort for such amicable resolution. 
5. In this regard, we deem it appropriate to request Hon'ble Mr. 
Justice L. Nageswara Rao, Former Judge of this Court, to act as the 
Mediator. Having regard to the nature of urgency involved, we 
request the learned Mediator to take up the matter on priority 
basis and make an endeavour to conclude the settlement process at 
the earliest. 
6. The parties are directed to contact Hon' ble Mr. Justice L. 
Nageswara Rao during the course of day with a request to His 
Lordship to fix a date for preliminary deliberations this week. 
7. The learned Mediator shall fix his own honorarium, which shall 
be shared by the parties equally. 
8. Post the matters on 08.12.2025. 
9. T.P.(C) Nos. 1333-1334/2024 and SLP{C) No. 6570-6571/2024 are 
taken on Board. 
10. Post the Transfer Petitions and SLP {C) No. 6570-6571/2024 on
