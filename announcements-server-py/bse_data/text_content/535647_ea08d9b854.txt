Statement') submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (the Regulation) read with SEBI 
Circular No. CIR/CFD/CMD 1/80/2019 dated July-19, 2019 (the Circular’). This statement is the responsibility of 
the Company's Management and has approved by the Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to issue a report 
on these financial statements based on our review. 
We have reviewed the accompanying stat 
ur review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410 
“Review of Interim Financial Information performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain 
moderate assurance as to whether the Statement is free of material misstatement. A review of interim financial 
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. 
and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit 
conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance 
that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do 
not express an audit opinion. 
We conducted o 
Based on our review conducted and procedures as stated above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us 
to believe that the accompanying Statements of Consolidated Unaudited Financial Results prepared in accordance 
with recognition and measurement principles laid down with aforesaid Accounting Standard and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in 
terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as 
amended, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement except 
for the matters included in the paragraph of conclusions as below. 
1) Out of the trade receivables of Rs.7,35,40,827, year-end direct balance confirmation in respect of 
trade receivables was not made available to us. Provision for Doubtful receivables as perceived by 
the management has been made for an aggregate amount of Rs. 1,03,55,356. In the absence of 
confirmation of balances for the remaining receivables, we are unable to confirm the adequacy of 
provision made, and the consequential effect of the balance receivables not provided for, if any, in 
the financial results for the year. 
2) TDS defaults appearing in TRACES is Rs.12,68,979.02 pertaining from FY 2014-15up to FY2025- 
26 (upto Q2) is outstanding as on the date of this report. Due to such statutorynon-compliance, we 
are unable to comment on the impact of actual liability and otherpenalties in the accompanying 
financial results.
