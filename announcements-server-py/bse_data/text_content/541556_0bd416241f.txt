Moderator 
 
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I am Karthikeyan, moderator for this conference. 
Welcome to the conference call of RITES Limited to discuss its Q2 FY26 Results. We have with 
us today, Mr. Rahul Mithal, Chairman and Managing Director; Dr. Deepak Tripathi, Director 
(Technical) and Director (Projects)- (Additional Charge) and Mr. Krishna Gopal Agarwal, 
Director (Finance) and Chief Financial Officer. 
 
At this moment, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-
answer session. At that time, if you have a question, please press * and 1 on your telephone 
keypad. Please note, this conference is being recorded and in the interest of time and fairness 
to all participants, you are requested to restrict yourself to one question per participant. Time 
permits, you may come back in the question queue. 
 
Now, I would like to hand over the floor to Mr. Rahul Mithal, Chairman and Managing Director, 
RITES Limited. Thank you, and over to you, sir. 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Good morning. Let me start with giving the Safe Harbor statement. The presentation and the 
press release, which we uploaded on our website and exchanges yesterday and discussions 
during the call today may have some forward-looking statements. These statements consider 
the environment we see as of today and obviously carry a risk in terms of uncertainty because 
of which the actual results could be different, and we do not undertake to update those 
statements periodically. 
 
Let me give you a brief overview of the overall performance of Q2, and then I leave the floor 
open for questions. It's been a satisfying quarter for us. In terms of the roadmap that we have 
set for ourselves at the beginning of the FY, if I look at it, five key points.  
 
One, we will like to maintain a one-order-a-day strike rate. And we did that. We got 150-plus 
orders totalling to INR 850 crore, which is about 1.6 orders a day. Two, we want to maintain 
one export order a quarter. We continued to maintain that. We got an order of INR 160 crore 
for 10 locomotives for South Africa in this quarter. Three, we want to achieve order book of 
INR 10,000 crore somewhere down the line, maybe as early as possible by end of this FY. We 
are heading in that direction. We added net to our order book by INR 300 crore and again 
reached an all-time high of INR 9,090 crore. Four, we want to do sequential growth for 
improved execution so that overall, on an annual basis, we surpassed the figures of last year, 
both top and bottom line. As you see, Q2 sequentially is it's about 12% better than the Q1 in 
revenue and PAT and EBITDA are in any case much higher. And five, we will like to secure our 
3 
RITES Limited 12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
margins, which as you see, the minimum baseline of about 20% in EBITDA margins and 15%-
odd in PAT margins, we have been above that. 
 
So in a nutshell, the direction which we had set, the key levers, the key operating points, we 
are moving in that direction. And the roadmap, as I said, which we have set ourselves in the 
beginning of the financial year, we are in line with that roadmap, moving to try and definitely 
surpass last year's performance. 
 
So that, in a nutshell, are the opening comments, and I'll leave the floor open for specific 
questions.

Thank you, sir. Now, we begin with the question-and-answer session. If you have a question, 
please press * and 1 on your telephone keypad. In the interest of time and fairness to all 
participants, you are requested to restrict yourselves to one question per participant. Time 
permits, you may join back the question queue. We will wait for a moment while the question 
queue assembles. Ladies and gentlemen, to ask a question, please press * and 1 on your 
telephone keypad. 
 
The first question comes from the line of Parimal Mithani from Credential Investments. Please 
go ahead. 
 
Parimal Mithani 
 
Thanks for the opportunity, and congratulations on a good set of numbers. 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Thank you, Parimal. Good morning. 
 
Parimal Mithani 
 
Yeah. So, I just wanted to know: in consultancy, the margin that you have grown, is it now 
steady state of margin that we'll have going forward from here? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
So, you see, normally, consultancy margins remain in the range of about ~30% odd. And we 
would like to maintain that. In a particular quarter, some low margin orders or in some high 
4 
RITES Limited 12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
margin orders may contribute. But by and large, on an equalized basis, on a long-term basis, 
those are the range of margins in the consultancy stream that we would like to maintain, and 
we have been maintaining that. If you see in the last 3-4 quarters, even if in this competitive 
regime and tough competition and tough margin, on an average basis, if you see in the 
preceding quarter, we'll be maintaining about 30% margins in the consultancy. 
 
Parimal Mithani 
 
And is it fair to assume that we'll have better execution and consultancy going ahead? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Yes. So, this quarter, in any case, consultancy and export are the two segments which have 
contributed to the overall performance. The turnkey is down by INR 90 crore YoY. And this 
INR 90 crore was compensated by consultancy & export. That's why you see the revenue 
nearly flat, about 1.5% growth only. But because of the change in mix, the INR 90 crore 
contributed to a higher margin mix, and that's why the EBITDA and PAT and margins have gone 
up. 
 
So consultancy wise this quarter has seen good execution, there has been about a 12% growth 
both YoY as well as sequentially. We'll continue to see better execution. 
 
Parimal Mithani 
 
Okay, sir. Thank you. I'll join back in the queue. Thank you, sir. 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Thank you. 
 
Moderator 
 
Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Raghav Maheshwari from Kanakia Wealth 
Management. Please go ahead. 
 
Raghav Maheshwari 
 
Hi, Sir. Congratulations on a great set of numbers. Sir, we are seeing improvement in the 
margins. We are seeing good growth. Can you show some light upon the top-line guidance? 
 
5 
RITES Limited 12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Yes. So, the top line has been flat, as I mentioned to Parimal, and that's primarily because the 
turnkey segment, which contributes to the top line, that about more than two-third of the order 
book is less than a year old. It's about eight, ten months old. And normally, the execution at the 
ground level and revenue booking starts nearly at the end of the year. So, Q3, Q4 by the time 
these orders reach a time of about a year, they will start contributing to revenue. 
 
So, even more INR 90 crore have been the hit due to turnkey, but in terms of bottom line, it 
resulted in a hit of only about INR 1 crore to INR 2 crore because the turnkey margins are 
always in the range of about 1% or 2%. So, when turnkey grows that will add to the top line. 
And with our continued stress on growth in the consultancy and exports, we will see the 
growth in the top line as we had laid down at the beginning of the FY. 
 
Raghav Maheshwari 
 
And what percentage growth are we looking at, if you can share the number? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
So, it depends on Q3, Q4 to what extent we are able to execute, but definitely aiming to see 
at least about trying to reach somewhere near a double-digit growth. Again, the coming months 
in terms of execution on the top line, on the turnkey projects, we'll see that. 
 
Raghav Maheshwari 
 
Okay. And the last question, what is the average turnaround time for the order book if you can 
give a bifurcation? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
It's a very difficult question to answer with one number because the four streams of revenue 
have different turnaround times.  
 
Raghav Maheshwari 
 
What I'm asking for bifurcation. 
 
 
 
6 
RITES Limited 12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Yes. So, a turnkey project takes about three to four years. An export project takes anything 
from two to two and a half years. Consultancy project could take anything from 90 days to 
about three years to four years if it is linked to the execution of the project. 
 
Raghav Maheshwari 
 
Understood, sir. Thank you, sir, and all the best. 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Thank you. 
 
Moderator 
 
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question, please press * and 1 on your 
telephone keypad. 
 
The next question comes from the line of Harshid Kapadiya from Elara Securities. Please go 
ahead. 
 
Harshid Kapadiya 
 
Yes. Thanks for the opportunity. And sir, congrats on a recovery on the export side and stable 
consultancy growth. My few question starts with, sir, so you mentioned some INR 90 crore hit 
is what you have done in turnkey. So, that particular revenue would be then booked in Q3? Is 
that what we'll be able to see when we see the Q3 results? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Well, it may not be INR 90 crore exactly because, as I said, more than two-third of the turnkey 
order book of INR 4,300 crore is about eight, ten months old. And considering a lifespan of 
about three years to four years, the initial designs, approvals, etc. at the site level, including 
fixing of the executing agency, the revenue booking normally, we have seen starts by the end 
of the first year. So, I foresee a bump in the turnkey revenue beginning from Q4/Q1. So while 
the efforts will be there, and that was my answer to the previous question also. And the 
gentleman was asking regarding the guidance for the top line growth. 
 
7 
RITES Limited 12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
We'll see how to best possible we can extract the turnkey execution in Q3, Q4, which will give 
us a better idea over the end of Q3 where we are heading in terms of top line growth. But 
definitely, the emphasis on trying to make good to the extent possible from consultancy and 
export, which was the effort in Q2, would continue in Q3, Q4. While the order size are much 
smaller; and therefore, they may not be able to fully contribute in terms of equalizing the top 
line, but definitely being better margin contributor, they contribute better to the bottom line. 
 
Harshid Kapadiya 
 
On domestic consultancy side, could you be able to share, sir, how has quality assurance grown 
within the consultancy for you? And within domestic consultancy, any specific area, whether 
it is related to housing or rail or airports or ropeways, what has seen the growth, sir? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Yes, Harshid. So, one very encouraging trend is that the quality assurance vertical has the tough 
times which we have seen in the last one and a half to two years but it has been steadily, 
sequentially improving, increasing and trying to garner new clients. And I must say that this has 
been one of the best quarters in the last six, seven trailing quarters in terms of reaching not 
only close to the levels which we were in terms of the revenue. 
 
Yes, margins are definitely now tougher being more in the competitive environment. In fact, 
more than two-thirds of the revenue in the quality assurance vertical is coming from the non-
IR client base, which shows the diversification, which we have been able to do in a span of 
about two years and now generating revenue from those clients. So, quality assurance is 
growing steadily. 
 
Another very good area, which is contributing to the consultancy revenue is, yes, our strong 
point in terms of rail infra as well as the third party quality orders that we are doing across 
various sectors of infrastructure, whether it is the highways or the buildings, various 
infrastructure. As also, we are getting good PMC contribution for some of the building projects 
that we are doing. So across sectors, the consultancy revenue has contributing and growing. 
And that's why you see about a 10% to 12% growth both YoY and sequentially in consultancy 
revenue. 
 
Harshid Kapadiya 
 
Understood, sir. That's really encouraging. Just a question on exports, sir. So, now that we have 
started seeing exports, what has been the delivery for us? This is for how many locos that we 
have delivered and how many coaches we have delivered? 
8 
RITES Limited 12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
Rahul Mithal 
 
So, the first deliveries have started of the locomotives, the Mozambique order of 10 
locomotives. So in quarter two, we could dispatch two locomotives. And that's when you see 
break in the hiatus for about nearly one and a half, two years. And now, export revenue has 
started generating revenue and it will be steady now in every quarter. In fact, subsequent to 
that, the next two locomotives have also been shipped out in the month of October, and they 
will contribute to the revenue in Q3. So, we continue to push three to four locomotives. We 
are hopeful that these 10 locomotives definitely by Q1 of next year, we should be able to 
complete this order. 
 
The coaches order, as I said, had a slight gap in the middle of last year for about four, five 
months that we have picked up now. There are about seven types of coaches, for which the 
designs of prototypes are more or less in the final stage. So, we are hopeful that the prototypes 
will start getting manufactured. And the first rake, we are definitely aiming to send out by Q1 
of next year. 
 
Harshid Kapadiya 
 
Understood, sir. I have more questions. I'll join in the question queue. 
 
Moderator 
 
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Uttam Srimal from Axis Securities Limited. 
Please go ahead. 
 
Uttam Srimal 
 
Yes sir. Very good morning, sir. And congratulations on good set of numbers. Sir, my question 
pertains to our export order book, which is currently around INR 1,541 crore. So, how much 
activation we are building on the next two quarters and in FY27? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Yes. Good morning. So, the three key elements of this order books are the Mozambique order, 
the Bangladesh coaches order and various orders of the in-service diesel locomotives to South 
Africa. We are definitely trying to complete the Mozambique order by the Q1. As I said, two 
locomotives, we have booked the revenue and see the booking of the revenue happens when 
the locomotives finally get the bill of lading. So even if they are ready, but only when they get 
loaded onto the vessel at the Mumbai Port, that's when we recognize the revenue. 
9 
RITES Limited 12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
 
The next two locomotives, which were shipped out in October, will figure in the revenue of 
Q3. We are trying to see that about six to seven locomotives get booked in this FY26 and the 
balance definitely by Q1 of FY26.  
 
As I mentioned regarding the coaches’ export project order to Bangladesh, these are 200 
coaches and seven different types of coaches. So the first rake, which Bangladesh Railways 
asked for, consists of four types of coaches, where we are at the final stages of getting the 
prototypes approved. And we are wanting to hoping that we can get the four prototype 
coaches manufactured and approved by them in Q4 so that the bulk manufacture starts in the 
first rake of 20 coaches moves out by Q1. 
 
So, your specific question regarding FY27, once this first rake moves out and the prototype 
would have been got approved, then I think one rake per quarter would definitely be the aim 
for FY27 for the Bangladesh order. 
 
Uam Srimal 
 
Okay, sir. I shall come back in a queue. Thanks. 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Yes. Thank you. 
 
Moderator 
 
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Gaurav, an individual investor. Please go 
ahead. 
 
Gaurav 
 
Hi sir. Good morning. Congratulations on the good set of numbers and taking my questions. 
Thank you so much for that. I just have one question. Can you just shed some light on the 
Bangladesh coaches order and the number of inductions in Q2? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
So, I just mentioned in my reply to the previous question, in the Bangladesh order, there are 
200 coaches and seven different types of coaches. The first shipment, we are aiming of a rake 
of 20 coaches by Q1 of FY27. The prototypes are in the stage of final approval and 
10 
RITES Limited 12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
manufacture by Q4. And once the prototypes are manufactured and approved, the bulk 
manufacturing will start. 
 
So starting from Q1, definitely, the next FY, the rake consisting of 20 coaches will subsequently 
be exported. A rake consisting of 20 coaches would go at one time. So, about 10 rakes are the 
total order for about 200 coaches. 
 
Gaurav 
 
Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much, sir. That's all from my side. Thank you. 
 
Moderator 
 
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Viraj Mithani from Jupiter Financial. 
Please go ahead. 
 
Viraj Mithani 
 
Yes, thank you for the opportunity, sir. Sir, my question is the order book which we have, the 
50% comes off the PMC business, right? So, are we changing our trend? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Good morning, Viraj. No. See, the breakup of the order book of INR 9,090 crore, there's about 
INR 4,300 crore turnkey, then INR 2,930 consultancy, export INR 1,540 crore and balance are 
leasing and REMC. So, we are very clear. We are not a construction company. We are purely a 
consultancy company. And the turnkey order book that you also see, it is because it's a method 
of accountal. 
 
Our scope of work and everything remains same of a consultant design. For example, the most 
recent order, which you saw, we got last week only for the NIMHANS facility at Bangalore, 
which is about INR 373 crore, our role in that is of a consultant only. 
 
It's a question of the accountal that the cost of the total project, including our consultancy fee 
flows through our top line, our balance sheet. Otherwise, we are very clear, we are a 
consultancy company, we are not a construction. So whether it is the turnkey order or the 
consultancy order, it's a question of only the method of financial accountal, our scope of work 
remains exactly the same. 
 
 
11 
RITES Limited 12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
Viraj Mithani 
 
Okay. And sir, so with this export order kicking in, we'll close the year more than the last year 
level? What will be the guidance for current year and the next year? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Yes, Viraj. With the export revenue now kicking in and building up and consultancy showing a 
steady growth of 10%-plus and as also the young order book in turnkey will start generating 
revenue definitely by end of the FY, we should be definitely a minimum be able to touch the 
levels of last year top and bottom line, but we are definitely aspiring to grow above that both 
in top and bottom lines. 
 
Moderator 
 
Thank you so much, sir. Next, we have a follow-up question from the line of Parimal Mithani 
from Credential Investments. Please go ahead. 
 
Parimal Mithani 
 
Sir, I just wanted to know if the MoU signed with parties in in Middle-East, any updates there? 
And also, your JV with DNV, can you just highlight if anything meaningful is happening there, 
sir? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Okay. Yeah. So, first your first question first. The MOUs in Middle-East, those have, in a short 
period of time of less than one year, started giving us gains already. The MoU with Etihad Rail 
has got us work in Jordan, which we are doing with them. We are also now partnering with 
them in providing consultancy services by deploying our people and our expertise in their 
various projects in Middle-East and beyond. And we see in such a short time, we are able to 
capitalize on that, and we see huge potential moving forward. We've already set up an office 
in UAE. So, I see this grow moving forward. 
 
The other question regarding the partnership with DNV, Italy was regarding the ISA 
certification, which we are doing for Vande Bharat coaches for the Indian Railways. And it's 
been moving successfully. And we are doing the ISA certification for manufacture of new 
Vande Bharat rakes. 
 
 
12 
RITES Limited 12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
Parimal Mithani 
 
Okay, sir. And sir, just last one, in terms of leasing business, do we see any traction going ahead 
more? Because we're seeing a good growth there, the first half. 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Yes, leasing business has been substantially growing despite newer players trying to come in 
and trying to hit the margins. But we are growing sequentially. We've already reached the 
target of being more than 100-plus locomotives of our own, which we are leasing besides doing 
O&M of clients' locomotives. 
 
So, the way we are getting orders in in leasing constantly, this is a growing segment both in 
terms of the revenue as well as the contribution to the bottom line. 
 
Parimal Mithani 
 
Okay, sir. Thank you. Thank you very much. 
 
Moderator 
 
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question, please press * and 1 on your 
telephone keypad. 
 
We have a follow-up question from Viraj Mithani from Jupiter Financial. Please go ahead. 
 
Viraj Mithani 
 
Yes, sir. My question was, we signed so many MOUs with so many companies. How is it going 
to help us? Like, anything materially happening there? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Yes, Viraj. All these MOUs in some way or the other, the umbrella MoUs and it'll differ, 
obviously, from case to case and geography to geography. But as I mentioned to Parimal in the 
last question, for example, the MoU with Etihad Rail has helped us already expand to new 
geographies where we were primarily operating in Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America, now 
we have started getting work in the Middle-East geography. 
 
13 
RITES Limited 12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
So similarly, MoUs in the domestic sector with various entities. And one MOU, like I mentioned, 
in the inspection quality assurance vertical, which has helped us jointly do the ISA certification 
for Vande Bharat rakes. So similarly, in consultancy, our MOUs with various players depending 
on where we end up doing work in a particular bid, in a particular geography. Each one of them 
have different potential. And that's why we very carefully enter into strategic MOUs. 
 
We recently entered into an MoU last week, you must have seen with the DG naval projects 
in Mumbai. So, we see a huge -- we're already working with them in in one or two projects, and 
we see that more potential in that sector. 
 
Viraj Mithani 
 
Okay. And sir, my question is on our policy of exports now with this two orders kicking in. Have 
we made some goals for exports as a segment? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Yes. Our goal for export segment is, one, that we will continue to try and achieve one order a 
quarter, which we have been doing now for about seven, eight trailing quarters. We will 
continue to get that. And normally, the export order starts generating revenue after about one 
and a half, two years, about 18 months or so. And that's why you see the first order that we 
got in early 2024, that has got generated revenue in Q2 now. 
 
So with this, you will see over a period of time. And one of the objectives is that once now we 
have a sufficient variety and number of export orders, what we want to avoid is spikes in 
booking of the export revenue. Like you saw it in the last two, three years, there was hardly 
any contribution by the export revenue. And now our aim is that every quarter, you don't see 
a blank in the export revenue, you see a substantial contribution from the export revenue. So, 
that's one objective, which we will definitely achieve. Now, you'll see that regularly in the 
coming quarters of revenue from export vertical. 
 
Viraj Mithani 
 
Okay. That's it from my side. All the best, sir. 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Thank you. Thank you, Viraj.

Moderator 
 
Thank you. Next, we have a follow-up question from Raghav Maheshwari from Kanakia Wealth 
Management. Please go ahead. 
 
Raghav Maheshwari 
 
Yes. So sir, just a couple of follow-ups on the order intake. We have been maintaining one 
order per day track record for past many quarters now. To understand a bit upon the 
competitive landscape, how are we going to maintain that? First question. And second is, for 
that matter, what is the average ticket size of the order that we take? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
So rather, the first question is that as the competitive scenario is evolving more and more, 
when we set this target about eight quarters back, we were in the range of about 0.6, 0.7 strike 
rate. And we had to do a lot of business reengineering to be able to reach that milestone. And 
we have set few boundary lines both in not sacrificing the margin beyond a certain point. And 
two, not picking up small ticket size orders just for getting number of orders. So, with those 
broad boundary lines in each of the 13 verticals that we have, various sectors, we have now 
been able to maintain that. So if you see, it's not only the number of one order a day, it's also 
the value. 
 
For example, we got in Q2 about 150 orders totalling to INR 850 crore. And you could see a 
net addition in the order book from June 30 to September 30 of INR 300 crore. So, while the 
size of the order may vary depending on a particular sector or the nature of work, because as 
you see, we have four broad streams of revenue. But what we ensure is that we will not pick 
up, as I said, two red lines. One, ticket size of orders below a certain value just to increase the 
number of orders. And two, sacrifice the margin and unnecessarily dilute our level of quality in 
terms of the execution of order that we intend to do. 
 
Raghav Maheshwari 
 
Can you share that, like, the minimum order average value that you would not go beyond? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
You see, again, it varies from each of the different verticals. It varies on the four different 
streams of revenue where the size of order can be huge in terms of export or in terms of 
turnkey segment. But in terms of some consultancy, they could be small orders. In consultancy, 
15 
RITES Limited 12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
there are three, four different types of work that we do. We could do a DPR, which is, again, a 
smaller value order. It could be a PMC, where it's a percentage-based order, where your value 
depends on a percentage of the infrastructure work or it could be a third-party audit, TPI, third 
party inspection of a completed infrastructure project. So again, to give one number would be 
a misnomer. But yes, for each of the different verticals as well as for each of the different 
scopes of work, we have set some internal red lines for both in terms of the ticket size as well 
as the margins that we claim.

Thank you. Next, we have a follow-up question from Gaurav, an individual investor. Please go 
ahead. 
 
Gaurav 
 
Hi, sir. Thank you again for taking my question. I just wanted to know about the number of 
employees. Last year, it was around in the range of 2,700 and now increased to 2,800-plus. So, 
where do you see this number going? And what were the additions in H1? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
So, yes, we are at about 2,800, and we are considering that our order size is constantly 
increasing. In H1, we have inducted about 300 people. And you would see that only there's a 
net increase of roughly about 100 because a large number of superannuations have also been 
happening because considering that we are about 51 years old, there was a huge induction in 
the company in its initial years in the '90s when the company was diversifying, growing in its 
2-3 decade. And those are the large number of employees, which are now in the span of three 
years to four years superannuation after completing about 30, 35 years of service. 
 
So, while there is a large number of superannuation, we are inducting in a big way so that net, 
you can see an increase. And this trend of superannuation will plateau down after about maybe 
a year or year and a half or so. However, our induction is going to continue both for our project-
16 
RITES Limited 12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
based employees, which as we get more and more orders, we are inducting employees on a 
specific project. So, this number overall, which includes both our regular employees and 
project-based employees, will go on increasing as you see in every successive quarter. 
 
Gaurav 
 
Thank you, sir. Thank you. That's it from my side. Thank you.

Thank you. Next, we have a follow-up question from Harshid Kapadiya from Elara Securities. 
Please go ahead. 
 
Harshid Kapadiya 
 
Yes. Hi. Sorry, sir, I missed the call last time. So, just wanted to check where are we on the 
export order inflow, sir, which we have been targeting one order a year? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Yes. Harshid, in fact, it's one order a quarter. We have set ourselves a target of one order a 
quarter, eight quarters back, and we are maintaining that. And this quarter also, we got that 
one order. This is 10 in service locomotives to South Africa at about INR 160 crore. 
 
So, we had set ourselves a target at the beginning of 2024 of trying to get one export order a 
quarter, and we are maintaining that successively for about seven, eight trailing quarters now. 
 
Harshid Kapadiya 
 
Okay. And for, let's say, second half also, you expect some of the order announcements to 
come and our target is largely Middle-East and Africa as a market, sir? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
In terms of export of rolling stock, it is primarily Africa and Southeast Asia. And as I said, all our 
efforts are on to maintain one export order a quarter. And that is the basic reason, as I 
mentioned a few questions back, is very important to have a diversified large number of orders 
in the export order book so that they are at different stages of execution. And despite of 
revenue generation from the export segment, which we suffered in the last two, three years, 
there was a gap, if you see, we will now be able to ensure, and that's the strategy that every 
17 
RITES Limited 12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
quarter, you see some contribution, this being the first quarter after a long gap that you saw 
an export revenue of INR 60 crore, that now on a regular basis, every quarter, we should be 
able to have a contribution from the export revenue. 
 
And that is only possible if you have large number of export orders in different geographies at 
different stages of manufacture and execution. 
 
Harshid Kapadiya 
 
And all these are competitive bidding, as in global competitive bidding, or are these on 
nomination business, sir? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Most of them were on competitive bidding, but some of these i.e. the South Africa in service 
locomotives orders, these were on nomination because we have -- this is a proprietary kind of 
work. We took a lot of initiative in trying to finalize the design to use the in-service locomotives, 
which Indian Railways has large number of diesel locomotives now and are available because 
of electrification. How best to modify them to the gauge and customize them to the 
requirement of South Africa and be able to get the designs modified and approved by them 
and export to them. 
 
So, these are a very kind of a proprietary design-specific work, which we are working on, and 
we've got some orders on that from South Africa. But the bigger orders from Mozambique and 
Bangladesh were all competitive. 
 
Harshid Kapadiya 
 
Fine, sir. I have few more questions. I'll join in the queue. 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Yeah.

RITES Limited 12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
Anand B 
 
Good morning. I just wanted to know the margins that you earn differentiate between, let's 
say, margins that you earn from consultancy orders, margins that you earn from export, margins 
that you earn from turnkey. Can you just give a breakup of that? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Yes. So, the margins traditionally in the consultancy are the highest. They are in the range of 
30%- odd. The turnkeys are always lower. They are about 1.2%, 1.1%. And export because this 
is the first order, the first quarter that the revenue has been booked. So, while this is in the 
range of about 10%, and this is the kind of range, maybe it'll be a better picture as revenues 
flow in over two, three successive quarters because the cost booking and the revenue, etc. will 
equalize and we'll be able to get a better idea of the margins. 
 
In terms of leasing, our margins have always been in the range of about 30%-odd. So, these are 
the four broad segments of margins. As you see, the large range from turnkey to consultancy 
to export to leasing. 
 
Anand B 
 
Okay. And final question, what sort of revenue division that you see between these four key 
segments this year and next year as well? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
As I mentioned, the turnkey is they are all young order book. So while this quarter, you've seen 
a very low contribution from turnkey. This will start growing by Q4/Q1. And in terms of its 
contribution to the top line, it will definitely grow. Consultancy has been growing steadily at 
the rate of 10%, 12%, which we will aim that it continues growing. 
 
Export, the revenue booking has started. And we definitely as the roadmap that I laid out for 
the Mozambique locos as well as the Bangladesh coaches, we will definitely see revenue 
coming in every quarter. So the mix between the various segments may differ from quarter to 
quarter, but that's the trend which you can see. And maybe a better picture would emerge of 
the total overall percentage of each of the segment over an annual basis. So in a particular 
quarter, it may vary depending on the deliveries. 
 
 
 
19 
RITES Limited 12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
Anand B 
 
Okay. So, I think to annual also, but just to get some clarification. So let's say, if the share of 
export revenue goes up, does that mean, like, the share of revenue, let's say, turnkey or leasing 
comes down because of that? Or how does it work? Like, what grows vis-a-vis to another? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
No, they are not interlinked. You see, the point is that overall, there are two broad directives 
or two broad guardrails of the things that the overall things that we want to achieve. And that's 
the overall growth in the top and bottom line, while still securing our overall EBITDA margins 
at 20%-plus and PAT margins of 15% red line minimum, both these two 20% and 15%. 
 
Now as I explained, the variation in margins across the four streams is so large, what we 
definitely try and achieve while we don't sacrifice or pull up one for the other, but we definitely 
keep an interblend mix between the four segments so that the overall, there is a growth in top 
line, bottom line with these two red lines having been maintained of 15% and 20% in EBITDA 
and PAT margins. 
 
Anand B 
 
Okay. Thank you so much.

Thank you. Next, we have a follow-up question from Viraj Mithani from Jupiter Financial. 
Please go ahead. 
 
Viraj Mithani 
 
Yes, sir. Thank you for the opportunity. Sir, my question is what will be your OpEx and what 
will be our dividend policy? Would it the same as last year's or some change will be there? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Yes, Viraj. I have committed always in the last more than a number of quarters that you will 
not come up with any surprise of us suddenly putting our capital somewhere or doing 
something away from our basic business model or suddenly changing our colour from a 
consultancy company to some other company. So, we are very clear in our strategy and our 
business model, and we will continue to try and improve on that and give better performance. 
20 
RITES Limited 12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
 
So with that, our basic requirement of being a debt-free company, low-CapEx company, 
literally minimum working capital requirement, I don't foresee any reason of us not maintaining 
the healthy dividend payout ratio that we have been maintaining. And as you'll see this quarter 
also, we maintained about 94% dividend payout ratio. 
 
Viraj Mithani 
 
Okay. Thank you, sir. Thank you. 
Moderator 
 
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Sahaj Arora, an individual investor. Please 
go ahead. 
 
Sahaj Arora 
 
Hi. Good morning, sir. Thanks for the opportunity. I just wanted to check with you. Like you 
said, in the PMC business, due to the accounting policies, you have to, like, pass it through the 
revenue. What percentage of that revenue would be our consultancy income? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Not in the PMC business, in the turnkey business. 
 
Sahaj Arora 
 
Sorry. 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
In the turnkey business, the revenue passes through us. So again, we get most of our orders on 
competitive basis. So for example, let's say, our consultancy fee for discussion is about 5% or 
6%. Now, if we had got that as a consultancy order, our value of order would have been INR 6 
crore. If we get it as a turnkey order, its value is INR 106 crore. 
 
So, if it's a turnkey order, INR 106 crore passes through our balance sheet. If that order was a 
pure consultancy order, INR 6 crore would pass through our balance sheet. That's the only 
difference in accountal. Our scope of work and responsibility, everything remains identical. 
 
 
21 
RITES Limited 12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
Sahaj Arora 
 
And the margins also remain identical like the consultancy business? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
No. Obviously, because the margins in a turnkey business, the denominator being much larger, 
they are in the range of 2%-odd, 1% to 2%. And consultancy, definitely, it is much larger, in the 
range of about 30%-odd. 
 
Sahaj Arora 
 
Yeah, but like you said, INR 6 crore would be the consultancy income. On that, the margins 
would be what you guide for the consultancy business, is that correct understanding? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
If it was a consultancy order, if the order was in the form of a consultancy order, if the value 
of the order was INR 6 crore, then it would be accounted in our consultancy order book and 
the margins would be higher. But if the order value would be INR 106 crore, then it would be 
accounted for in our turnkey order book and the margins and the contribution from the margins 
in the turnkey could be much lesser. 
 
Sahaj Arora 
 
Okay. Thank you, sir. 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Right.

Next, we have a follow-up question from Harshid Kapadiya from Elara Securities. Please go 
ahead. 
 
22 
RITES Limited 12.11.2025 
Q2 FY26 Results Conference Call 
Harshid Kapadiya 
 
Yes. Thanks for the opportunity again, sir. Just wanted to check with you, since you mentioned 
that after first year, the turnkey construction generally started booking the revenue. So, when 
is the peak revenue expected from your INR 4,000 crore order book? Will it be like FY28-29? 
Is that correct? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
I would see the revenue start picking up in a big way by latter part of FY27. Because as I 
mentioned at the outset, about two-thirds of this order book are young. They are about eight 
to ten months old, and I foresee them starting to generate revenue by Q4 or maybe Q1 of next 
FY. 
 
So, maybe latter part of FY27, say, Q3 onwards, H2 of FY27, there should be a substantial 
bump from these young orders while you're continuing to get fresh orders, which, as I said, 
with a lifespan of about three years to four years will maintain that trend of turnkey revenue. 
But you would see a bump coming in from latter part of FY27. 
 
Harshid Kapadiya 
 
Understood, sir. Thanks for the clarification. And just on consultancy, you had said that, is there 
any large order expectation which is there in the pipeline, like one we heard about, there's a 
high-speed rail corridor, which is where the consultancy work is out for Delhi connecting to 
Jammu? 
 
So, are you guys participating in any other such large consultancy tender, which is out, which, 
if we win, could be a bump up for us? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Harshid, I would not like to speculate on orders which are in the pipeline, but I can only say 
maintaining one-plus order a day, we are bidding on large number of orders. And more than 
two-thirds of these, about 70% are on a competitive basis. So, whether it is domestic or 
international, we are bidding for a large number of consultancy orders across various sectors, 
including rail, infra, etc. And we will keep most recently, we got the IIM Bangalore PMC order 
in our building vertical, which was about 14 crore. So, we continue to get the orders. 
 
In our QA vertical, we've got orders for various consultancy work in the QA. So, we will 
continue to bid, but it'll not be proper for me to speculate an order that are in pipeline.

Moderator 
 
Thank you. Next, we have a follow-up question from Anand B from Ksema Wealth Private 
Limited. Please go ahead. 
 
Anand B 
 
Thanks for the opportunity again. I just want to know what would be like the seasonality of 
your business? I mean, I agree that export will be, is this a new what do you say, see one export 
a quarter as well. But for consultancy, turnkey and leasing, what will be the seasonality across 
the four quarters? Which quarter will do better? Which quarter will do not that great? 
 
Rahul Mithal 
 
Yeah. So, I was saying, Anand, that in case you lost me, now we are getting revenue from each 
of these streams, for example, in export. The Mozambique order that we got in '24 early, early 
2024, this was the first quarter that it started generating revenue because the locomotives 
have started getting manufactured and started getting exported. And now, we see that 
continuously, whether it's the Bangladesh order or the Mozambique order, the export stream 
will generate revenue continuously irrespective of the seasonality in every quarter. 
 
Similarly, in the turnkey, the young order book, they are now in the stage that by Q1, latest of 
next year, you will see a substantial contribution from the young turnkey orders because they 
would be about 12 months to 15 months old and execution would start at the ground level. 
 
Consultancy orders consist we have a large bouquet of consultancy orders, small and big. And 
they generate revenue regularly on every quarter irrespective of the particular quarter. So, 
that's why you see a steady growth of about 10% to 12%, both YoY and sequentially in the 
consultancy segment. 
 
So, each of these segments in the coming quarters have a different time line of generating 
revenue, turnkey being the one which will start seeing substantial increase in the next FY.

the outset, this has been a satisfying quarter for our team that we are moving in the right 
direction in the roadmap, in line with the roadmap that we had set at the beginning of the FY. 
 
And I'm sure that we will continue our focus on improved execution in Q3, Q4, so that 
definitely not only touch the levels of last year, but try and exceed them both in top and bottom 
line while securing our margin, definitely exceed the top and bottom line by a substantial 
quantum.
