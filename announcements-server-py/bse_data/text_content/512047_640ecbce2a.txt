LIMITED REVIEW REPORT 
To  
Board of Directors of  
Royal India Corporation Limited  
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of unaudited standalone financial results of Royal India 
Corporation Limited (“the Company”) for the quarter and half year ended 30th September, 2025 (“the 
Statement”).  
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company’s management and approved by the Board of 
Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian 
Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” (“Ind AS 34”), prescribed under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with 
Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. Our responsibility is to issue a report on the Statement based on our 
review.  
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410 
“Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity” issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain 
moderate assurance as to whether the Statement is free of material misstatement. A review is limited primarily to 
inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus provide less 
assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.  
4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 
accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with applicable Indian accounting standards and other 
recognized accounting practices and policies has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms 
of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 including the 
manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
