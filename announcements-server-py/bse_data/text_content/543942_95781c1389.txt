MFI Current Scenario
▪ Overall Industry growth has decelerated, and the industry contracted by 
~17% (Q1’FY25-Q1’FY26) due to:-
▪ Implementation of guardrails aimed at fostering more sustainable 
lending practices
▪ Cautious lending decisions by institutions to mitigate MFI risk
▪ Restrictions on acting as 4th/5th microfinance lender
Support from RBI
◼ Reduction in risk weights on microfinance loans and bank loans to NBFCs 
◼ Reduced PSL requirement from 75% to 60% for all SFBs enhancing capital utilization towards lower risk assets
Other Policy Support
◼ CGFMU* initiative by the government to insure micro loans has further strengthened the sector by significantly de-
risking lenders’ portfolios

months
▪ Collection staff allocated bucket-wise
▪ Upon normalization the collection force will be retained for legacy NPA book & write off collections
