Semi Annual Report 2025-26
Dear Unitholders,
It is my privilege to present to you the 
semi-annual report for HI FY 2025–26. 
These last six months have been a 
standing testimony on delivery of our 
vision set eight years back, of creating 
unitholder value, chasing sustainable 
growth and creating an impactful 
energy delivery platform. 
While pursuing this, not only have we 
delivered a total return of 174% at a 
staggering annualised rate of 13%, but 
we have also added a robust  
INR 60+ Billion development pipeline, 
which is poised to grow further with the 
upcoming bid pipeline.
Growth has been a steady pillar in our 
pursuit of excellence, and with ever 
evolving grid and dynamically 
changing stakeholders, our key focus 
going forward from here is to ensure 
that IndiGrid evolves into a diversified 
and future-ready energy 
infrastructure platform – one that not 
only delivers predictable cash flows 
but is equally attuned to India’s 
energy transition priorities.
Evolving Sector Landscape and 
Structural Opportunity
The energy sector in India is 
undergoing a massive transformation, 
with greener energy mix, evolving 
delivery models and increasing 
number of use cases across industries 
in mobility and manufacturing. As the 
generation mix shifts towards 
renewables and peak demand 
accelerates, transmission and 
storage infrastructure will play a 
defining role in enabling grid flexibility, 
reliability, and last-mile delivery.
By current estimates, India’s peak 
power demand is expected to cross 
360 GW by 2032, requiring ~900 GW of 
installed generation capacity – over 
two thirds of which is anticipated to 
come from renewable sources. This 
shift will necessitate a corresponding 
ramp-up in transmission capacity  
(~1,70,000 ckms), transformation 
capacity (~1,200 GVA), and grid-scale 
partnership with British International 
Investment (BII) and Norfund, to 
develop greenfield transmission and 
standalone battery energy storage 
projects in India. 
EnerGrid leverages IndiGrid’s strong 
execution track record and 
understanding of the Indian energy 
sector, while BII and Norfund bring 
long-term capital and global 
expertise in climate-focussed 
infrastructure. Together, the platform 
aims to create a robust pipeline of 
projects that will eventually be 
acquired by IndiGrid post- 
commissioning, offering a capital- 
efficient route to growth.
The seeds of collaboration have now 
started to stem up on the solid 
foundation built, with over 50% of the 
commitment already identified for 
deployment till date. 
Given the execution capability of the 
team and the unique positioning of 
EnerGrid, we see significant long-
term impact being created by 
EnerGrid, deploying more and more 
capital meaningfully in the coming 
years.
ESG – Embedded, Evolving, and 
Measurable
The pillar of growth is built on the 
foundations of sustainability. 
Sustainability is embedded into our 
platform, partnerships, and decisions. 
Envisaged over the last few years, our 
ESG strategy has evolved further, 
adding clear metrics, aligning internal 
systems, and enhancing governance 
structures continuously.
Our partnerships with BII, Norfund, 
GEAPP, and IFC reflect the confidence 
that global climate capital places in 
our ability to deliver measurable 
environmental and social outcomes. 
The embodiment of global best 
practices now starts at the 
development stage continuing into 
the operational stage, with a clear 
The year so far has been 
focused on meaningful 
capacity addition. On 
one hand, we acquired 
over INR 21 Billion worth 
of operational 
transmission and utility 
solar assets adding to 
our Southern region 
presence, and on the 
other hand we have 
emerged as successful 
bidders in BESS 
development projects 
adding capacity in the 
Northern region, further 
bolstering our growing 
pipeline and expanding 
national footprint. 
Battery Energy Storage (~47 GW) – 
collectively demanding investments 
of over INR 9 Trillion.
This large-scale opportunity itself 
provides headroom for IndiGrid to 
grow and expand. Channelisation of 
long-term capital available to us, 
coupled with an experience delivery 
team and our reliable network of 
partners, we remain poised to not 
only grow rapidly but remain at the 
forefront in meeting India’s energy 
delivery goals.
EnerGrid – Building the Future of 
Grid Infrastructure
Last year, we launched EnerGrid, a 
dedicated platform formed in

focus on creating a uniform 
measurable outcome at the portfolio 
level.
While we continue to invest in safety, 
skill development, and community 
engagement, we are now embedding 
sustainability into core engineering 
and operational workflows – from 
intelligent water usage in solar 
cleaning operations to the adoption 
of responsible waste disposal 
protocols and site-specific 
biodiversity preservation initiatives. 
Newer projects are being designed 
with environmental sensitivity as a 
key input, not a postscript – ensuring 
that landscape impact, material 
circularity, and long-term ecological 
stability are considered from the 
outset.
Our first sustainability report 
published for FY 2024-25 is a step 
forward, we endeavour to benchmark 
and calibrate our impact periodically 
with an aim to create a transparent 
and world class ESG coherent 
platform.
Expanding Our Under-
Construction Footprint
Our development portfolio, which is 
held directly under IndiGrid, has six 
projects under construction 
comprising four greenfield ISTS 
transmission assets and two large-
scale Battery Energy Storage System 
(BESS) projects – each contributing 
to the grid enhancement and 
strengthening, especially delivery of 
round the clock green energy.
On the transmission front, our under-
construction portfolio includes 
projects totalling approximately 504 
circuit kilometres of transmission 
lines and 5,000 MVA of transformation 
capacity, including the recently 
awarded Ratle Kiru Power 
Transmission Limited (RKPTL) – a 
strategically important project 
supporting hydro evacuation from 
Jammu & Kashmir.
In the storage domain, we have built 
a strong foundation with the 
successful commissioning of KBPL. 
With this, and the addition of Gujarat 
BESS Private Limited (GBPL) and 
Rajasthan BESS Private Limited (RBPL) 
both currently under construction, 
IndiGrid’s total BESS portfolio on a 
standalone basis would enhance to 
450 MW/900 MWh. The experience 
and capabilities demonstrated in the 
timely and safe delivery of KBPL 
provide us with strong conviction and 
operational readiness to successfully 
execute the remaining BESS projects. 
In addition to the new projects, we 
have been mandated across our 
existing projects for future expansion. 
With the current development 
pipeline, we now have presence 
across 20 states and 2 union 
territories across India. 
In addition to the assets under 
construction in IndiGrid, EnerGrid has 
successfully bid for two BESS projects 
in Uttar Pradesh during the current 
half year with estimated capital 
expenditure of ~INR 19 Million.
Robust Performance and 
Distribution Delivery
During H1 FY 2025-26, IndiGrid’s 
financial performance reflected both 
the strength of our core portfolio and 
the prudence of our capital strategy. 
We ended the financial half year with 
an Assets Under Management (AUM) 
of INR 325 Billion, supported by a 
balanced mix of operational 
resilience and disciplined 
reinvestment. Our Net Debt to AUM 
stood at 61.4%, slightly higher than FY 
2024-25 on account of recent 
acquisitions, but still comfortably 
providing us with meaningful 
headroom to pursue growth 
opportunities while maintaining 
financial stability.
Our operating fundamentals 
remained strong – with Revenue from 
Operations and EBITDA at INR 16,666 
Million and INR 14,287 Million 
respectively during H1 FY 2025-26. 
Comparable Net Distributable Cash 
Flow (NDCF), which is our key delivery 
metric, stood at INR 6,491 Million.
Our performance, fuelled by the 
efficiencies we have built into our 
system and processes over the years, 
has helped us consistently provide 
growing returns to our unitholders. 
We had already increased our DPU 
guidance last year by 6.7% to  
INR 16.00 per unit for the current 
financial year 2025-26 and we remain 
on track to deliver the same to our 
unitholders.
Operational Excellence through 
Digitisation and Reliability
Operational excellence remains a 
cornerstone of IndiGrid’s value 
Growth potential in the energy sector is  
unprecedented. With mainstream integration of 
battery storage and ever urgent focus on green 
transition, private investment is warranted more than 
ever. An enormous INR 1.3 Trillion bid pipeline has 
already been identified across battery and 
transmission space alone and is up for bidding in 
near future.

Semi Annual Report 2025-26
proposition – not only as a metric of 
performance, but as a philosophy 
embedded across our asset lifecycle. 
Ever since last fiscal, we have 
continued to strengthen system 
availability and reliability through a 
combination of predictive analytics, 
advanced digital platforms, and 
proactive field interventions.
Our proprietary platform, DigiGrid, 
now forms the digital backbone of 
our operations – enabling real-time 
performance monitoring, anomaly 
detection, and remote diagnostics 
across all transmission and solar 
assets. Supported by drone-based 
inspections, robotic solar module 
cleaning, and predictive weather 
intelligence, these interventions have 
allowed us to shift from periodic 
maintenance to condition-based 
upkeep, optimising both reliability 
and cost efficiency.
In the current financial year, we have 
transitioned to a bigger and efficient 
Central Control Room in Noida, 
tracking all our assets remotely, 
complementing our site teams with 
technology and analytics for better 
uptime.
Our availability for the transmission 
system continues to be 99.4%, and we 
continue to make our transmission 
systems more robust by pre-emptive 
upgrades, timely maintenance and 
efficient use of technology. On the 
solar side, we have seen a slight dip in 
performance with CUF slipping to 
22.2%, largely however on account of 
lower irradiation.
Looking Ahead
As India accelerates its clean energy 
transition, the role of infrastructure 
investment platforms is evolving – 
from being passive asset holders to 
becoming active participants in 
building the nation’s energy future. 
IndiGrid is uniquely positioned to 
contribute meaningfully to this shift – 
by mobilising capital efficiently, 
operating with accountability, and 
moving to adjacencies in the energy 
value chain.
What differentiates us is a solid 
financial platform, coupled with years 
of operational experience across 
geographical regions in the country. 
Our stakeholder relationships have 
helped us stay competitive and 
relevant with changing competitive 
environment. While we gradually 
transitioned to under construction in 
transmission over the past few years 
on the back of our hands-on team, 
being the pioneers in standalone 
BESS development has put us in good 
stead to capture the next set of 
opportunities in this space.
The key to our sustainable growth 
pursuit remains in us being integrated 
throughout the power value chain 
and mitigate risks with our onsite 
presence, a key to picking up 
challenges and addressing them 
ahead of time. Expansion with value 
creation continues to be our theme. 
We envisage that the national grid 
will not only grow at an unprecedented 
rate over the next decade but will 
integrate green energy faster across 
multiple use cases. 
There is enough and more opportunity  
to scale our portfolio through 
disciplined acquisitions and timely 
project commissioning. Through 
EnerGrid, we are creating greater 
visibility into our future growth 
pipeline by actively participating in 
the development of transmission and 
storage projects that align with the 
sector’s evolving needs. And above 
all, we remain committed to delivering 
stable, growing distributions 
underpinned by sound governance 
and a forward-looking strategy.
As we look to the future, we beckon 
your unwavering support for the next 
phase of our growth which has been 
a guiding light for our journey so far. 
We remain committed to creating 
more value for our unitholders, and 
making energy transition for the 
country more realizable and more 
affordable going forward.

Operational 
Maintenance Needs 
and End-of-Agreement 
Scenarios
Transmission 
Once a transmission project has been 
commissioned, it requires relatively 
low levels of expenditure to operate 
and maintain, which means that the 
InvIT will have the benefit of owning 
a critical asset without incurring 
significant operational costs, leading 
to a superior EBITDA profile of over 
~90%. 
The asset is eligible for 100% of its tariff 
as long as the transmission line has 
been available for 98% of the time 
period. 
In terms of the technical life, a 
transmission asset enjoys a longer 
asset life of ~50 years as compared 
to other infrastructure projects. 
The transmission lines of IndiGrid’s 
portfolio assets are predominantly 
located in areas where developing 
alternate lines may be challenging 
due to the terrain, challenges in 
obtaining rights of way, limited 
corridors and high construction 
costs. This puts IndiGrid in an 
advantageous position to capitalise 
on the opportunities to increase our 
power transmission capacity through 
the same corridor by upgrading our 
existing systems. 
Solar 
Solar power projects offer stable 
long-term cash flows backed by 
Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) 
with creditworthy off-takers. These 
contracts typically span 20–25 
years, ensuring predictable revenue 
visibility. After commissioning, solar 
assets have relatively low operating 
costs, with minimal fuel or variable 
input dependencies. This supports a 
robust EBITDA margin of ~80–85%.
The technical life of a solar project 
is typically ~25 years, with potential 
to extend through repowering or 
technical upgrades. IndiGrid’s solar 
assets are strategically located in 
high solar irradiance zones, enabling 
efficient generation. With growing 
grid-integration of renewables and 
supportive policy mechanisms. 
IndiGrid is well-positioned to benefit 
from long-term tailwinds in the 
renewable energy sector.
Battery Energy Storage Systems 
Battery Energy Storage Systems 
(BESS) are emerging as a vital 
enabler of grid stability, renewable 
integration, and peak demand 
management. All of IndiGrid’s BESS 
projects have secured 12-year Battery 
Energy Storage Purchase Agreements 
(BESPAs) with utilities, under which 
the tariff is pre-determined at the 
time of bidding and is payable as 
long as the system remains available 
for use by the off-taker – following 
a structure similar to transmission 
service agreements.
While actual long-term O&M lifecycle 
benchmarks are still evolving due to 
the nascent nature of the technology, 
BESS projects generally require 
relatively low maintenance, hence 
translating into an anticipated 
superior EBITDA profile of ~90%. 
The typical technical life of a BESS 
asset is ~15 years, with potential for 
system augmentation. IndiGrid’s 
assets are strategically located to 
cater to high-demand urban centres, 
providing strong value potential 
through grid services, policy-
backed revenue security, and future 
expansion optionality.

Economic Updates and Outlook
Global Economy
The global economy is gradually 
stabilising, continuing the slow 
recovery with major economies 
managing a soft landing after a 
period of policy tightening. Growth 
momentum has remained moderate 
but resilient, supported by improving 
financial conditions, easing supply 
constraints, and a rebound in cross-
border trade and investment.
Global output is projected to expand 
by around 3.1% in 2026, slightly 
below the pre-pandemic average 
but indicative of a more balanced 
and sustained recovery. Advanced 
economies are growing at a slower 
yet stable pace, with aggregate 
expansion estimated at 1.6%. In 
the United States, steady labour-
market strength and targeted fiscal 
measures are expected to support 
growth of 2.0%, even as inflation 
stays marginally above the target 
range. The Euro Area is projected to 
expand by 1.2%, driven by modest 
improvements in external demand, 
with Germany and France growing 
by 0.9% and 1.0%, respectively. Japan 
is expected to post 0.5% growth, 
constrained by demographic

Source
pressures, while the United Kingdom 
and Canada are anticipated 
to record moderate recoveries, 
reflecting normalised consumption 
and investment trends.
Among emerging and developing 
economies, growth remains the key 
driver of global expansion, projected 
at 4.0%. India continues to lead with an 
expected growth of 6.4%, supported 
by robust domestic demand, policy-
led infrastructure investments, 
and a strong manufacturing push. 
China is projected to grow by 4.2%, 
aided by export resilience and credit 
easing. Growth across the ASEAN-5 
economies is expected to remain firm, 
buoyed by regional trade recovery 
and supply-chain diversification. 
Elsewhere, Sub-Saharan Africa is 
anticipated to expand by 4.3%, the 
Middle East and Central Asia by 3.5%, 
Latin America and the Caribbean by 
2.4%, and emerging and developing 
Europe by 2.2%.
Global inflation is expected to ease 
further to 3.6% in 2026, supported by 
stabilising energy and commodity 
prices, improved supply dynamics, 
and sustained monetary discipline. 
While advanced economies are 
approaching their inflation targets, 
several emerging markets continue 
to face elevated food and fuel prices. 
Central banks are likely to maintain 
a cautious policy stance—balancing 
growth support with price stability—
until inflation expectations are firmly 
anchored.
Outlook
Looking ahead, the global economic 
outlook remains cautiously 
optimistic, though risks persist. Key 
downside factors include renewed 
geopolitical tensions, persistent 
trade fragmentation, sovereign-
debt vulnerabilities in developing 
economies, and climate-related 
disruptions that could affect supply 
chains and commodity markets. 
Conversely, successful trade 
negotiations, progress in structural 
reforms, and calibrated fiscal and 
monetary actions could reinforce 
global growth prospects. Overall, 
the world economy appears to 
be entering a phase of measured 
consolidation, marked by resilience, 
policy prudence, and a gradual 
strengthening of macroeconomic 
fundamentals.

Indian Economy
India’s economy continued to demonstrate strong momentum in FY 2024-25, 
remaining the world’s fastest-growing major economy. The Reserve Bank of India 
(RBI) recently revised its GDP growth forecast upwards to 6.8% in FY 2025-26, 
reflecting robust domestic fundamentals, improved macroeconomic stability, 
and a resilient policy environment that has effectively cushioned the impact of 
global trade disruptions.
Supported by steady consumption demand, rural recovery, and healthy 
investment activity, the Indian economy is consolidating its pre-pandemic 
growth trajectory. Favourable monsoon conditions, declining inflation, and stable 
crude oil prices (USD 65–70 per barrel) have strengthened purchasing power and 
improved household sentiment. Lower input costs and moderating interest rates 
are also expected to spur private investment through the second half of the year.

India’s ongoing infrastructure expansion continues to act as a catalyst for 
broader economic growth. Public capital expenditure by the Central and State 
Governments rose over 50% year-on-year in the first two months of FY 2025-26, 
reaffirming policy continuity towards long-term capacity building.
Meanwhile, services exports, accounting for nearly 47% of total exports, are 
providing a stable buffer against goods trade volatility amid global tariff 
realignments. Healthy external markers of current account deficit near 1% of 
GDP and foreign exchange reserves exceeding USD 700 Billion, further reinforce 
macroeconomic strength.
Outlook
The outlook for FY 2025–26 remains 
positive, supported by resilient 
domestic demand, moderating 
inflation, and policy tailwinds. 
According to CRISIL and the World 
Bank, India’s GDP is expected to grow 
between 6.5% and 6.8%, maintaining 
its global growth leadership. Over 
the medium term, growth will be 
driven by infrastructure investment, 
manufacturing expansion under the 
‘Make in India’ and PLI schemes, and 
an accelerated push towards the 
energy transition.
To sustain this momentum, continued 
focus on structural reforms, regulatory 
simplification, and technology 
adoption will be critical to enhancing 
productivity, attracting long-term 
investment, and strengthening India’s 
ability to navigate an evolving global 
economic landscape.

Powering Sustainable Growth:  
Industry Overview
Electricity: The 
Catalyst of Modern 
Economic Growth
India has achieved remarkable 
progress in fortifying its energy 
ecosystem in recent years, adeptly 
harmonising the imperatives of 
accelerating electricity demand 
and advancing environmental 
sustainability. As highlighted by the 
International Energy Agency (IEA), 
emerging and developing economies 
are poised to contribute nearly 85% 
of the global surge in electricity 
demand over the next three years, 
with India emerging as a linchpin 
in this transformation. Propelled by 
robust and sustained economic 
expansion, India is expected to 
witness the fastest growth in 
energy consumption among 
major economies. Consequently, 
its share in global primary energy 
use is projected to double by 2035, 
reflecting the nation’s pivotal role in 
steering the global energy transition.
Amid this transformation, electricity 
stands at the heart of India’s growth 
narrative, serving as the cornerstone 
of modern development. It powers 
industries, drives digital infrastructure, 
and enhances social well-being. 
By fuelling productivity, fostering 
innovation, and improving the quality 
of life across households, enterprises, 
and communities, electricity forms 
the vital link connecting India’s 
economic ambitions with its 
sustainability goals.
In India, electricity demand grew 
by 1.4% year-on-year in the first 
half of 2025, shaped by global 
economic uncertainties affecting 
industrial activity and cooler summer 
temperatures compared to 2024. The 
International Energy Agency (IEA) 
expects demand to pick up in the 
second half, bringing the full-year 
growth to around 4%, slightly slower 
than in 2024 due to milder weather. 
Looking further ahead, India’s 
electricity demand is projected to 
expand at an annual rate of roughly 
6.3–6.6% between 2025 and 2027. 
This acceleration will be driven 
by stronger industrial and service 
sector activity, rising incomes, and 
deeper penetration of appliances 
such as air conditioners, with growth 
particularly pronounced in residential 
and commercial segments as 
consumption patterns evolve.
The multiplier effect of power-
led infrastructure on the broader 
economy is significant. While sector-
specific multipliers for electricity are 
not officially published, infrastructure-
wide estimates often cited in policy 
discourse indicate a ~2.5–3.5x GDP 
multiplier, reflecting strong forward 
and backward linkages across 
construction, steel, cement, logistics, 
and technology. This underscores the 
strategic importance of sustained 
investments across generation, 
transmission, and distribution to 
meet rising demand and strengthen 
long-term energy security.
India’s Power 
Sector Framework
India’s power sector stands out as 
one of the most diversified globally, 
harnessing a wide array of energy 
sources. Traditional fuels such as 
coal, lignite, natural gas, oil, hydro, 
and nuclear coexist with renewable 
and alternative resources, including 
wind, solar, agricultural residues, and 
municipal waste. The sector is in the 
midst of a profound transformation, 
driven by four key pillars: 
Decarbonisation, Decentralisation, 
Digitalisation, and Democratisation.

These fundamental changes are 
reshaping the way India produces, 
transmits, and utilises electricity, 
paving the way for a cleaner, more 
intelligent, and inclusive energy 
ecosystem.
The sector is organised into three core 
segments: generation, transmission, 
and distribution.
 Generation entails the production 
of electricity at power plants 
using various energy inputs and 
technologies
 Transmission involves the 
high-voltage conveyance of 
bulk electricity from generation 
facilities to distribution substations 
via the national grid
 Distribution: represents the final 
stage, channelling electricity 
from substations to end users 
through lower-voltage networks, 
functioning as the retail interface 
that delivers power directly to 
households, businesses, and 
communities
The entire framework operates under 
the supervision of both Central and 
State regulators and is continually 
strengthened by progressive policies. 
These reforms aim to enhance 
efficiency, promote transparency, 
attract private investment, and 
support a more resilient and future-
ready electricity ecosystem.
Currently, India’s power sector 
is undergoing a profound 
transformation guided by four 
key pillars: Decarbonisation, 
Decentralisation, Digitalisation, and 
Democratisation. These structural 
shifts are redefining how electricity 
is produced, transmitted, and 
consumed, setting the stage for a 
cleaner, smarter, and more inclusive 
energy ecosystem.

*RES: Renewable energy sources comprise solar, wind, small hydro, and biomass, among others.
As of September 30, 2025, India’s total installed power generation capacity has 
reached over 500 GW, with non-fossil fuel sources contributing 256 GW, or 51.1% 
of the total, achieving the clean energy milestone five years ahead of the target 
set under its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement. 
This includes 247.3 GW from renewable sources and 8.8 GW from nuclear power, 
while the remaining 244.8 GW comes from thermal generation. 
This landmark achievement highlights India’s strong commitment to climate 
action and sustainable development and sets a global benchmark for clean 
energy growth. It reflects a rapidly accelerating transition towards green energy, 
showing that the country’s move away from fossil fuels is both substantial and on 
a forward-looking trajectory.
Despite this increase, India’s peak 
power demand for the summer fell 
short of earlier projections. Estimates 
for summer 2025 had anticipated a 
peak of 277 GW, but the actual record 
peak occurred at 242.77 GW in June. 
In comparison, the highest supply 
met in August was 229.71 GW, up from 
216.47 GW in August 2024, yet still 
below the all-time high of 250 GW 
recorded in May 2024. The moderation 
in demand relative to projections was 
largely influenced by above-average 
monsoon rainfall, which tempered 
electricity consumption across the 
country.
The Central Electricity Authority 
(CEA) and NEP 2024–47 project that 
India’s peak electricity demand could 
surge to 817 GW by 2047, more than 
three times current levels. Meeting 
this soaring demand necessitates 
a transformative overhaul across 
the entire power ecosystem - from 
generation to transmission and 
distribution. This includes accelerated 
deployment of renewable energy, 
advanced energy storage solutions, 
smart grid technologies, and 
comprehensive modernisation of 
transmission networks to ensure a 
resilient, flexible, and future-ready 
electricity infrastructure.

Power Generation: Greening the 
Grid with Depth and Discipline
India’s total power generation 
reached 799 Billion units (BU) in 
August 2025, reflecting a mix that 
is both diverse and evolving. Coal 
remained the dominant source, 
contributing 539.33 BU or 67.5% of the 
total output. Despite a growing focus 
on cleaner energy, coal continues 
to underpin the electricity system, 
providing steady and dependable 
baseload power. Its dominance 
highlights the ongoing challenge 
of balancing energy security with 
environmental sustainability.
Power from oil and gas accounted 
for 13.57 BU, or 1.7%, playing a niche 
role in meeting peak demand and 
supporting grid stability, though its 
expansion is limited by high fuel 
costs and constrained domestic 
supply. Nuclear energy added 23.2 
BU, or 2.9%, offering a reliable, low-
carbon alternative that diversifies the 
energy mix. Its contribution is modest 
but strategic, with future growth 
expected as new capacity comes 
online.
Renewables are making an 
increasingly noticeable impact, 
collectively contributing around 
28% of total generation. Hydro 
power generated 84.84 BU, or 10.6%, 
providing crucial flexibility for peak 
loads and seasonal variability. Wind 
power contributed 60.65 BU, or 
7.6%, remaining an essential pillar 
of clean energy production. Solar 
energy reached 67.81 BU, or 8.5%, 
reflecting rapid capacity additions 
and the success of policy initiatives. 
Smaller contributions came from 
biopower (4.75 BU; 0.6%) and small 
hydro (4.86 BU; 0.6%), which play a 
vital role in decentralised and rural 
electrification.
Overall, thermal sources, including 
coal, oil, and gas accounted for 
roughly 69% of total generation, 
renewables about 28%, and nuclear 
energy 3%. The pattern indicates 
a steady transition: while coal 
continues to anchor the system, 
renewable energy is steadily gaining 
ground. Solar and wind growth 
reflects technological progress, 
supportive policies, and declining 
costs, positioning India as a global 
leader in clean energy adoption.
This generation profile underscores 
a transformative phase in India’s 
energy sector. Efforts to modernise 
the grid, integrate storage 
solutions, and enhance flexibility in 
conventional plants will be key to 
accommodating rising renewable 
shares while ensuring a reliable and 
resilient electricity supply.
The Indian Government has rolled 
out a series of strategic initiatives to 
accelerate power generation and 
drive the energy transition. Central 
to these efforts is the expansion of 
renewable energy capacity, with 
a target of 500 GW of non-fossil 
fuel power by 2030, backed by 
programmes such as the Production-
Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes for 
solar modules, battery storage, and 
green hydrogen.
In parallel, nuclear energy is slated 
to reach 100 GW by 2047, supported 
by significant investments in Small 
Modular Reactors (SMRs). The 
government is also focussing on rural 
electrification, grid modernisation, 
and distribution reforms to enhance 
efficiency, reliability, and accessibility 
across the country.
Outlook
India’s power sector is entering 
a growth-oriented phase, driven 
by a major shift towards non-
fossil fuel sources, targeting 
500 GW of renewable capacity by 
2030. Reducing crude oil import 
dependency, currently around 85%, 
remains a strategic priority, with 
incentives for domestic exploration, 
biofuels, and hydrogen. Renewables, 
energy storage, and green hydrogen 
are expected to expand further 
through industrial and international 
collaborations, though demand-side 
challenges must be addressed.
Coal continues to anchor the energy 
mix, while nuclear energy, including 
Bharat Small Reactors (BSRs), is 
emerging as a low-carbon option. 
Oil and gas dynamics, influenced by 
global supply constraints and US LNG 
exports, are shaping India’s energy 
strategy, including plans for one 
Million barrels per day of new refining 
capacity by 2030.
Technological adoption—AI, 
digitalisation, smart meters—will 
enhance efficiency and planning, 
while regulatory reforms, such as the 
Oilfields Regulation & Development 
Act (ORDA) and MoPNG initiatives, 
aim to strengthen energy security, 
governance, and investment ease.

Power Transmission: Strengthening 
the Backbone of Energy Security
India’s electricity transmission 
system forms the critical backbone 
of the nation’s power infrastructure, 
enabling the smooth flow of 
electricity from generation centres 
to consumers across vast distances. 
This network not only ensures reliable 
power supply but also plays a 
pivotal role in integrating renewable 
energy, maintaining grid stability, 
and meeting the growing electricity 
demand of both urban and rural 
areas. Continuous expansion and 
modernisation of transmission 
lines are key to supporting India’s 
economic growth and energy 
transition.
As per NITI Aayog, as of September 
2025, India’s transmission network 
spans a total of 4,96,372 circuit 
kilometres (cKM), reflecting the 
country’s extensive electricity 
infrastructure. Of this, central 
transmission lines account for 
1,86,322 cKM, forming the backbone 
for inter-state power transfer and 
ensuring reliable long-distance 
electricity flow. State transmission 
lines contribute 2,66,542 cKM, 
playing a critical role in distributing 
power within states and connecting 
regional generation sources to local 
demand centres. Joint venture and 
private transmission lines make 
up 43,508 cKM, highlighting the 
increasing participation of private 
and collaborative ventures in 
strengthening the grid. This expansive 
network supports efficient power 
delivery across India, enabling grid 
stability, integration of renewable 
energy, and meeting the rising 
electricity demand of both urban and 
rural areas.
During the first half of  
FY 2025–26, additional capacity 
was commissioned across major 
Renewable Energy Zones (REZs) 
in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, 
Maharashtra, and Karnataka, 
with multiple 400 kV and 765 kV 
corridors under implementation. The 
network composition continues to 
be dominated by 400 kV and 220 kV 
systems, while High-Voltage Direct 
Current (HVDC) corridors of ±800 kV 
and ±500 kV are gaining strategic 
importance for long-distance, high-
efficiency power transfer, particularly 
for renewable evacuation from 
Western clusters.
Technological modernisation 
also advanced during the period. 
Deployment of Phasor Measurement 
Units (PMUs), Wide-Area Monitoring 
Systems (WAMS), and control-centre 
upgrades under CTUIL/POWERGRID 
programmes enhanced grid visibility, 
operational resilience, and real-time 
fault diagnostics.
Private sector participation through 
the TBCB mechanism remained 
strong in H1 FY 2025-26. Entities such 
as POWERGRID and Adani Energy 
Solutions secured or progressed 
multiple inter-state transmission 
projects through competitive 
bidding, reflecting sustained investor 
confidence in the sector.
A major milestone was the 
commissioning of IndiGrid’s 20 MW/40 
MWh standalone Battery Energy 
Storage System (BESS) at Kilokari, 
Delhi, in April 2025, with regulator-
approved tariff. This marks India’s first 
regulated, utility-scale, standalone 
storage asset, providing frequency 
support, congestion management, 
and grid stability at the distribution 
interface.

Power Distribution: Enabling Last-Mile 
Delivery and Reform
India’s power distribution sector 
is steadily evolving, moving from 
a historically loss-heavy and 
infrastructure-limited system to a 
digitally enabled, performance-
driven, and customer-focused 
network. With universal household 
electrification achieved and 
renewable energy increasingly 
integrated, the sector serves as the 
crucial last-mile link in the electricity 
value chain, ensuring reliable 
supply, operational efficiency, and 
financial stability. Challenges like 
high distribution losses, power theft, 
and stressed utility finances persist, 
but the creation of a unified National 
Grid - connecting regional networks 
through advanced transmission 
technology - enables smooth 
electricity transfer from surplus to 
deficit areas, strengthening both 
reliability and India’s clean energy 
transition.
The sector’s financial performance 
showed continued improvement 
entering FY 2025–26. As of mid-2025, 
aggregate technical and commercial 
(AT&C) losses had declined from 
21.91% in FY 2020-21 to 16.12% in FY 
2023-24, while the Average Cost 
of Supply (ACS)–Average Revenue 
Realised (ARR) gap narrowed from 
INR 0.69/kWh in FY 2020-21 to INR 
0.19/kWh in FY 2023-24. These figures 
reflect better billing efficiency, 
improved subsidy disbursement, 
and stronger collection performance 
under reform-linked programmes. 
The reliability of power supply also 
strengthened. The Ministry of Power’s 
annual review placed urban hours 
of supply (HoS) at 23.53 hours/day, 
while government communication 
cited urban supply at around 23.4 
hours/day and rural supply at about 
22.6 hours/day in 2025, indicative of 
near-universal access and improved 
service delivery.
Reforms under the Revamped 
Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) 
continued to drive structural 
improvements. The programme, 
with a total outlay of INR 3,03,758 
Crore from FY 2021–22 to  
FY 2025–26, remains the cornerstone 
for loss reduction, ACS–ARR gap 
narrowing, and quality-of-supply 
enhancement. RDSS is results-linked, 
with funding tied to measurable 
performance metrics, reinforcing 
accountability across utilities. 
Digitalisation also remained central 
to the transformation agenda. Under 
RDSS, 20.33 Crore smart meters were 
sanctioned, of which 2.41 Crore were 
installed as of July 15, 2025, according 
to official data. The National Smart 
Grid Mission dashboard, updated on 
September 30, 2025, provides state-
wise progress snapshots. Deployment 
of smart meters, advanced metering 
infrastructure (AMI), and digital 
billing systems is expected to further 
enhance transparency and loss 
monitoring.
The sector also saw progress in 
rooftop integration and bidirectional 
energy flows through the PM Surya 
Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana, which has a 
total outlay of INR 75,021 Crore and 
achieved 10.09 Lakhs rooftop solar 
installations by March 10, 2025. This 
initiative is driving household-level 
solar adoption and enabling net 
metering at scale. Financial discipline 
and transparency improved through 
continued enforcement of the 
Electricity (Late Payment Surcharge 
and Related Matters) Rules, 2022, 
along with the 2024 amendments 
issued by the Ministry of Power. In 
parallel, the Electricity Distribution 
(Accounts and Additional Disclosure) 
Rules, 2024 introduced enhanced 
accounting and provisioning 
standards, strengthening fiscal 
accountability and lender confidence.
The 13 th Integrated Rating and 
Ranking Report (July 2025) by PFC 
India reflected continued operational 
improvement, with 40 of 63 DISCOMs 
reporting reduced AT&C losses in FY 
2023–24 and visible progress on cost 
recovery and financial parameters. 
On-ground modernisation during the 
first half of FY 2025–26 included feeder 
modernisation, GIS substations, 
underground cabling, transformer 
upgrades, and loss-reduction works 
under RDSS. These projects are 
enhancing supply reliability and 
preparing networks for rooftop solar, 
EV charging, and distributed storage 
integration.
Despite progress, challenges persist. 
Resistance to prepaid metering and 
tariff rationalisation in some States 
continues to delay uniform adoption 
of reforms. Utilities also face the 
ongoing task of integrating legacy IT 
and operational systems to handle 
growing volumes of AMI data and 
two-way power flows. Cybersecurity 
frameworks for distribution networks 
remain under evolution, with utilities 
expected to follow established 
internal protocols until national 
standards are formalised.
Outlook
India’s power distribution sector is 
witnessing rapid and transformative 
growth, driven by the twin goals of 
meeting rising electricity demand 
and enhancing supply reliability. 
Ongoing reforms emphasise reducing 
technical and commercial losses, 
strengthening the financial health of 
DISCOMs, and modernising networks 
through smart grid technologies. The 
government’s Revamped Distribution 
Sector Scheme (RDSS) is accelerating 
this transition by promoting smart 
metering, loss reduction, and 
improved service quality. Meanwhile, 
proposed legislative changes aim to 
liberalise the market, encouraging 
private sector participation and 
fostering competition and innovation. 
With digitalisation and grid 
modernisation at its core, the sector 
is pivotal to integrating renewable 
energy and advancing India’s clean 
energy transition towards a more 
resilient and sustainable power 
system by 2030 and beyond.

Policies and Government Initiatives
India’s Energy Transition 
India’s energy transition is underpinned by a comprehensive and evolving policy framework that aims to simultaneously 
address energy access, affordability, security, and sustainability. Through a series of well-orchestrated central schemes, 
fiscal incentives, regulatory reforms, and market mechanisms, the government has laid a robust foundation to accelerate 
investments across the power value chain.
Clean Energy Expansion and 
Renewable Integration
India has set an ambitious target of 
achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel 
generated power capacity by 2030. 
This goal is aligned with the nation’s 
pledge to cut the emission intensity of 
its GDP by 45% from 2005 levels and 
attain Net Zero targets by 2070. To 
support this goal, the government has 
institutionalised multiple programmes: 
 Green Energy Corridor (GEC): 
Facilitates evacuation of renewable 
power from generation zones to 
demand centres. In 2024-25 alone, 
INR 6 Billion was allocated to expand 
transmission lines and substations 
under GEC-II and GEC-III 
 Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) 
Scheme: Originally targeted 50 
GWh of advanced-chemistry-
cell (ACC) manufacturing with 
an outlay of INR 18,100 Crore. 
By mid-2025, the scheme was 
under reassessment as several 
beneficiaries—including Ola 
Electric, Reliance New Energy, 
and Rajesh Exports—missed 
commissioning milestones and 
sought deadline extensions
 Renewable Energy Zones (REZs): 
Created in high-potential regions 
like Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Tamil 
Nadu, with expedited clearances 
and viability gap funding (VGF) to 
ensure timely infrastructure rollouts  
 VGF: Approved for offshore wind 
projects totalling 1,000 MW, further 
diversifying the renewable mix
Energy Storage and Grid 
Modernisation 
Recognising energy storage as 
a critical enabler of firm and 
dispatchable renewable power, the 
government introduced multiple 
mandates and incentives:
 Energy Storage Obligation (ESO): 
Requires discoms and load serving 
entities to procure a minimum 
share of stored energy, scaling 
from 1% in FY 2023-24 to 4% by FY 
2029-30, with 85% to be derived 
from renewables 
 BESS Mandate: MoP guidelines 
issued in February 2025 require 
a minimum of 2-hour storage to 
be co-located with 10% of solar 
capacity in all new bids 
 Financial Support: SECI’s SIGHT-II 
programme awarded INR 22.39 
Billion in incentives to 3 GW of green 
hydrogen and electrolyser capacity 
Distribution Sector Reforms 
and Subsidy Rationalisation
 Revamped Distribution Sector 
Scheme (RDSS): With a total outlay 
of INR 3.04 Trillion, the scheme 
targets AT&C loss reduction to  
12-15% and aims to close the ACS-
ARR gap
 Electricity Rules (Rights of 
Consumers): Enhances service 
accountability with compensation 
frameworks, minimum supply hours, 
and billing transparency norms 
 ISTS Charge Waiver Extension 
(June 2025): The Ministry of Power 
extended the 100% waiver of 
inter-state-transmission-system 
(ISTS) charges to include co-
located battery energy storage 
systems (BESS) and pumped-
storage hydropower projects 
commissioned by June 30, 2028, 
broadening the earlier exemption 
for solar/wind projects 
 VGF for BESS Capacity: The 
government announced INR 9,100 
Crore of VGF support for 43.2 GWh 
of battery-storage projects, further 
reinforcing policy focus on grid 
flexibility. 
 Grid Intelligence: Investments 
through RDSS and IPDS support 
SCADA, AMI, WAMS, and DMS 
technologies to enhance grid 
responsiveness
 Electricity Distribution (Accounts 
and Additional Disclosure) Rules, 
2024: Mandates provisioning for 
receivables, quarterly disclosures, 
and improved subsidy accounting 
 Late Payment Surcharge (LPSC) 
Mechanism: Provides structured 
EMI-based frameworks to clear 
legacy dues of discoms, lowering 
payment risks for generators and 
transmission licensees

Outlook
India’s power sector policy 
architecture is gradually shifting 
from asset creation to system 
integration. With robust push 
towards clean technology 
manufacturing, grid digitisation, 
financial reform, and regional 
cooperation, India is laying the 
groundwork for an efficient, resilient, 
and green energy ecosystem. The 
alignment of sectoral policies with 
broader macro goals like energy 
security, employment generation, 
and climate leadership will 
continue to attract domestic and 
global capital, while ensuring long-
term sectoral viability.
Hydrogen, Decarbonisation, 
and Critical Minerals 
Strategy
 National Green Hydrogen Mission: 
Aims to achieve 5 Million metric 
tonnes of annual green hydrogen 
production by 2030. As of FY 
2024–25, India has sanctioned 
over 862,000 tonnes per annum 
of production capacity and 3 GW 
of electrolyser manufacturing 
projects under the mission
 Fiscal Incentives: The Union 
Budget 2025–26 has earmarked 
INR 600 Crore to support pilot 
projects and decentralised green 
hydrogen applications, fostering 
early adoption and innovation
 Critical Minerals Mission: With an 
approved outlay of INR 163 Billion, 
the mission promotes exploration, 
processing, and recycling of 
essential minerals such as lithium 
and cobalt, complemented by 
duty exemptions on cobalt powder 
and lithium-ion battery scrap to 
strengthen India’s clean energy 
supply chain
Private Sector Enablement 
and Market Reforms
 Tariff-Based Competitive Bidding 
(TBCB): Continues to be the 
dominant route for awarding ISTS 
projects, fostering transparency 
and efficiency 
 Real-Time Market (RTM) and 
Green Day-Ahead Market 
(GDAM): Operationalised to allow 
renewable generators greater 
scheduling flexibility and access to 
markets
 Regulatory Simplification: 
Streamlined processes for 
open access, net metering, and 
captive generation are helping 
debottleneck private participation
 Complementary Storage Policies: 
Recent ISTS charge waivers and 
ESS asset recognition collectively 
strengthen the market framework 
for storage-linked renewable 
participation

Cross-Border and Regional 
Energy Trade
The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) 
and Ministry of Power are actively 
promoting regional cooperation with 
neighbouring countries. Cross-border 
trade guidelines have been updated 
to support seasonal balancing, surplus 
renewable export, and harmonised 
grid planning with Nepal, Bhutan, 
Bangladesh, and Myanmar. India’s 
cross-border transmission capacity 
stood at ~13,998 MW in early 2025.

Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs): 
Catalysing Capital for India’s  
Infrastructure Needs
InvITs have firmly established 
themselves as a key enabler of 
infrastructure financing in India. As 
of September 30, 2025, there were 26 
InvITs registered with SEBI, spanning 
sectors such as roads, power 
transmission, renewable energy, 
telecom towers, and logistics. Among 
these, 5 are publicly listed and rest 
are privately placed. 
Collectively, InvITs manage assets 
worth approximately INR 6 Lakh 
Crore and have raised INR 1.2 Lakh 
Crore in equity since 2019. The five 
publicly listed InvITs now command 
a combined market capitalisation of 
approximately INR 30,500 Crore and 
serve over 2.4 Lakh unitholders. This 
reflects growing interest from both 
institutional and retail investors.
Regulatory support has been 
instrumental in nurturing this 
asset class. SEBI introduced key 
amendments to improve liquidity 
and flexibility in FY 2024-25, easing 
lock-in requirements for preferential 
allotments and permitting inter se 
transfer of locked-in units among 
sponsors and their group entities. In 
addition, new guidelines for follow-
on public offers were issued to 
streamline fundraising and enable 
fast-track issuance. Complementary 
policy reforms such as the inclusion 
of InvITs in the investment mandates 
of insurance companies, pension 
funds, and foreign portfolio investors 
(FPIs), along with the reduction of the 
minimum trading lot size to one unit, 
have enhanced market accessibility 
and deepened participation.
From an operational perspective, 
InvITs like IndiGrid exemplify how 
the model enables scalable asset 
ownership and efficient capital 
recycling. IndiGrid, India’s largest  
listed power sector InvIT, has 
expanded its Assets Under 
Management (AUM) to around INR 
296 Billion through a combination 
of acquisitions and greenfield 
investments spanning transmission, 
solar, and battery energy storage. 
This performance underscores the 
increasing investor appetite for long-
duration, annuity-like cash flows 
supported by critical infrastructure 
assets. With a regulatory requirement 
to distribute at least 90% of Net 
Distributable Cash Flows (NDCF) to 
unitholders, InvITs continue to offer 
attractive, stable yields.
Looking ahead, InvITs are maturing 
into mainstream financing platforms 
for infrastructure, anchored by clear 
regulations, improving operational 
performance, and increasing 
institutional interest. Their role is 
expected to expand further with the 
rising private sector participation, 
particularly in the context of the 
National Monetisation Pipeline and 
India’s accelerating energy transition.

Focus on Maximising ‘Reliability’
In accordance with the Assured 
Performance pillar of the Asset 
Management Framework, 
predictable reliability is of paramount 
importance to achieve committed 
performance for our stakeholders. 
IndiGrid has adopted the Reliability-
Reliability depends upon predictability, 
and predictability is achieved through 
the right methods and tools.
The traditional approach to routine 
maintenance works for easily 
detectable, low-risk issues that 
are addressed on a periodic basis. 
While this largely fulfils the statutory 
requirements, this approach is less 
effective for an efficient and reliable 
asset performance.
IndiGrid has augmented traditional 
routine maintenance, with various 
predictive methodologies. This way 
it has moved from conventional 
corrective (or reactive or run to failure 
approach) to more effective predictive, 
preventive and reliability centred 
maintenance. 
Centered (RC) approach to achieve 
the objective of safe and reliable 
operations of assets. 
The RC approach is the process 
of determining the most effective 
maintenance strategies based 
on the local and global leading 
Implementation of technologies 
like drone-based inspection, use 
of AI-based image analytics, and 
investigative technologies such as TFR, 
electric field modelling, corona imaging, 
EFD/IR have helped significantly 
in taking timely interventions on 
transmission lines. Rigorous testing of 
our substation equipment involving 
regular DGA on oil-filled equipment, Tan 
Delta tests on bushings, windings, and 
CTs, regular CRM and DCRM tests on 
circuit breakers, and regular protection 
audits, among others, have yielded 
better reliability across our transmission 
portfolio. 
Further digitisation of asset 
management processes and 
implementation of tools like Maximo, 
Asset Health Index, and RAS have 
enhanced data integrity, response time 
practices across sectors, particularly 
in power transmission. The success 
of approach is well demonstrated by 
the consistent drop in the Trips/ Un-
scheduled outages and an increase 
in reliability over the past five years.
and monitoring of vital performance 
parameters with respect to the baseline, 
helping timely interventions.
Going forward, online technologies 
such as DGA instruments, SF6 leakage 
detection cameras, and a digital 
asset lifecycle management platform 
with artificial intelligence-based 
transformative technologies, along 
with robust emergency management 
programmes featuring an inbuilt state-
of-the-art SCADA system, will further 
strengthen IndiGrid’s RC approach to 
enable the Company to deliver its vision 
and objectives.
IndiGrid is accredited with IMS 
certification for ISO 9001, ISO 14000, ISO 
45000 quality and safety management 
systems, and ISO 27001 for the

Details of the continued key initiative and new reliability-centric projects undertaken during the year are detailed below:
Key Reliability Initiatives
Digital Transformation in 
Partnership with IBM
IndiGrid continues to use state of 
art Digigrid, an artificial intelligence 
(AI)-ready platform co-created with 
IBM for all its asset-management 
activities.
DigiGrid, together with IBM Maximo 
Application Suite, running on the 
secure AWS Cloud, enables IndiGrid 
to digitise all asset O&M data at 
the enterprise level, ensuring data 
Integrity while optimising the quality 
and utilising of IndiGrid’s assets 
throughout their lifecycle.
DigiGrid is live across all IndiGrid assets 
and is also integrated into the SAP 
ERP system. The key modules of Asset 
Master, Work Order Management 
for Preventive Inspection and Defect 
Correction, QHSE, Crew Management, 
Warehouse operations, Procurement 
and Service are completed and live. 
Additionally, with the implementation 
of the Asset Health Indexing (AHI) 
project, we have entered the 
next phase to provide insights for 
risk-based and life cycle-based 
maintenance strategies.
Asset Health Index
Asset Health Index (AHI) has been 
one of the most strategic projects 
at IndiGrid. Critical equipment 
undergoes a number of checks and 
tests during the year. In business, 
as usual, it is a herculean task to 
manually keep track of each test data 
for thousands of pieces of equipment 
across the portfolio.
Co-created, with M/s Laxmi 
Associates, a solution which is based 
on the globally renowned CIGRE, 
IEC and IEEE standards with end-
to-end integration with IndiGrid’s 
Maximo system as data input helps 
predict health of critical substation 
equipment.
Implementation of Drone and 
AI-based Analytics
IndiGrid has adopted periodic drone-
based patrolling of transmission lines. 
This method, using a high-resolution 
camera, helps conduct close-range 
observations and identify even 
the minutest defects. This enables 
system engineers to proactively plan 
and schedule maintenance and 
shutdowns while focussing on risk 
prioritisation.
As the next step, IndiGrid is 
developing, along with partners, 
artificial intelligence-based tools 
to analyse these images. The tools 
aim to recognise even the minutest 
defects and observations and record 
them through a Maximo work order. 
This will improve the productivity of 
engineers manyfold while enhancing 
data accuracy.
Central Monitoring System 
(BAX) for Solar Assets
Specialised central monitoring 
system (BAX platform), tailored for 
solar assets, is under implementation, 
a significant step supporting 
in IndiGrid’s ongoing digital 
transformation journey. This system 
aligns with the Asset Management 
Framework, enabling proactive 
monitoring and timely resolution of 
faults and breakdowns. It provides 
access to real-time data, allowing 
IndiGrid to harness the full potential 
of digital transformation for informed 
and swift decision-making.
01 03 05
02
Investigative Technologies
IndiGrid has adopted the use of 
various technologies such as leakage 
current detectors (LCD) and tower 
footing impedance, coronagraphy 
of insulators and hardware fittings, 
electric field modelling and 
detection, and infrared (IR) scanning 
of insulators to proactively detect 
ageing-related issues in insulators 
and tower earthing. This has enabled 
timely interventions and reduced 
insulator- or lightning-related trips 
across a number of assets.
04
06
Other Digital and Technology 
Initiatives
IndiGrid has invested heavily into 
creating a future-ready infrastructure. 
Several projects, including DMS, 
SAP implementation and SCADA 
upgradation have been undertaken 
to revamp and upgrade the existing 
infrastructure. IndiGrid has added 
an emergency restoration system 
to prepare itself better in case of 
emergency events.
It empowers IndiGrid to transition 
from a condition-based maintenance 
approach to a predictive maintenance 
stage, driven by its Reliability-Centred 
methodology. This transformation 
optimises the efficiency of its assets 
by mitigating equipment under 
performance and associated costs, 
while also generating valuable, data-
driven insights.
IndiGrid has implemented the WRENCH 
platform for efficient management of 
engineering documents, including 
drawings and technical specifications. 
The system ensures version control 
and triggers automated workflows 
for review and approval upon vendor 
submission, enhancing collaboration, 
traceability, and process efficiency 
across engineering functions.

Revenue, EBITDA 
and PAT
Revenue from operations grew by 
1.6% during H1 FY 2025-26 compared to 
H1 FY 2024-25, driven by the following 
factors:
Increase in revenue from the 
addition of two new assets and 
commencement of operations 
of two RTM projects, contributing 
approximately INR 930 Million in 
total. Notional revenue of around  
INR 790 Million recognised for one 
BOOT project in line with service 
concession accounting.
Prior period impact: H1 FY 2024-25 
included a one-time exceptional CIL 
claim in NER and KhTL amounting to 
INR 580 Million.
Offsetting factors: Gains were partially 
reduced due to non-operation of 
certain assets and the impact of a 
CERC true-up order on RTM projects, 
together amounting to INR 790 Million.
EBITDA declined by 4.7%, primarily 
due to revenue impacts noted above 
and notional accounting for the BOOT 
project, where expected margins are 
recorded over construction costs. 
Key cost components during the 
period included annual maintenance 
contracts, insurance, professional 
fees, and regulatory charges.
NDCF and DPU
Net Distributable Cash Flows (NDCF) 
is the free cash flow generated from 
underlying operations. Cash flows 
received by IndiGrid are typically in 
the form of interest income, dividend 
income, principal repayment, and 
other income. IndiGrid is required 
to distribute 90% of the cash flows 
received to its unitholders. During H1 
FY 2025-26, the NDCF was INR 6,491 M 
illion, a YoY growth of 2.6%. Distribution 
Per Unit (DPU) amounts to cash flows 
distributed on a ‘per unit’ basis to 
the unitholders. The trust distributed 
DPU of INR 8.0/unit in the period  
H1 FY 2025-26, in-line with the 
guidance of INR 16.00/unit for FY 2026.
Assets Under 
Management
As of September 30, 2025, IndiGrid’s 
Assets Under Management 
(AUM) stood at INR 325 Billion. 
The valuation was independently 
conducted by registered Valuer,  
Mr. S Sundararaman, reaffirming the 
scale, quality, and long-term earning 
potential of IndiGrid’s diversified 
asset base.

Internal Control Systems
IndiGrid has a strong internal control system to manage its 
operations, financial reporting, and compliance 
requirements.
The Investment Manager has clearly defined roles and 
responsibilities for all managerial positions. All the business 
parameters are regularly monitored, and effective steps 
are taken to control them. Regular internal audits are 
conducted to ensure that responsibilities are executed 
effectively. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors 
periodically reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of 
internal control systems and suggests improvements to 
further strengthen them.
Insurance
All transmission assets, substations and renewable assets 
are covered under Industrial All Risks (as against Standard 
Fire and Special Peril Insurance). This provides a broad 
coverage against fire and allied perils, burglary, accidental 
damage, asset breakdown as well as business interruption. 
IndiGrid has also made sure to cover its damage due to 
terrorism. Detailed insurance terms and conditions, 
exclusions, deductibles are mentioned in the respective 
policy contract.
All assets are insured to the extent of INR 2 Billion loss limit 
for standard risks like fire, storm, flood, tempest, machinery 
breakdown and related risks, including loss of profit. The 
policy is subject to standard exclusions. The coverage 
under policy has been extended for reinstatement of value, 
escalation, cost of architect, surveyors, and consulting 
engineers, removal of debris and other clauses. All 
substation assets are covered on a 100% replacement 
value basis, including business interruption. The substations 
assets are covered on a replacement value basis, including 
business interruption, through a separate Industrial All Risk 
policy. Sudden and accidental machinery breakdown and 
related business interruption are also covered. In addition, 
there is terrorism cover for all transmission assets with a 
loss limit of INR 4 Billion and CGL with a loss limit of  
INR 500 Million.
Outlook
Over the last 9 years, IndiGrid’s underlying performance 
has been robust, and it remains well capitalised to grow 
faster than ever before. Backed by marquee investors, 
IndiGrid intends to keep the momentum of growing the 
underlying portfolio as well as enhancing unitholder 
returns. On the operational front, it continues to make 
investments in industry leading technology initiatives to 
catapult digital asset management, predictive analytics 
and emergency preparedness and become self-reliant in 
project management, sustain, and further enhance 
operational efficiencies and synergies. IndiGrid’s main 
objective is to continue to ensure a positive impact on 
India’s power connectivity by providing reliable power, 
while delivering superior risk-adjusted returns to its 
unitholders. The management has provided guidance for 
an increased distribution of INR 16.00 per unit for 
FY 2025-26. IndiGrid remains confident in successfully 
meeting this guidance.

Materiality Assessment
As part of our ESG strategy, we undertook a comprehensive materiality assessment aligned with the GRI Framework 
to identify the most relevant sustainability topics impacting our operations and stakeholders. This assessment 
encompassed our core business activities, spanning solar power projects, transmission lines, substations, and battery 
energy storage system (BESS) projects, and involved benchmarking against industry peers, ESG standards, and investor 
expectations. Through structured stakeholder engagement, weighted scoring, and management reviews, we prioritised 
material topics across the Environment, Social, and Governance pillars. This process ensures that our ESG initiatives are 
focussed on areas of the highest significance, enabling resilient operations and long-term value creation.

risk transmission zones. Employees 
receive regular training to manage 
safety risks proactively.
  First Aid and Emergency Response 
Training are conducted periodically 
to build internal preparedness 
across locations.
 Critical Illness Support, though 
not formalised, we have extended 
financial and medical support to our

health challenges, demonstrating 
our values in action.
  Health Coverage and Insurance are 
standard across the organisation,

to the children of the Cerebral Palsy Association of India, 
Windsor Building.
What began as a simple call for donations turned into 
a heartwarming wave of generosity, with contributions 
pouring in not only from our Mumbai office but from across 
IndiGrid. Each item donated carried with it kindness, care, 
and the hope of making a difference.
Building the Next Wave of Women Leaders at IndiGrid
Overview
In H1 FY 2026, we conceptualised and initiated planning 
for a focused Women’s Leadership Programme to 
strengthen the leadership pipeline of women across the 
organisation. The programme officially commenced in 
April 2025 and is part of our continued commitment to 
gender diversity, equity, and inclusion. It is designed to 
enable women employees to confidently take on future 
leadership roles through a structured learning and 
development journey.
The Women’s Leadership Programme aims to empower 
and equip women employees with the skills, confidence, 
and exposure required to transition into leadership 
roles. 37 women from diverse regions and functional 
areas are participating in the initiative. The programme 
was structured into two developmental tracks:
  Rise Like a Woman 
  Lead Like a Woman
They are designed to cater to different stages of 
leadership readiness. They are delivered through 
a blended learning model that combines live 
masterclasses and digital modules. The initiative offers 
a flexible yet immersive learning experience. The content 
and facilitation were developed in collaboration with 
experienced external learning partners specialising in 
leadership development.
Case Study
The programme includes:
  Kick-off and Orientation: Immersive onboarding 
experience

leadership concepts and cross-functional visibility
  Enhance participants’ self-awareness, peer 
learning, and strategic communication skills
  Strengthening organisational culture of inclusion 
and leadership diversity
  Contribute to the long-term goal of enabling 
women to take leadership roles across the field 
and corporate functions

Our Approach
Planned Contribution to UN SDGs
Our approach to Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) is guided by 
our CSR Policy, which reflects our 
belief that sustainable development 
is fundamental to our business 
philosophy. We are committed to 
achieving ‘Zero Harm’ to people, the 
environment, and the communities 
around us. Aligned with our ESG 
strategy, our CSR efforts aim to 
balance operational excellence with 
environmental responsibility, while 
fostering inclusive and long-term 
growth for the communities where 
we operate.
Beyond the scope of CSR 
interventions, ESG personnel actively 
conduct community awareness 
sessions aimed at enhancing local 
understanding of biodiversity 
conservation. These sessions focus 
on educating communities about 
the IUCN Red List and endangered 
species identified within the vicinity of 
project areas. By fostering awareness 
on the ecological significance of 
these species and the importance 
of preserving local habitats, IndiGrid 
aims to promote responsible 
environmental stewardship 
and community participation in 
biodiversity conservation efforts.

and SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), 
aiming to uplift the standard of living 
in underserved rural communities.
04
Women Empowerment
 Vocational Training for Women

tribal girls this Financial Year with 
areas identified near IndiGrid assets.
Together, these efforts contribute 
to economic inclusion and social 
upliftment, aligned with SDG 5 
(Gender Equality) and SDG 8 (Decent 
Work and Economic Growth).
03
Promoting  
Education
To enhance the quality of life in rural 
and peri-urban areas, IndiGrid is 
committed to strengthening access 
to quality education through the 
digitisation and upgradation of 
educational units. This initiative 
focuses on equipping schools with 
digital infrastructure, learning tools, 
and modern teaching aids to foster 
interactive and technology-enabled 
learning environments.
By bridging the digital divide, the 
programme aims to empower 
students and teachers, improve 
learning outcomes, and ensure that 
children in underserved communities 
have access to the same quality of 
education.

Green Initiatives
To support environmental 
regeneration and sustainable urban 
development, we invested in green 
infrastructure by:
Strengthening of Tiger corridors 
in areas identified for its high 
biodiversity potential and high tiger 
movement.
These nature-based solutions 
enhanced urban green cover, 
supported local biodiversity, and 
offered long-term community and 
environmental benefits.
These interventions contribute 
to SDG 15 (Life on Land) and 
SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and 
Communities).

frontline and junior employees.
DigiGrid and Asset Health Index (AHI)
Our DigiGrid platform is an integrated digital 
asset management system deployed across our 
portfolio. It enables real-time asset performance 
monitoring through advanced data acquisition and 
analytics tools. DigiGrid aggregates operational 
data from multiple sources, providing a centralised 
dashboard for asset condition visibility. This platform 
supports remote diagnostics, automated alerts, and  
data-driven decision-making, facilitating a shift from 
traditional reactive maintenance to a predictive and 
preventive maintenance model.
A key feature of DigiGrid is the Asset Health Index 
(AHI), an advanced analytical metric designed 
to quantify asset condition through rigorous data 
integration and analysis. The AHI consolidates multiple 
condition indicators, including dielectric, thermal 
core, mechanical, and bushing scores, into a single, 
unified score ranging from 1 (poor condition) to  
Case Study
5 (optimal health). Each indicator is weighted based 
on its impact on asset reliability.
The AHI calculation incorporates data from 
manufacturer specifications, field inspections, test 
results, and historical performance, adjusted by a data 
availability coefficient. This ensures high accuracy and 
reliability in decision-making.
By providing a quantitative and holistic view of asset 
health, the AHI enables us to prioritise maintenance 
activities effectively, mitigate operational risks, and 
extend asset lifespans. Integrating AHI within DigiGrid 
demonstrates the platform’s capability to drive 
predictive maintenance strategies, reduce unplanned 
downtime, and optimise resource allocation. DigiGrid 
and the AHI exemplify our digital transformation 
journey, enhancing resilience,reliability, and value 
delivery across our assets.

Loss Contingencies
KKR establishes an accrued liability for legal or regulatory proceedings only when those matters present loss
contingenciesthatarebothprobableandreasonablyestimable.KKRincludesinitsfinancialstatementstheamountof
anyreserveforregulatory,litigationandrelatedmattersthatGlobalAtlanticincludesinitsfinancialstatements.Noloss
contingencyisrecordedformatterswheresuchlossesareeithernotprobableorreasonablyestimable(orboth)atthe
timeofdetermination.Suchmattersalsohavethepossibilityofresultinginlossesinexcessofanyamountsaccrued.To
theextentKKRcaninanyparticularperiodestimateanaggregaterangeofreasonablypossiblelosses,thesedecisions
involvesignificantjudgmentgiventhatitisinherentlydifficulttodeterminewhetheranylossforamatterisprobableor
evenpossibleortoestimatetheamountofanylossinmanylegal,governmentalandregulatorymatters.
Estimatinganaccruedliabilityorareasonablypossiblelossinvolvessignificantjudgmentduetomanyuncertainties,
includingamongothers:(i)theproceedingmaybeinearlystages;(ii)damagessoughtmaybeunspecified,unsupportable,
unexplainedoruncertain;(iii)discoverymaynothavebeenstartedorisincomplete;(iv)theremaybeuncertaintyastothe
outcomeofpendingappealsormotions;(v)theremaybesignificantfactualissuestoberesolved;(vi)theremaybenovel
legalissuesorunsettledlegaltheoriestobepresentedoralargenumberofparties;or(vii)theproceedingrelatestoa
regulatoryexamination,inquiry,orinvestigation.Itisnotpossibletopredicttheultimateoutcomeofallpendinglitigations,
arbitrations,claims,andgovernmentalorregulatoryexaminations,inquiries,investigationsandproceedings,andsome
ofthemattersdiscussedaboveseekormayseekpotentiallylargeorindeterminaterelief.Consequently,managementis
unableasofthedateoffilingofthequarterlyreporttoestimateanamountorrangeofreasonablypossiblelossesrelated
tomatterspendingagainstKKR.Inaddition,anyamountsaccruedaslosscontingenciesordisclosedasreasonably
possiblelossesmaybe,inpartorinwhole,subjecttoinsuranceorotherpaymentssuchascontributionsandindemnity,
whichmayreduceanyultimateloss.
Asofthedateoffilingthequarterlyreport,managementdoesnotbelieve,basedoncurrentlyavailableinformation,that
theoutcomesofthematterspendingagainstKKRwillhaveamaterialadverseeffectuponitsfinancialstatements.
However,giventhepotentiallylargeand/orindeterminatereliefsoughtorthatmaybesoughtincertainofthesematters
andtheinherentunpredictabilityoflitigations,arbitrations,claims,andgovernmentalorregulatoryexaminations,inquiries,

effectonKKR’sfinancialresultsinanyfutureperiod.Inaddition,therecanbenoassurancethatmateriallosseswillnotbe
incurredfromclaimsthathavenotyetbeenassertedorthosewherepotentiallosseshavenotyetbeendeterminedtobe

18. RISK FACTORS
 AtIndiGrid,webelievethatarobustriskmanagementframeworkisessentialtomaintainingourfinancialstability,operational
resilience,andlong-termabilitytodeliverpredictabledistributions.AsapubliclylistedInfrastructureInvestmentTrust
(InvIT),weoperateinadynamicenvironmentmarkedbyregulatoryevolution,technologicalshifts,andmacroeconomic
volatility.Ourdiversifiedportfolio–comprisingoperationalandunder-constructionassetsinpowertransmission,solar
generation,andbatterystorage–exposesustoabroadspectrumofstrategic,operational,financial,regulatory,andESG-
relatedrisks.
 Tomitigatetheseexposures,weadoptaproactive,multi-layeredapproachtoriskmanagementthatisembeddedinour
governanceprocesses,investmentevaluationframeworks,andoperationalprotocols.TheRiskManagementCommittee
oftheInvestmentManagerregularlymonitorskeyrisksandmitigationactions,enablingtimelyandinformeddecision-
making.
 1. Strategic and Growth Risks
  IndiGrid’slong-termvaluecreationdependsonourabilitytoidentify,acquire,andefficientlyintegrateinfrastructure
assets.However,thisgrowth-orientedstrategyexposesustocertainstructuralrisks:
• Execution Risk in Acquisitions: Thesuccessofourexpansionplanshingesontimelydealclosuresand
seamlessintegrationofacquiredassets.Delaysinregulatoryapprovals,duediligencefindings,orpost-
acquisitionperformanceissuescanimpactourreturnsandoverallportfolioperformance.
• Limited Flexibility in Tariff Structures:Alargeproportionofourassetsoperateunderlong-termTransmission
ServiceAgreements(TSAs)orPowerPurchaseAgreements(PPAs)withfixedorregulatedtariffs.Whilethis
providesstability,italsolimitsourabilitytorepricecontractsinresponsetoinflation,risingoperatingcosts,or
marketchanges.
• Exposure to Under-Construction Projects:Withourgrowinginvolvementingreenfieldanddevelopment-stage
assets–suchasBatteryEnergyStorageSystems(BESS)andnewtransmissionlines–weareincreasingly
exposedtoconstructiondelays,costoverruns,evolvingpolicyframeworks,andexecutioncomplexitiesinherent
inlarge-scaleinfrastructureprojects.
 2. Operational Risks
  Asanasset-intensiveplatform,ouroperationalperformancedirectlyinfluencescashflowgenerationanddistribution
stability.Weremainvigilantofseveraloperatingrisksthatcouldaffectassetavailability,output,orcoststructures:
• Availability-Linked Revenues:Ourtransmissionrevenuesarecontingentonmaintainingsystemavailability
abovepredefinedthresholds(typically>98%).Anyoperationaldowntime–whetherduetoequipmentfailure,
weatherevents,orforcemajeure–whilemaybecomprehensivelycoveredundertheconcessionsagreement
butcanresultinpenaltiesorinterimreductionincashinflows.
• Weather-Linked Solar Generation: Solarassetperformanceisinherentlydependentonirradiationlevelsand
climaticconditions.Unexpectedweathervariations,gridcurtailments,ortechnicaldegradationofmodulescan
adverselyaffectpowergenerationandrevenues.
STATUTORY DISCLOSURES (Contd.)
154
Semi Annual Report 2025-26
• Battery Storage Performance:Batteryenergystorageisarelativelynascentassetclasswithevolvingstandards
formaintenanceandlifecycleperformance.Challengesrelatedtobatterydegradation,efficiencyloss,orunclear
end-of-liferecyclingprotocolscouldresultinunderperformanceorhigheroperatingcostsovertime.
• IT Systems and Cybersecurity:Asweincreaseourrelianceondigitalplatformsforassetmanagement,remote
monitoring,andSCADA-basedcontrolsystems,weareexposedtorisksarisingfromcyberattacks,system
vulnerabilities,ordatabreaches.
 3. Regulatory and Counterparty Risks
  Ouroperationsaredeeplyinfluencedbytheregulatoryandinstitutionallandscapegoverningthepowersector.While
long-termcontractsprovideadegreeofpredictability,certainriskspersist:
• Regulatory Evolution: Changesinpoliciesorregulationsissuedbycentralandstateelectricityregulatory
commissions(CERC/SERC)relatingtotariffs,availabilitynorms,transmissionlossallocation,orstorage
guidelinescouldaffectourrevenuevisibilityandcoststructure.
• Counterparty Credit Risk: Asignificantportionofourrevenuesdependsonpaymentsfromstateutilitiesor
government-relatedentities.Whilepooledpaymentmechanismshelpmitigateriskintransmissionassets,
delayedreceivablesordefaults–especiallyinsolarorBESSprojects–couldaffectcashflowtiming.
• Grid Connectivity and Curtailment: Solarandstorageassetsdependonexternaltransmissioninfrastructure
forpowerevacuation.Anydelayinsubstationreadiness,gridcongestion,orregulatorycurtailmentinstructions
mayresultinpartialorfulllossofgenerationandassociatedrevenues.
 4. Financial and Structural Risks
  Asa yield-focused platform, we actively manage our capital structure to ensure sustainable distributions.
Nevertheless,severalfinancialrisksrequireclosemonitoring:
• Leverage and Market Yield Risk: IndiGridadherestoSEBI-prescribedleveragethresholds,maintaininganet
debtcapof70%ofassetvalue.However,changesininterestratesoryieldexpectationsinthebroaderdebt
marketmayinfluenceourrefinancingterms,impacttheattractivenessofIndiGrid’sreturnsrelativetofixed-
incomealternatives,andaffectinvestorsentiment.Sustainedperiodsofrisingratescouldalsopressureour
costofcapitalanddistributionheadroom.
• Subordination of Cash Flows:AsanequityinvestorinSPVs,ourentitlementtocashflowsissubordinatedto
seniordebtserviceandoperationalexpenses.Anyadverselegal,operational,orenforcementeventattheSPV
levelcoulddisruptcashupstreamingtoIndiGrid.
• Tax and Regulatory Uncertainty:Changesintaxationlaws–especiallythosegoverningInvITstructures,capital
gains,ordividenddistribution–mayalterdistributablesurpluscalculationsandaffectinvestorreturns.
• Insurance Adequacy:Whilealloperatingassetsareinsuredagainststandardperilsandbusinessinterruption,
certainextremeevents,forcemajeuresituations,orclaimrejectionsmayfalloutsidepolicyandconcession
agreementcoverage,exposingustofinancialloss.
• Foreign Exchange Risk: AlthoughIndiGridprimarilyoperatesintheIndianrupeeecosystem,theremaybe
limitedexposuretoforeignexchangevolatilityincaseswhereequipmentprocurement,vendorcontracts,or
financingarrangementsarelinkedtoforeigncurrencies.
 5. ESG and Reputational Risks
  IndiGridiscommittedtoenvironmentalstewardship,communityalignment,andgovernanceexcellence.However,
asscrutinyfromregulators,investors,andcivilsocietycontinuestoincrease,ESG-relatedriskswarrantfocused
oversight:
• Land and Community Engagement:Infrastructureprojectsoftenrequirelandacquisitionandengagementwith
localcommunities.Resistancefromstakeholders,landdisputes,orinadequatesocialimpactmeasurescan
leadtoprojectdelays,legalliabilities,orcostescalation.

IndiGrid Infrastructure Trust (formerly known as India Grid Trust)
• Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE): Anylapseinadherencetooccupationalhealthandsafetyprotocols
canendangerworkers,inviteregulatorypenalties,andtarnishourreputation.Giventhedistributednatureofour
assets,maintainingHSEconsistencyisakeyfocusarea.
• Climate Risk and Technological Obsolescence: Climatechangeimpacts–suchasincreasedweathervolatility
ornewemissionsregulations–canaffectassetoperationsandlifecycleeconomics.Additionally,technological
shifts(e.g.,evolvingbatterychemistries)mayrendercertainassetclasseslesscompetitiveorefficientover
time.
• Reputational Risk:Asalistedplatformwithawideinvestorbase,IndiGrid’sreputationiscloselylinkedtoits
governancestandards,ESGdisclosures,regulatorycompliance,andstakeholderconduct.Anydeviationfrom
statedvaluesorstakeholderexpectationscanleadtoerosionofinvestortrustandmarketcredibility.
 6. Human Capital Risk
  IndiGrid’sabilitytoattract,retain,anddevelopskilledprofessionalsiscriticaltosustainingoperationalexcellenceand
executingitsgrowthstrategy.Astheplatformexpandsandevolves,risksmayarisefromtalentattrition,skillgaps,
andintegrationchallengesacrossacquiredentities:
• Dependence on Skilled Talent: IndiGrid’ssuccessisbuiltonateamofprofessionalswithdeepexpertisein
assetoperations,regulatoryaffairs,finance,andESGintegration.Retainingandattractinghigh-qualitytalent
remainsessentialformaintainingperformanceanddeliveringlong-termvalue.
• Attrition and Succession Planning: Thedepartureofkeyindividuals–especiallyinleadership,commercial,
ortechnicalroles–canleadtoknowledgegapsandtemporarydisruption.Absenceofstructuredsuccession
planningmayheightenthisriskincriticalfunctions.
• Evolving Skill Requirements: Withtheincreasingcomplexityofoperationsandourentryintoemerging
segmentslikebatteryenergystorage,ourtalentneedsareevolving.Failuretoanticipateorrespondtothese
shiftsthroughtimelyupskillingorrecruitmentcouldimpactstrategicexecution.
• Cultural Integration Post-Acquisition: IndiGrid’sgrowthmodelreliesonacquiringandintegratingdiverse
infrastructureassets.Misalignmentinculture,values,orworkforcepracticesacrossnewSPVscanpose
challengesinstandardisingperformanceandengagementlevelsacrosstheplatform.

InvestmentTrust),Regulations,2014(InvITRegulations),
IndiGridissupposedtocarryoutindependentvaluation
foritsassets.Mr.S.Sundararaman,RegisteredValuer,has
carriedoutyearlyfinancialvaluationofallthetransmission,
solarandBESSassetsattheenterpriselevel.Enterprise
valueisdescribedasthetotalvalueoftheequityina
businessplusthevalueofitsdebtanddebtrelatedliabilities,
minusanycashorcashequivalentstomeetthoseliabilities.
VALUATION APPROACH
TherevenuesoftheTransmissionAssetsaredefinedfor
35yearsundertheTSAexceptforENICLwhichisdefined
for25yearsundertheTSA.WhereasfortheSolarAssets,
tariffratesaredefinedfor25yearsunderthePPA.Insuch
scenario,thetrueworthofitsbusinesswouldbereflected
initsfutureearningspotentialandtherefore,DCFmethod
hasbeenconsidered asanappropriate method bythe
valuer,except for DPTL, IPTL, KTCO,NRSS II, GPTL II,
RKPTL,GBPL,RBPL&TLSitamauss.

amounting to 0.5% of Enterprise Value of new assets/SPVs/businesses acquired, subject to achieving Distribution 
Per Unit (DPU) guidance. For this purpose, operating expenses would not include depreciation, finance costs and 
income tax expense. There are no changes in the methodology of computation of fees paid to Investment Manager. 
The Investment management fee for quarter ended June 30, 2025 was higher due to the inclusion of acquisition fees 
at 0.5% of the enterprise value of KNTL and RSAPL acquired during the quarter.
8  The provision for impairment/reversal of impairment of investments in subsidiaries is made based on the difference 
between the carrying amounts and the recoverable amounts. The recoverable amount of the investments in 
subsidiaries has been computed by external independent valuation experts based on value in use calculation for 
the underlying projects (based on discounted cash flow model). On a periodic basis, according to the recoverable 
amounts of individual portfolio assets computed by the valuation experts, the Trust tests impairment on the amounts 
invested in the respective subsidiary companies. The valuation exercise so carried out considers various factors 
including cash flow projections, changes in interest rates, discount rates, risk premium for market conditions etc.
9  Under the provisions of the InvIT Regulations, the Trust is required to distribute to Unitholders not less than 90% of 
the Net Distributable Cash Flows of the Trust for each financial year. Accordingly, Unit Capital contains a contractual 
obligation to pay cash to the Unitholders. Thus, in accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 32 - Financial 
Instruments: Presentation, the Unit Capital contains a liability element which should have been classified and treated 
accordingly. However, Para 4.2.3(a) of SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/DDHS-PoD-2/P/CIR/2025/102 dated July 
11, 2025, (as amended from time to time) issued under the InVIT Regulations, require the Unit Capital in entirety to be 
presented/classified as “Equity”, which is at variance from the requirements of Ind AS 32. In order to comply with the 
aforesaid SEBI requirements, the Trust has considered unit capital as equity.
10  The Board of Directors of the Investment Manager approved a distribution of INR 4.00 per unit (out of which  
INR 0.7465 per unit pertains towards capital repayment) for the period 01 July 2025 to 30 September 2025 to be paid 
within 5 working days from the record date. 
11  Subsequent Event: On November 03, 2025, the Trust has received approval for issuance of additional units on a 
preferential basis at an issue price of Rs. 168.77 per unit from its unitholders, persuant to Securities and Exchange

4 During the current quarter, Parbati Koldam Transmission Company Limited (“PrKTCL”) received true-up order and 
tariff determination orders from the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (“CERC”) for the periods FY 2014–19 
and FY 2019–24 respectively.
 Pursuant to the true-up order for FY 2014–19, CERC disallowed certain capital costs, including expenditure towards 
the corporate building, resulting in a revenue reversal of INR 72 Million. Further, based on the tariff determination 
order for FY 2019–24, which specifies the approved revenue for the said period, PrKTCL has recognized a revenue 
reversal of INR 163 Million for the period from FY 2019 up to the order date (July 23, 2025). Interest of INR 136 Million 
on the above adjustments has also been provided for in the current quarter.
5 Pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement dated June 13, 2023 (as amended), Investment Manager is 
entitled to fees @ 1.75% of difference between revenue from operations and operating expenses (other than fees 
of the Investment Manager) of each SPV per annum or 0.25% of AUM, whichever is lower and acquisition fees 
amounting to 0.5% of Enterprise Value of new assets/SPVs/businesses acquired, subject to achieving Distribution 
Per Unit (DPU) guidance. For this purpose, operating expenses would not include depreciation, finance costs and 
income tax expense. There are no changes in the methodology of computation of fees paid to Investment Manager. 
The Investment management fee for quarter ended June 30, 2025 was higher due to the inclusion of acquisition fees 
at 0.5% of the enterprise value of KNTL and RSAPL acquired during the quarter.
6 Under the Project Implementation and Management Agreement, the Project Manager is responsible for the operation 
and maintenance of all project SPVs and is entitled to a fee of 7% of the gross expenditure incurred by each SPV, 
except for Jhajjar KT Transco Private Limited (“JKTPL”), for which a fixed annual fee of ₹ 80.5 million, subject to an 
annual escalation of 5%, is charged.
 Indigrid Limited (“IGL”) serves as the Project Manager for all SPVs in the Power Transmission and Power Generation 
segments, while Enerica Infra 1 Private Limited (“ENR1”) acts as the Project Manager for all SPVs in the Power 
Storage segment. The project management fees paid by the respective SPVs to IGL or ENR1 are eliminated upon 
consolidation. The methodology for computing project management fees remains unchanged
7 During the March 2025 quarter, the Trust along with IGL2 had entered into an Inter-se Agreement to transfer 26% of 
the equity shares of Jaisalmer Urja VI Private Limited (“JUPL”) (formerly Renew Solar Urja Private Limited) to Enerica 
Regrid Infra Private Limited (“ERIPL”). Based on the terms of the Inter-se Agreement and the principles of Ind AS 115, 
the Group had concluded that it continued to hold 100% of the beneficial and economic interest in JUPL. During the 
current quarter, the Trust along with IGL2 has bought back the aforesaid 26% equity shares of JUPL from ERIPL at 
the same consideration at which they were originally transferred, based on a fair valuation report.

the Net Distributable Cash Flows of the Trust for each financial year. Accordingly, Unit Capital contains a contractual 
obligation to pay cash to the Unitholders. Thus, in accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 32 - Financial 
Instruments: Presentation, the Unit Capital contains a liability element which should have been classified and treated 
accordingly. However, Para 4.2.3(a) of SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/DDHS-PoD-2/P/CIR/2025/102 dated July 
11, 2025, (as amended from time to time) issued under the InVIT Regulations, require the Unit Capital in entirety to be 
presented/classified as “Equity”, which is at variance from the requirements of Ind AS 32. In order to comply with the 
aforesaid SEBI requirements, the Trust has considered unit capital as equity.

These SPVs were acquired by the Trust and are to be valued as per Regulation 21(5) contained in the Chapter V 
of the SEBI InvIT Regulations. 
As per Regulation 21(5) of Chapter V of the SEBI InvIT Regulations: 
“A half yearly valuation of the assets of the InvIT shall be conducted by the valuer for the half -year ending 
September 30th for a publicly offered InvIT for incorporating any key changes in the previous six months and such 
half yearly valuation report shal l be submitted by the Investment Manager to the designated stock exchanges(s) 
along with the quarterly financial results for quarter ending 30th September.  
If the consolidated borrowings and deferred payments of an InvIT, in terms 
of  regulation  20  of  these  regulations,  exceeds  forty  nine  per  cent.;  a quarterly valuation of the assets of InvIT 
shall be conducted by the valuer as at the end of the qu arters ending June, September and December for 
incorporating any key changes from the previous quarter and such quarterly valuation report shall be submitted by 
the investment manager to the  designated  stock exchange(s) along with the quarterly financial results of the 
corresponding quarter.” 
I understand from the Investment Manager that Debt to AUM of Indigrid Infrastructure Trust as at 30th June 2025 
was 61.20%. In this regard, the Investment M anager and the Trustee intends to undertake the fair enterprise 
valuation of the SPVs as on 30th September 2025 (“Valuation Date”) for incorporating any key changes from the 
period ended 30th June 2025 till 30th September 2025.

I am enclosing the Report providing opinion on the fair enterprise value of the SPVs on a going concern basis as 
at 30th September 2025 (“Valuation Date”).  
Enterprise Value (“EV”) is described as the total value of the equity in a business plus the value of its debt and debt 
related liabilities, minus any cash or cash equivalents to meet those liabilities. The attached Report details the 
valuation methodologies used, calculations performed and the conclusion reached with respect to this valuation. 
I have relied on explanations and information provided by the Investment Manager. Although, I have reviewed such 
data for consistency, those are not independently investigated or otherwise verified. My team and I have no present 
or planned future interest in the Trust, the SPVs or the Investment Manager except to the extent of this appointment 
as an independent valuer and the fee for this Valuation Report (“Report”) which is not contingent upon the values 
reported herein. The valuation analysis should not be construed as investment advice, specifically, I do not express 
any opinion on the suitability or otherwise of entering into any financial or other transaction with the Trust. 
The analysis must be considered as a whole. Selecting portions of any analysis or the factors that are considered 
in this Report, without considering all factors and analysis together could create a misleading view of the process 
underlying the valuation c onclusions. The preparation of a valuation is a complex process and is not necessarily 
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Any attempt to do so could lead to undue emphasis on any 
particular factor or analysis.  
The information provided to me by the Investment Manager in relation to the SPVs included but not limited to 
historical financial statements, forecasts/projections, other statements and assumptions about future matters like 
forward-looking financial inform ation prepared by the Investment Manager. The forecasts and projections as 
supplied to me are based upon assumptions about events and circumstances which are yet to occur. I have not 
tested individual assumptions or attempted to substantiate the veracity or integrity of such assumptions in relation 
to the forward -looking financial information, however, I have made sufficient enquiry to satisfy myself that such 
information has been prepared on a reasonable basis. 
Notwithstanding anything above, I cannot provide any assurance that the forward looking financial information will 
be representative of the results which will actually be achieved during the cash flow forecast period.  
The valuation provided by me and the valuation conclusion are included herein and the Report complies with the 
SEBI InvIT Regulations and guidelines, circular or notification issued by SEBI thereunder. 
Please note that all comments in the Report must be read in conjunction with the caveats to the Report, which are 
contained in Section 11 of this Report. This letter, the Report and the summary of valuation included herein can be 
provided to Trust’s adviso rs and may be made available for the inspection to the public and with the SEBI, the 
stock exchanges and any other regulatory and supervisory authority, as may be required. 
I draw your attention to the limitation of liability clauses in Section 11 of this Report.  
This letter should be read in conjunction with the attached Report. 
 
Yours faithfully,

described as the total value of the equity in a business plus the value of its debt and debt related liabilities, minus any cash 
and cash equivalents to meet those liabilities. 
iv. I declare that: 
a. I am competent to undertake the financial valuation in terms of the SEBI InvIT Regulations; 
b. I am not an associate of the sponsor(s) or investment manager or trustee and I have not less than five years of experience 
in valuation of infrastructure assets; 
c. I am independent and has prepared the Valuation Report (“the Report”) on a fair and unbiased basis. 
d. I have valued the SPVs based on the valuation standards as specified / applicable as per SEBI InvIT Regulations. 
This Report covers all the disclosures required as per the SEBI InvIT Regulations and the valuation of the SPVs is impartial, 
true and fair and in compliance with the SEBI InvIT Regulations. 
(Please refer appendix 13 for further information about myself) 
 
1.7. Scope of Valuation 
i. Financial Asset to be Valued: 
The RV has been mandated by the Investment Manager to arrive at the Enterprise Value of the SPVs. Enterprise Value is 
described as the total value of the equity in a business plus the value of its debt and debt related liabilities, minus any cash or 
cash equivalents to meet those liabilities. 
ii. Valuation Bases: 
Valuation base means the indication of the type of value being used in an engagement. In the present case, I have determined 
the fair value of the SPVs at the enterprise level. Fair Value Bases defined as under: 
Fair Value: 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the valuation date. It is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an 
orderly transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under current market conditions 
(i.e. an exit price) regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. Fair 
value or Market value is usually synonymous to each other except in certain circumstances where characteristics of an asset 
translate into a special asset value for the party(ies) involved. 
iii. Valuation Date: 
Valuation Date is the specific date at which the value of the assets to be valued gets estimated or measured.  Valuation is 
time specific and can change with the passage of time due to changes in the condition of the asset to be valued. Accordingly, 
valuation of an asset as at a particular date can be different from other date(s). 
The valuation date considered for the fair enterprise valuation of the SPVs is 30th September 2025 (“Valuation Date”). The 
attached Report is drawn up by reference to accounting and financial information as on 30th September 2025. The RV is 
not aware of any other events having occurred since 30th September 2025 till date of this Report which he deems to be 
significant for his valuation analysis. 
iv. Premise of Value: 
Premise of Value refers to the conditions and circumstances about how an asset is deployed. In the present case, I have 
determined the fair enterprise value of the SPVs on a Going Concern Value defined as under:

Going Concern Value:  
Going concern value is the value of a business enterprise that is expected to continue to operate in the future. The intangible 
elements of Going Concern Value result from factors such as having a trained work force, an operational plant, the 
necessary licenses, systems, and procedures in place etc.

1.8. Summary of Valuation 
I have assessed the fair enterprise value of each of the SPVs on a stand -alone basis by using the Discounted Cash Flow 
(“DCF”) method under the income approach. Following table summarizes my explaination on the usage or non usage of 
different valuation methods: 
 
Valuation 
Approach 
Valuation 
Methodology Used Remarks 
Cost approach Net Assets Value 
method 
Yes 
Transmission Assets: NRSS-II, GPTL -II, KTCO, DPTL, IPTL, and 
RKPTL are currently under construction, with their expected COD after 3 
to 24 months. Given this stage of development, the certainty of cash flows 
is relatively higher only post -COD or when the overall project progress 
reaches a materially  significant level, making revenue generation 
reasonably certain. Hence in present case the above SPVs that are under 
construction as at valuation date are valued at NAV Method. 
The business of TL Sitamau Sub-Station is primarily for captive 
consumption, as a result the entire revenue is generated from the current 
SPVs of the InvIT. Hence, in such circumstances, more than the earnings 
the underlying asset is relatively of higher importance  and I have 
considered NAV method as the primary method for valuation of this SPV. 
No 
Solar Assets: NAV does not capture the future earning potential of the 
business. Since all the Solar assets have achieved COD, NAV method 
has not been considered for Solar Assets. 
Yes 
BESS Assets: GBPL and RBPL are under construction and their likely 
COD is after 8 to 24 months. In such circumstances the certainty of cash 
flows are relatively more only after COD or % completion are at material 
level and reasonably certain . Hence in present case the SPVs that are 
under construction as at valuation date are valued at NAV Method. 
KBPL have achieved COD and is operational in nature, since NAV does 
not capture the future earning potential of the business, KBPL is valued 
as per Income approach as defined below. 
Income 
Approach 
Discounted Cash 
Flows method Yes 
Transmission Assets:  The revenues of the Transmission Assets are 
defined for 35 years under the TSA (for ENICL the TSA period is only for 
25 years ). In such scenario, the true worth of its business would be 
reflected in its future earnings potential and therefore, DCF method under 
the income approach has been considered as an appropriate method for 
the present valuation exercise. 
For Transmission Assets,  the terminal value is calculated based on the 
business potential for further growth beyond the explicit forecast period. 
The “constant growth model” is applied, which implies an expected 
constant level of growth for perpetuity in the cash flows over the last year 
of the forecast period. 
JKTPL is based on DBFOT model  in which case the asset is to be 
transferred at the end of 35 years and hence the terminal period value for 
JKTPL  has been considered based on the value on account of cash flows 
from realization of working capital at the end of the tenure. 
NRSS-II, GPTL -II, KTCO, DPTL, IPTL, RKPTL, are under construction  
assets and as explained above these SPVs are valued based on NAV 
method.  
Solar Assets: 
The tariff rates for Solar Assets are defined for 25 years under the PPA. 
In such scenario, the true worth of its business would be reflected in its 
future earnings potential  and therefore, DCF Method under the income 
approach has been considered as an appropriate method for the present 
valuation exercise.  
The ownership of the underlying assets (tangible assets) except the 
leasehold land shall remain with the SPVs even after the expiry of PPA 
term. The terminal period value (i.e. value on account of cash flows to be 
generated after the expiry of the period) has been considered based on 
the salvage value of the plant & machinery, sale of freehold land and 
realization of working capital at the end of the tenure.  
BESS Assets: The revenues of the BESS Assets are defined for 12-15 
years under the BESPA. In such scenario, the true worth of its business 
would be reflected in its future earnings potential and therefore, DCF 
method under the income approach has been considered as an 
appropriate method for the present valuation exercise. 
In case of KBPL the respective asset is as per BOOT model in which case 
the asset is to be transferred at the end of 12 years and hence the terminal 
period value for KBPL has been considered based on the value on

                   Fair Enterprise Valuation of SPVs

account of cash flows from realization of working capital at the end of the 
tenure. 
GBPL and RBPL are under construction assets and as explained above 
these SPVs are valued based on NAV method.  
 Capitalization of 
Earnings Method No 
In the present case, the revenue of the SPVs are either pre -determined 
or could be fairly estimated for the life of the projects. Since the future 
earning can easily be estimated, I find it appropriate to not consider 
Capitalization of Earnings Method for the current valuation exercise. 
Market 
Approach  
Market Price 
method No 
Currently, the equity shares of SPVs are not listed on any recognized 
stock exchange of India. Hence, I was unable to apply market price 
method. 
 
Comparable 
Companies 
multiples method 
No 
In the absence of any exactly comparable listed companies with 
characteristics and parameters similar to that of the SPVs, I have not 
considered CCM method in the present case. 
 
Comparable 
Transactions 
multiples method 
No In the absence of adequate details about Comparable Transactions, I was 
unable to apply the CTM method. 
 
Under the DCF Method, the Free Cash Flow to Firm (“ FCFF”) has been used for the purpose of valuation of each of the 
SPVs. In order to arrive at the fair EV of the individual SPVs under the DCF Method, I have relied on the Unaudited 
provisional financial statements as at 30th September 2025 prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards 
(Ind AS) and the financial projections of the respective SPVs prepared by the Investment Manager as at the Valuation Date 
based on their best judgement.  The discount rate considered for the respective SPVs for the purpose of this valuation 
exercise is based on the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (“WACC”) for each of the SPVs. 
   Based on the methodology and assumptions discussed further, RV has arrived at the fair enterprise value of the SPVs as 
on the Valuation Date:

Further to above considering that present valuation exercise is based on the future financial performance and based on 
opinions on the future credit risk, cost of debt assumptions, etc., which represent reasonable expectations at a particular 
point of time , but such information, estimates or opinions are not offered as predictions or as assurances that a particular 
level of income or profit will be achieved, a particular event will occur or that a particular price will be offered or accep ted. 
Actual results achieved during the period covered by the prospective financial analysis will vary from these estimates and 
variations may be material.  Accordingly, a quantitative sensitivity analysis is considered on the following unobservable 
inputs.: 
1. Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) by increasing / decreasing it by 0.5% 
2. Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) by increasing / decreasing it by 1.0% 
3. Total Expenses considered during the projected period by increasing / decreasing it by 20% 
4. Terminal period value considered for the SPVs increasing / decreasing it by 20%

(A) Transmission Assets: 
1. Bhopal Dhule Transmission Company Limited (“BDTCL”) 
• The BDTCL project was awarded to IndiGrid Limited (formerly known as Sterlite Grid 1 Limited) by the 
Ministry of Power on 31st January 2011 for a 35 year period from the scheduled commercial operation date 
on a BOOM basis. The expiry date of TSA shall be the date which is 35 years from the Scheduled Commercial 
Operation Date (“SCOD”) of the project. 
• BDTCL operates six extra high voltage overhead transmission lines of 943 Ckms comprising four 765 kV 
single circuit lines of 890 Ckms and two 400 kV dual circuit lines of 53 Ckms. The single circuit lines comprise 
a 259 ckms line from Jabalpur to Bhopal in  Madhya Pradesh, a 176 Ckms line from Bhopal to Indore in 
Madhya Pradesh, a 192 Ckms line from Aurangabad to Dhule in Maharashtra and a 263 Ckms line from 
Dhule (Maharashtra) to Vadodara (Gujarat). The double circuit lines consist of a 36 Ckms line within Dhule 
and a 17 Ckms line within Bhopal. In addition, the project includes two 3,000 MVA sub - stations, one each 
in Bhopal and Dhule. BDTCL facilitates the transfer of electricity from coal -fired power generation sources 
from the states of Odisha and Chhattisgarh to power load centers in India’s western and northern regions.

was granted Transmission License by CERC on 29th September 2016. GPTL consists of three GIS  
substations, transmission lines and two bays to meet the rising power demand in Gurgaon and Palwal. 
• GPTL consists of three gas-insulated substations (GIS) with a total transformation capacity of 3,000 MVA and 
~273 circuit kilometers of 400 KV transmission lines, to enhance power transmission in the region. Due to 
change in law during the construction period, GPTL has been claiming an increase in Non Escalable 
Transmission charges at the rate of 1.52% from its Long-Term Transmission Customers. I have considered 
such an increase in Non Escalable Transmission charges based on representation by the Investment Manager

• Operating Efficiency history of GPTL: 
 
 
 
* The normative availability of GPTL is 98% in the year 2025. But, as mentioned above in the report about the breakdown 
of transformer in FY25, the actual availability dropped down to 96.84% in FY25. The incentive loss for the same was 
reflected in the Financials of FY25. 
 
B. GPTL- II 
• GPTL was awarded an extension project under Cost plus mechanism as per order of Central Transmission 
Utility of India on 24th June 2022, having reached 50% of its total project cost. Since detailed financial 
projections up to the Commercial Operation Date (COD) are not available, the estimated value of this ongoing 
project has been factored into GPTL's overall valuation using NAV method.

11. NER-II Transmission Limited (“NERTL”) 
• The NERTL project was awarded to SGL 4, wholly owned subsidiary of SPGVL (now merged with SPTL), by 
the Ministry of Power for a period of 35 years from SCOD of NERTL on a BOOM basis. NERTL was granted 
Transmission License by CERC on 23rd May 2017. The proj ect has 11 elements including two substations 
of~1,260 MVA capacity and four transmission lines extending over ~898 circuit kilometers. The asset spans 
across the states of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura. 
• Due to change in law during the construction period, NERTL has been claiming an increase in Non Escalable 
Transmission charges through an order dated 19th May 2024 at the rate of 2.39%, from its Long Term 
Transmission Customers. I have considered such an increase in Non Escalable Transmission charges based 
on representation by the Investment Manager

12. Raichur Sholapur Transmission Company Private Limited (“RSTCPL”) 
• RSTCPL was incorporated on 19th November 2009 to establish transmission system for evacuation of power 
from Krishnapattnam UMPP and other IPPS in southern region to beneficiaries in the western region of India. 
The SPV was responsible for the construction of one line of 765 KV between Raichur and Sholapur. 
• As informed by the Investment Manager, based on the due diligence done, 3 towers of the transmission line 
of the SPV collapsed in the month of May 2019 due to heavy storms, due to which the availability for the 
months of June and July 2019 were affected. The deemed availability was granted to the SPV for the month 
of June 2019, but not for July 2019. The Investment Manager has informed that it was an exceptional one-
time event and that they do not foresee any deficiency in the transmission assets of the SPV.

13. Khargone Transmission Limited (“KhTL”) 
• KhTL was incorporated to establish transmission system for Transmission System Strengthening in WR 
associated with Khargone Thermal Power Plant of 1,320 MW (2×660MW) at Khargone in the state of Madhya 
Pradesh. The SPV was responsible for the construction of 4 transmission lines between Maharashtra and 
Southern region. The project will evacuate 1,320 MW of power generated by the Khargone Power Plant to 765 
kV Khandwa substation to further distribute it downstream across Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, 
Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Goa, Daman & Diu, and Dadra & Nagar Haveli. 
• KhTL was incorporated on 28th November 2015 by REC Transmission Projects Company Limited. After 
successful completion of the bidding process for the project, the SPV was transferred to a Sterlite Grid 4 
Limited vide share purchase agreement dated 22nd August 2016. Further, during FY 2021-22, Sterlite Grid 4 
Limited was merged into its immediate holding company, i.e. Sterlite Power Transmission Limited. 
• Due to change in law (GST impact) during the construction period, KhTL has been claiming an increase in 
Non Escalable Transmission charges at the rate of ~1.57% from its Long-Term Transmission Customers. I 
have considered such an increase in transmission charges based on the representation by the Investment 
Manager.

5.3. Global Renewable Energy Outlook 
5.3.1. In FY24 Solar and wind energy dominated new capacity additions, with solar capacity growing by 88% and 
surpassing hydropower and nuclear. 
5.3.2. Global energy demand grew by 2.2% in 2024 – faster than the average rate over the past decade. Demand for all 
fuels and technologies expanded in 2024. The increase was led by the power sector as electricity demand surged 
by 4.3%, well above the 3.2% growth in global GDP, driven by record temperatures, electrification and digitalisation. 
Renewables accounted for the largest share of the growth in global energy supply (38%), followed by natural gas 
(28%), coal (15%), oil (11%) and nuclear (8%). 
5.3.3. Global electricity consumption rose by nearly 1100 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2024, more than twice the annual average 
increase over the past decade. 
5.3.4. Under existing policies and market conditions, global renewable capacity is forecast to reach 7,300 GW by 2028. 
This growth trajectory would see global capacity increase to 2.5 times its current level by 2030, falling short of the 
tripling goal. 
5.3.5. The driving forces behind growth in renewable energy capacity includes robust policy support, energy security 
priorities and improved competitiveness against fossil fuels, outweighing challenges like higher costs and supply 
chain issues 
5.3.6. Escalating electricity prices from the energy crisis prompted policymakers, particularly in Europe, to prioritize energy 
security and seek alternatives to imported fossil fuels. This shift favors solar PV, especially for quick installation of 
residential and commercial systems to meet surging requirement for renewable energy. 
5.3.7. According to IEA’s Renewable 2024 Report, over the coming six years several renewable energy milestones are 
expected to be achieved: 
• In 2024, solar PV and wind generation together surpass hydropower generation. 
• In 2025, renewables-based electricity generation overtakes coal-fired. 
• In 2026, wind and solar power generation both surpasses nuclear. 
• In 2027, solar PV electricity generation surpasses wind. 
• In 2029, solar PV electricity generation surpasses hydropower and becomes largest renewable power source. 
• In 2030, wind-based generation surpasses hydropower. 
 
5.3.8. The rapid expansion of ever cheaper solar PV is expected to account for roughly half of global electricity demand 
growth to 2027, up from 40% in 2024. Globally, solar PV generation hit the 2 000 TWh mark in 2024, producing 7% 
of global electricity generation, up from 5% in 2023. 
5.3.9. Renewable energy sector is expected to focus on various areas, including advanced solar photovoltaic (PV)

5.4. India’s economic outlook: 
India's economic landscape has seen remarkable developments in recent times, showcasing its robust growth and 
strategic shifts: 
 
5.4.2 In the fiscal year 2025–26, India's economic growth is projected to rise to 6.7%, up from 6.4% in the previous year, 
positioning the country as one of the fastest-growing economy within the G20. Additionally, India has surpassed the 
Japan to become the f ourth largest global economy and overtaken China to emerge as the world's most populous 
nation. 
 
5.4.3 The pace of planned thermal capacity additions has decelerated significantly, reflecting a strategic shift by the 
Government of India (GoI) towards renewable energy. The GoI has set ambitious targets, aiming for a renewable 
power capacity of 500GW by 2030. This aggressive target underscores the policy makers’ strong commitment to 
sustainable energy. 
 
5.4.4 The power sector remains a pivotal area for attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into India, with the government 
allowing 100 percent FDI in this sector. This openness to foreign investment highlights the sector’s critical role in 
India’s economic strategy. 
 
5.4.5 The Union Budget 2025 -26 allocates  ₹26,549.38 crore  to the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE)  a 
massive 53.48% jump from last year’s revised  ₹17,298.44 crore, demonstrating the government’s enhanced focus 
on solar energy initiatives. 
5.4.6 According to the Economic Survey 2018-19, additional investments in renewable energy plants up to the year 2022 
were projected at approximately US$ 80 billion. For the period from 2023 to 2030, the required investment is

5.5. Power transmission network in India:   
5.5.1. The government's focus on providing electricity to rural areas has led to the T&D system being extended to remote 
villages. Total Transformation Capacity addition during FY 2024 -25 is 86433 MVA and the Total Transformation 
Capacity is 13.37 Lakh MVA. The total transmission network has increased from ~3.13 Lakhs Ckms in FY 15 to 
around ~4.81 Lakhs Ckms in FY24. 
5.5.2. Inter-state transmission has seen considerable growth in the past decade, which led to the creation of a     
synchronous National Grid, achievement of ‘One Nation -One Grid-One Frequency’, which has been an enabler for 
power markets in the country. The total inter-regional transmission capacity of the National Grid wa s 1,20,340 MW 
as on July,2025. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Source: NIP & CEA Executive Summary) 
 
5.5.3. As on January 2019 approx. 7.2% of total transmission network is owned by private players which showcase the 
need of more private sector participation in this space. India has been underinvested as far as transmission is 
concerned. 
5.5.4. PGCIL has remained the single largest player in inter regional power transmission capacity addition contributing to 
45%-50% of the total investment in the sector with a vast transmission network covering over 1,77,699 Ckm (circuit 
kilometers) of lines and 278 substations boasting a transformation capacity exceeding 5,27,446 MVA. 
5.5.5. Of the total capacity-addition projects in transmission during the 12th FYP, about 42% can be attributed to the state 
sector. The share of private sector in transmission line and substation additions since the beginning of 12th FYP is 
14% and 7%, respectiv ely, as the majority of high -capacity, long-distance transmission projects were executed by 
PGCIL and state transmission utilities during this period. 
5.5.6. In order to strengthen the power system and ensure free flow of power, significant investments would be required in 
the T&D segment. Moreover, commissioning of additional generation capacity, rising penetration of renewable 
energy, regional demand-supply mismatches, up gradation of existing lines, rising cross border power trading would 
necessitate huge investments in transmission sector in India. 
5.5.7. Over the past five years, India’s T&D sector has attracted significant investments to enhance grid reliability, reduce 
losses and support renewable energy integration. Between fiscals 2019 and 2024, the total investments in the 
transmission sector amounted to Rs 2,63,800 crore, of which Rs 3,000 crore was dedicated to GEC projects. Further, 
the total investments in the distribution sector amounted to Rs 4,22,400 crore, of which Rs 4,500 crore was dedicated 
to smart metering projects.

5.6. Factors Encouraging Investments in Power Transmission in India: 
5.6.1. Operational power transmission projects have minimal risks: 
In the project construction phase, transmission assets face execution risks including right of way, forest and 
environment clearances, increase in raw material prices etc. However, post commissioning, with the implementation 
of the Point of Connection (PoC) mechanism, there is limited offtake and price risk. Thus, operational transmission 
projects have annuity like cash flows and steady project returns. 
  
5.6.2. Availability based regime:  
As per the TSA, the transmission line developer is entitled to get an incentive amount in the ratio of the transmission 
charge paid or actually payable at the end of the contract year. Maintaining availability in excess of the targeted 
availability gives the relevant asset the right to claim incentives at pre-determined rates, ensuring an adequate upside 
to maintaining availability. 
 
5.6.3. Counter-party risk diversified: 
Given PAN-India aggregation of revenue among all TSPs and not asset specific billing, the counter party risk is 
diversified. If a particular beneficiary delays or defaults, the delay or shortfall is prorated amongst all the licensees. 
Thus, delays or defaults by a particular beneficiary will have limited impact, which will be proportionate to its share in 
overall ISTS. 
 
5.6.4 Payment security:  
The TSA includes an arrangement for payment security, which reduces under recovery of revenues. Payment 
security is available in terms of a revolving letter of credit of required amount that can be utilized to meet the revenue 
requirement in case of a shortfall. 
 
5.6.5 Collection risk offset owing to the presence of CTU: 
According to CERC (sharing of inter -state transmission charges and losses) regulations, 2010, CTU has been 
assigned the responsibility of carrying out activities including raising of transmission charge bills on behalf of all ISTS 
licensees, collecting the amount and disbursing the same to ISTS licenses. Thus, a private transmission licensee no 
longer needs to collect transmission charges from multiple DISCOMs for each transmission project. Instead, the 
transmission revenue payable to the licensee is disbursed by the CTU on a monthly basis. 
 
5.6.6 Increase in Pace of Awarding Projects under TBCB : 
Between 2010-11 and 2014-15, the pace of award of project was slow with only Rs. 180-190 billion (~USD 2.48-2.62 
billion) of projects being awarded. However, the pace of award of project has significantly increased. In fact, in 2015-
16, projects aggregating to ~Rs. 260 billion (~USD 3.58 billion) were awarded. Awarding of projects through TBCB 
picked up from fiscal 2017 onwards. In fact, between fiscals 2017 and 2020, projects worth ~312 billion have been 
awarded by BPCs (REC, PFC). 
 
5.6.7 Power Transmission infrastructure has better risk return profile as compared to other infrastructure projects: 
Returns from various infrastructure projects (other than transmission line projects) like roads, ports and power 
generation rely mostly on the operational performance of the assets, which in turn is dependent on factors where 
developers have limited control. For instance, in the roads sector (non-annuity based project) the company’s profits 
are dependent on collection of toll revenues, the port sector bears risk of cargo traffic, while in the case of power 
generation, it depends on availability of fuel and offtake by distribution companies while in the case of ISTS 
transmission projects the charges are independent of the total power transmitted through the transmission lines and 
hence factors such as volume, traffic do not fluctuate the revenues.

5.7 India is the most populous democracy in the world with a population of more than 1.4 billion. India’s GDP grew 6.2% 
in the third quarter of Financial Year 2025, following a 5.6% increase in the preceding quarter. The overall GDP 
growth for the fiscal year is projected at 6.5%. An efficient, resilient, and financially robust power sector is essential 
for the growth of the Indian economy. A series of reforms in the 1990s and the Electricity Act 2003 as amended from 
time to time have moved the Indian power sector towards being a competitive market with multiple buyers and sellers 
supported by regulatory and oversight bodies. 
 
 
 
              
• India is the 3rd  largest energy consuming country in the world. It stands 4th globally in renewable energy  installed 
capacity,4th wind power capacity and  3rd in solar Power capacity (as per IRENA RE Statistics 2025).The country 
has set an enhanced target at the COP26 of 500 GW of non -fossil fuelbased energy by 2030. This has been a key 
pledge under the Panchamrit Scheme. This is the world’s largest expansion plan in renewable energy. 
 
• India’s cumulative solar power capacity stood at  119.02 GW as of July 2025 . This includes  90.99 GW from 
ground-mounted solar plants , 19.88 GW from grid -connected rooftop systems , 3.06 GW from hybrid projects , 
and 5.09 GW from off -grid solar installations , reflecting the country’s diverse approach  to expanding renewable 
energy. 
India made 1,08,494 GWh of solar power, more than Japan’s 96,459 GWh, and became the world’s third -biggest 
solar energy producer. India’s solar module manufacturing capacity jumped from 38 GW to 74 GW during FY 2024–
25. 
 
• Electricity security has improved through the creation of one national power system and major investments in clean 
energy. India is now working on integrating higher shares of variable renewable energy into the energy mix. 
 
• India’s progress in the renewable energy sector reflects the country's focused policies and strategic planning under 
national leadership. As part of the pledge made at COP26, efforts are being directed towards reaching the target 
of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel electricity capacity by  2030. This commitment is seen as a key step in India's clean 
energy transition and its broader climate goals. 
 
5.8 Global Renewable Energy Outlook 
5.8.1 Under existing policies and market conditions, global renewable capacity is forecast to reach 7,300 GW by 2028. 
This growth trajectory would see global capacity increase to 2.5 times its current level by 2030, falling short of the 
tripling goal.  
5.8.2 The driving forces behind growth in renewable energy capacity includes robust policy support, energy security 
priorities and improved competitiveness against fossil fuels, outweighing challenges like higher costs and supply 
chain issues.  
5.8.3 Escalating electricity prices from the energy crisis prompted policymakers, particularly in Europe, to prioritize energy 
security and seek alternatives to imported fossil fuels. This shift favors solar PV, especially for quick installation of 
residential and commercial systems to meet surging requirement for renewable energy. 
5.8.4 The rapid expansion of ever cheaper solar PV is expected to account for roughly half of global electricity demand 
growth to 2027, up from 40% in 2024. Globally, solar PV generation hit the 2 000 TWh mark in 2024, producing 7% 
of global electricity generation, up from 5% in 2023. 
5.8.5 According to IEA’s Renewable 2024 Report, over the coming five years several renewable energy milestones are 
expected to be achieved: 
• In 2024, solar PV and wind generation together surpass hydropower generation.

5.11 Indian Solar Industry Outlook 
5.11.1 India is endowed with vast solar energy potential. About 5,000 trillion kWh per year energy is incident over India’s 
land area with most parts receiving 4-7 kWh per sq. m per day. Solar photovoltaic power can effectively be harnessed 
providing huge scalability in India. Solar also provides the ability to generate power on a distributed basis and enables 
rapid capacity addition with short lead times. Off -grid decentralized and low -temperature applications will be 
advantageous from a rural application perspec tive and meeting other energy needs for power, heating and cooling 
in both rural and urban areas. From an energy security perspective, solar is the most secure of all sources, since it 
is abundantly available. Theoretically, a small fraction of the total i ncident solar energy (if captured effectively) can 
meet the entire country’s power requirements.

5.11.2 National Institute of Solar Energy has assessed the Country’s solar potential of about 748 GW assuming 3% of the 
waste land area to be covered by Solar PV modules. Solar energy has taken a central place in India’s National Action 
Plan on Climate Change with National Solar Mission as one of the key Missions. National Solar Mission (NSM) was 
launched on 11th January, 2010. NSM is a major initiative of the Government of India with active participation from 
States to promote ecological sustainable growth while addressing India’s energy security challenges. It will also 
constitute a major contribution by India to the global effort to meet the challenges of climate change. The Mission’s 
objective is to establish India as a global leader in solar energy by creating the policy conditions for solar technology 
diffusion across the country as quickly as possible. The Mission targets installing 100 GW grid-connected solar power 
plants by the year 2022. This is in line with India’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribut ions (INDCs) target to 
achieve about 40 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non -fossil fuel based energy resources 
and to reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 percent from 2005 level by 2030.  
5.11.3 Recently, India stands 4th in solar PV deployment across the globe as on end of 2023. Solar power installed capacity 
has reached around 82 GW as on 31st March, 2024. Presently, solar tariff in India is very competitive and has 
achieved grid parity. 
5.11.4 As per the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) estimates, by 2029-30, the share of renewable energy generation would 
increase from 18% to 44%, while that of thermal is expected to reduce from 78% to 52%. The share of solar energy 
of overall RE installed ca pacity has increased from 7.5% in 2014 to around 39.7% in 2020, growing at a CAGR of 
53.7%.

5.12 Understanding key terms used in the solar industry 
5.12.1 Plant Load Factor (PLF) 
• The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission defines Plant Load Factor as a percentage of energy sent out by 
the power plant corresponding to installed capacity in that period. In the context of solar power plants, it reflects 
how efficiently the plant is utilizing its installed solar panel capacity to generate electricity over a specific period, 
often a year. In India, the Ministry of Power has, since the early 90s, used the Plant Load Factor as a metric to 
check the efficiency of a plant. A PLF norm has been set, and incentives are being given to those producers who 
produce power in excess of the norm.    
PLF= (Actual Energy Output / ( Installed Capacity*Total Time))*100      
where, Actual Energy Output: The total amount of energy generated by the solar power plant over the chosen time 
period.  
Installed Capacity: The maximum power output the solar panels are designed to produce under ideal conditions 
(rated capacity).  
Total Time: The duration for which the plant has been operating (usually measured in hours). 
• A low PLF is bad for the power plant as it indicates that the plant is not being used to its optimal capacity. This will 
increase the per -unit cost of the power thus produced, making it unattractive for purchase by DISCOMs. A higher 
PLF, on the other hand, will generate a greater total output which will reduce the cost per unit of energy generated. 
The higher the output, the lesser will be cost per unit. The additional energy produced would also result in an increase 
in revenue of the plant. 
• The average Plant Load Factor (PLF) for solar power plants can vary significantly depending on factors such as 
location, technology, weather conditions, maintenance practices, and the design of the solar plant. Generally, PLF 
for solar power plants is influenced by the availability of sunlight, which can vary based on the geographical location 
and weather patterns 
• On average, well-designed and efficiently operated solar power plants can achieve PLFs in the range of 15% to 25%. 
However, some high-performing solar installations can achieve even higher PLFs, exceeding 25%. 
• The trend in PLF in the solar industry has been improving over the years due to advancements in solar technology, 
improved design practices, better site selection, and increased experience in operation and maintenance. As 
technology has progressed, solar panels have become more efficient at converting sunlight into electricity, and better 
forecasting and monitoring systems have allowed operators to optimize their plants’ performance. Additionally, the 
growth of solar power capacity in regions with abundant sunlight has contributed to better overall PLF figures. 
• The PLF is not the same as the availability factor. The availability factor of a power plant is the amount of time that it 
is able to produce electricity over a certain period, divided by the amount of the time in the period. The availability of 
a power plant varies greatly depending on the type of design of the plant and how the plant is operated. The variability 
in the PLF is a result of seasonality, cloud covers, air pollution, and daily rotation of the earth, equipment efficiency 
losses, breakdown of transmission system and grid availability. 
Another factor that affects the PLF is the performance ratio of the plant. The performance ratio is a measure of the quality 
of a PV plant that is independent of location, and it therefore often described as a quality factor. The performance ratio 
(PR) describes the relationship between the actual and theoretical energy outputs of the PV plant.  The plant load factor 
is effective in measuring the performance of the power plants. Higher plant load factor at a plant indicates increased 
electricity generation

5.12.2 Solar Irradiation 
• Solar irradiance is the output of light energy from the sun that 
reaches the earth. It is measured in terms of the amount of sunlight 
that hits a square meter of a surface in one second. 
• Solar irradiance is a key factor in determining the energy output of 
solar power plants. By understanding the local solar irradiance 
conditions, engineers can design solar installations to capture the 
maximum amount of available sunlight. It also plays a crucial role in 
sizing solar panels, predicting energy production, and optimizing the 
orientation and tilt angles of panels to achieve higher energy yields.  
• In conclusion, solar irradiance is the foundation of solar energy 
generation. It’s the primary resource that solar panels capture and 
convert into electricity. Understanding local irradiance patterns is 
crucial for effective solar power plant design, operation, and energy 
yield optimization. 
• Solar irradiance is influenced by various factors, including:  
Time of Day: Irradiance is highest when the sun is directly overhead (solar noon) and decreases in the morning and 
evening. 
Season: Irradiance varies with the sun’s angle in the sky, which changes with the seasons.  
Geographical Location: Solar irradiance is generally higher near the equator and lower toward the poles. 
Weather Conditions: Cloud cover, air pollution, and atmospheric conditions can attenuate or scatter sunlight, affecting 
irradiance levels 
5.12.3 Degradation 
Solar panels convert solar radiation into electrical energy. The ability to do so declines steadily and irreversibly over 
time. The degradation may be in a cell or parts of a module or both. The ability to accurately predict power delivery 
over time is vit al to assess the credit risk profile of a project. The thumb rule in the industry is 0.50% system 
degradation per annum. Anything higher is considered a risk to cash generating ability and, by extension, to debt 
servicing ability. Degradation depends on many factors such as technology, panel quality. 
 
5.12.4  Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) 
Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) is the amount of terrestrial irradiance falling on a surface horizontal to the surface 
of the earth. GHI can be measured with a variety of instruments. The most common instrument used to measure GHI 
is called a pyranometer which has a hemispherical (180°) view angle. 
 
5.12.5 Performance Ratio (PR)  
The performance ratio (PR) is a metric used in the PV industry to measure the relationship between a plant’s actual 
and theoretical energy outputs. It’s calculated by dividing the energy generated by the plant (kWh), by the irradiance 
(kWh/m2), then multip lying by the active area of the PV module (m2), and finally multiplying by the PV module 
efficiency. The PR is stated as a percentage and is independent of location. 
 
5.12.6 Plant Availability Factor (PAF) 
Plant Availability Factor (PAF) is the ratio of a power plant’s actual operating hours to its scheduled operating hours 
during a given period. In a solar PV power plant, PAF is an important factor that depends on the functioning of its 
components and grid regulation. A high PAF indicates that the plant is operating efficiently and reliably, while a low 
PAF can lead to higher downtime and revenue loss.

5.12.7 Deviation Settlement Mechanism Charges (DSM Charges) 
Any demand-supply imbalance of electricity leads to a fluctuation in the grid frequency from the standard value, which 
is set at 50 Hertz (Hz) in India. A significant drop or rise in frequency could lead to a power system blackout. 
Therefore, the Indian Electricity Grid Code (IEGC) 2010 restricts the operational frequency between 49.90 to 50.05 
Hz. To maintain the frequency within the band, the power distribution companies must predict demand accurately 
and schedule supply accordingly. Deviation Settlement Mechanism (DSM) is a regulatory mechanism by which grid 
stability is achieved by imposing penalty and incentives for over drawl/injection or under drawl/injection from the 
schedule. DSM is a frequency linked mechanism. It is not related to any market conditions. 
 
India’s solar power tariffs are expected to touch ₹2.6 -2.7 per unit due to the increase in the goods and services tax 
(GST) on renewable energy equipment and a proposed customs duty on imported solar modules, according to Crisil 
Ratings. According to a rec ent research report released by India Ratings, the decline in solar tariffs is being driven 
by (a) Advancement in panel designs enabling a higher capacity utilisation factor (CUF); (b) Lower financing costs 
due to declining interest rates and (c) Lower capital cost/MW of around ₹ 40 million/MW due to declining Panel costs 
as can be seen in the below chart:  
 
5.13      Challenges 
• There are several challenges to overcome, including regulatory and policy inconsistencies, changes in duties, and 
payment delays by distribution companies (DISCOMs), among others. 
• Payment disputes by DISCOMs were also rampant, slowing down any progress made by developers. The 
government’s introduction of credit mechanisms and amendments to policies has done little in the way of negating 
these issues. A 25% Safeguard Duty (SGD) was a nnounced on solar cell and module imports from China and 
Malaysia between July 30, 2018, and July 29, 2019. The duty was set at 25% for the first year, followed by a phased 
down approach for the second year, with the rate set to be lowered by 5% every six months until July 2020. 
• Manufacturers of solar modules, ancillary products, system integrators, and raw material suppliers in the solar 
photovoltaic space complained that the government’s protectionist policies were increasing costs for smaller local 
manufacturers and had loophol es.Tender cancellations, tariff re -negotiations by a few states had increased the 
uncertainty of some of the large-scale projects and hence delayed their executions.

5.14 Introduction: 
• The India Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) market is valued at USD 3.5 billion, based on a five -year 
historical analysis. This market has been driven primarily by the rapid expansion of renewable energy projects 
across the country, which require efficient storage solutions for grid stabilization and peak load management. The 
Indian government's emphasis on increasing renewable energy capacity, especially solar and wind, has 
significantly boosted the demand for battery energy storage solutions. Addition ally, advancements in battery 
technology, such as the declining cost of lithium-ion batteries, have contributed to the increasing adoption of BESS. 
• The Indian government has launched the Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) Scheme, which aims to develop 
4,000 MWh of battery energy storage system projects by 2030-31 with an initial budget of USD 1.129 billion. This 
initiative is part of India's broader goal to achieve 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. The BESS 
Scheme is a crucial part of India's broader goal to achieve 500 GW of renewab le energy capacity by 2030. This 
target is a significant step towards reducing India's emission intensity b y 33-35% from 2005 levels by 2030 and 
achieving 40% electricity generation from non-fossil fuels. 
• Key cities and regions leading in battery energy storage systems include Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi, and states 
like Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. These regions dominate the market due to their rapid industrialization, urbanization, 
and large-scale renewable energ y projects. Mumbai and Bangalore are home to several technology companies 
and energy innovators, while Tamil Nadu and Gujarat have extensive solar and wind power generation capacities, 
necessitating efficient energy storage systems for grid stability. 
• India has set a target to achieve 50% cumulative installed capacity from non -fossil fuel-based energy resources 
by 2030 and has pledged to reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by 45% by 2030, based on 2005 levels. The 
incorporation of a significant amount of variable and intermittent Renewable Energy into the energy mix presents 
a challenge for maintaining grid stability and uninterrupted power supply. The challenge with Renewable Energy 
sources arises due to their varying nature with time, climate, sea son or geographic location. Energy Storage 
Systems (ESS) can be used for storing available energy from Renewable Energy and further can be used during 
peak hours of the day. The various benefits of Energy Storage are help in bringing down the variability of generation 
in RE sources, improving grid stability, enabling energy/ peak shifting, providing ancillary support services, enabling 
larger renewable energy integration, brings down peak deficit and peak tariffs, reduction of carbon emissions, 
deferral of transmission and distribution capex, energy arbitrage etc. 
• As per National Electricity Plan (NEP) 2023 of Central Electricity Authority (CEA), the energy storage capacity 
requirement is projected to be 82.37 GWh (47.65 GWh from PSP and 34.72 GWh from BESS) in year 2026 -27. 
This requirement is further expected to i ncrease to 411.4 GWh (175.18 GWh from PSP and 236.22 GWh from 
BESS) in year 2031-32. Further, CEA has also projected that by the year 2047, the requirement of energy storage 
is expected to increase to 2380 GWh (540 GWh from PSP and 1840 GWh from BESS), due  to the addition of a 
larger amount of renewable energy in light of the net zero emissions targets set for 2070. A long -term trajectory 
for Energy Storage Obligations (ESO) has also been notified by the Ministry of Power to ensure that sufficient 
storage capacity is available with obligated entities. As per the trajectory, the ESO shall gradually increase from 
1% in FY 2023 -24 to 4% by FY 2029 -30, with an annual increase of 0.5%. This obligation shall be treated as 
fulfilled only when at least 85% of the total energy stored is procured from Renewable Energy sources on an annual 
basis. 
• There are several energy storage technologies available, broadly – mechanical, thermal, electrochemical, electrical 
and chemical storage systems, as shown below:

5.15 Recent Developments 
• Government has given go ahead for inviting the expression of interest for installation of 1,000 MWh Battery Energy 
Storage System (BESS) as a pilot project. This is the joint effort of both Ministry of New and renewable energy and 
Ministry of Power who have been working on this to provide a road map for the installation of the energy storage 
system in the country. 
• In order to support the ambitious goal of achieving 450 GW renewable energy target of Ministry of New and 
renewable energy by 2030, it is important that it gets duly supported with installation of energy storage systems 
(battery energy storage system, hydro pump storage plants etc.). 
• Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), a CPSU under Ministry of New and renewable energy, has called for 
the expression of interest for procurement of 1,000 MWh BESS. This will be published along with the RFS bid 
document and the draft comprehensive guideline for procurement and utilization of BESS as a part of generation, 
transmission and distribution assets and with all ancillary services.  
• Going forward, India plans to use energy storage system under following business cases:- 
i. Renewable energy along with the energy storage system. 
ii. Energy storage system as grid element to maximize the use of transmission system and strengthening grid 
stability and also to save investment in the augmentation of transmission infrastructure. 
iii. Storage as an asset for balancing services and flexible operation.   The system operator i.e. load dispatchers 
(RLDCs and SLDCs) may use storage system for frequency control and balancing services to manage the 
inherent uncertainty/variations in the load due to un-generation. 
iv. Storage for distribution system i.e. it may be placed at the load centre to manage its peak load and other 
obligations.

6. Valuation Methodology and Approach 
 
6.1 The present valuation exercise is being undertaken in order to derive the fair EV of the SPVs. 
6.2 The valuation exercise involves selecting a method suitable for the purpose of valuation, by exercise of judgment by 
the valuers, based on the facts and circumstances as applicable to the business of the company to be valued. 
6.3 There are three generally accepted approaches to valuation: 
(a) “Cost” approach 
(b) “Market” approach 
(c) “Income” approach 
 
6.4 Cost Approach 
The cost approach values the underlying assets of the business to determine the business value. This valuation 
method carries more weight with respect to holding companies than operating companies. Also, cost value 
approaches are more relevant to the extent that a significant portion of the assets are of a nature that could be 
liquidated readily if desired. 
Net Asset Value (“NAV”) Method 
The NAV Method under Cost Approach considers the assets and liabilities, including intangible assets and contingent 
liabilities. The Net Assets, after reducing the dues to the preference shareholders, if any, represent the value of a 
company. 
The NAV Method is appropriate in a case where the main strength of the business is its asset backing rather than its 
capacity or potential to earn profits. This valuation approach is also used in cases where the firm is to be liquidated, 
i.e. it does not meet the “Going Concern” criteria. 
As an indicator of the total value of the entity, the NAV method has the disadvantage of only considering the status 
of the business at one point in time.  
Additionally, NAV does not properly take into account the earning capacity of the business or any intangible assets 
that have no historical cost. In many aspects, NAV represents the minimum benchmark value of an operating 
business. 
 
6.5 Market Approach  
Under the Market approach, the valuation is based on the market value of the company in case of listed companies, 
and comparable companies trading or transaction multiples for unlisted companies. The Market approach generally 
reflects the investors perception about the true worth of the company. 
 
Comparable Companies Multiples (“CCM”) Method 
The value is determined on the basis of multiples derived from valuations of comparable companies, as manifest in 
the stock market valuations of listed companies. This valuation is based on the principle that market valuations, 
taking place between informed buyers and informed sellers, incorporate all factors relevant to valuation.  Relevant 
multiples need to be chosen carefully and adjusted for differences between the circumstances. 
 
Comparable Transactions Multiples (“CTM”) Method 
Under the CTM Method, the value is determined on the basis of multiples derived from valuations of similar 
transactions in the industry. Relevant multiples need to be chosen carefully and adjusted for differences between the 
circumstances. Few of such multiples are EV/Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & Amortization 
(“EBITDA”) multiple and EV/Revenue multiple. 
 
Market Price Method 
Under this method, the market price of an equity share of the company as quoted on a recognized stock exchange 
is normally considered as the fair value of the equity shares of that company where such quotations are arising from 
the shares being regularly and freely traded. The market value generally reflects the investors perception about the 
true worth of the company.

                   Fair Enterprise Valuation of SPVs

6.6 Income Approach  
The income approach is widely used for valuation under "Going Concern" basis. It focuses on the income generated 
by the company in the past as well as its future earning capability. The Discounted Cash Flow Method under the 
income approach seeks to arrive at a valuation based on the strength of future cash flows.  
 
DCF Method 
Under DCF Method value of a company can be assessed using the Free Cash Flow to Firm Method (“FCFF”) or Free 
Cash Flow to Equity Method (“FCFE”). Under the DCF method, the business is valued by discounting its free cash 
flows for the explicit forecast period and the perpetuity value thereafter. The free cash flows represent the cash 
available for distribution to both, the owners and creditors of the business. The free cash flows in the explicit period 
and those in perpetuity are discounted by the WACC. The WACC, based on an optimal vis-à-vis actual capital 
structure, is an appropriate rate of discount to calculate the present value of future cash flows as it considers equity-
debt risk by incorporating debt-equity ratio of the firm. 
 
The perpetuity (terminal) value is calculated based on the business’ potential for further growth beyond the explicit 
forecast period. The “Constant Growth Model” is applied, which implies an expected constant level of growth for 
perpetuity in cash flows over the last year of forecast period. 
 
The discounting factor (rate of discounting the future cash flows) reflects not only the time value of money, but also 
the risk associated with the business’ future operations. The EV (aggregate of the present value of explicit period 
and terminal period cash flows) so derived, is further reduced by the value of debt, if any, (net of cash and cash 
equivalents) to arrive at value to the owners of the business.  
 
Conclusion on Valuation Approach 
6.7 It is pertinent to note that the valuation of any company or its assets is inherently imprecise and is subject to certain 
uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are difficult to predict and are beyond my control. In performing my 
analysis, I have made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance and general business and 
economic conditions, many of which are beyond the control of the SPVs. In addition, this valuation will fluctuate with 
changes in prevailing market conditions, and prospects, financial and otherwise, of the SPVs, and other factors which 
generally influence the valuation of companies and their assets. 
 
6.8 The goal in selection of valuation approaches and methods for any business is to find out the most appropriate 
method under particular circumstances on the basis of available information. No one method is suitable in every 
possible situation. Before selecting the appropriate valuation approach and method, I have considered various 
factors, inter-alia, the basis and premise of current valuation exercise, purpose of valuation exercise, respective 
strengths and weaknesses of the possible valuation approach and methods, availability of adequate inputs or 
information and its reliability and valuation approach and methods considered by the market participants.

                   Fair Enterprise Valuation of SPVs

6.9 Cost Approach 
In the present case, since the SPVs have entered into TSA/PPA, the revenue of the SPVs are pre-determined for 
the life of the projects. In such scenario, the true worth of the business is reflected in its future earning capacity 
rather than the cost of the project. Considering that DPTL, IPTL, KTCO, NRSS II, GPTL II, RKPTL, GBPL and 
RBPL projects are currently under-construction and TL SitamauSS is currently being utilised for captive 
consumption and in absence of any specific projections, I have considered NAV method for the purpose of 
valuation of these SPVs.  
 
6.10 Market Approach 
The present valuation exercise is to arrive at the Fair EV of the SPVs engaged in the power transmission business 
for a specific tenure. Further, the tariff revenue expenses are very specific to the SPVs depending on the nature of 
their geographical location, stage of project, terms of profitability. In the absence of any exactly comparable listed 
companies with characteristics and parameters similar to that of the SPVs, I have not considered CCM method in 
the present case. In the absence of adequate details about the Comparable Transactions, I was unable to apply the 
CTM method. Currently, the equity shares of the SPVs are not listed on any recognized stock exchange of India. 
Hence, I was unable to apply market price method. 
 
6.11 Income Approach 
Currently, each of the SPVs except DPTL, IPTL, KTCO, NRSS II, GPTL II, RKPTL, GBPL and RBPL are completed 
and are revenue generating SPVs. The cash flows of the SPVs for the projected period are driven by the contracts 
entered by the SPVs as on date like the TSA, O&M Agreements, etc. The revenues of the projects are defined for 
35 years under the TSA. Hence, the growth potential of the SPVs and the true worth of its business would be reflected 
in its future earnings potential and therefore, DCF method under the income approach has been considered as an 
appropriate method for the present valuation exercise for all the SPVs except DPTL, IPTL, KTCO, NRSS II, GPTL II, 
RKPTL, GBPL, RBPL and TL SitamauSS as explained above in the Cost approach. 
In the present exercise, my objective is to determine the Fair Enterprise Value of the SPV as per the DCF Method. 
EV is described as the total value of the equity in a business plus the value of its debt and debt related liabilities, 
minus any cash and cash equivalents to meet those liabilities. Accordingly, in the present case, I have considered it 
appropriate to consider cash flows at FCFF (Free Cash Flow to Firm) level i.e., cash flows that are available to all 
the providers of capital (equity shareholde rs, preference shareholders and lenders). Therefore, cash flows required 
to service lenders and preference shareholders such as interest, dividend, repayment of principal amount and even 
additional fund raising are not considered in the calculation of FCFF. 
 
While carrying out this engagement, I have relied extensively on the information made available to me by the 
Investment Manager. I have considered projected financial statement of the SPV as provided by the Investment 
Manager. I have not tested individual assumptions or attempted to substantiate the veracity or integrity of such 
assumptions in relation to the forward -looking financial information. However, I have made sufficient enquiries to 
satisfy myself that such information has been prepared on a reason able basis. Notwithstanding anything above, I 
cannot provide any assurance that the forward-looking financial information will be representative of the results which 
will actually be achieved during the cash flow forecast period. 
 
The following are the major steps I have considered in order to arrive at the EV of the SPV as per the DCF Method:  
1. Determination of Free Cash Flows to Firm which included: 
a) Obtaining the financial projections to determine the cash flows expected to be generated by the SPV from the  
Investment Manager;

7 Valuation of the SPVs 
7.1 The key assumptions for transmission revenue, incentives and penalty of the SPVs, are as follows: 
 
               Transmission Revenue:  
Power transmission projects, including the SPVs, earn revenue from electricity transmission tariffs pursuant to TSAs 
read with the Tariff Adoption Order (“TAO”) passed by CERC in accordance with the Electricity Act. These SPVs 
receive availability based tariffs under the TSAs irrespective of the actual quantum of power transmitted through the 
line. The tariff for the SPVs is contracted for the period of the relevant TSA, which is up to 35 years from the 
scheduled commissioning date, other than ENICL and JKTPL, which is for 25 years. 
 
7.1.1 The majority of the SPVs have entered into TSAs with long -term transmission customers to set up projects on a 
BOOM or BOO basis and to provide transmission services on a long -term basis to such customers on the terms 
and conditions contained in the TSAs. The term of each TSA is 35 years from the scheduled commercial date of 
operation of the applicable project, (other than for ENICL and JKTPL, which are for 25 years each) unless terminated 
earlier in accordance with the terms of the TSA. The TSAs provide for, among other things, details and procedures 
for project execution, development and construction, operation and maintenance. 
 
7.1.2 Tariffs under these TSAs are billed and collected pursuant to the 'Point of Connection' (PoC) mechanism, a 
regulatory payment pooling system offered to interstate transmission system (ISTS) such as the systems operated 
by majority of the SPVs. Under the Po C mechanism, payments are made to a central payment pool and the 
proceeds are distributed proportionately to all transmission services providers, such as the SPVs. 
 
7.1.3 The tariff rates are comprised of a fixed non -escalable charge, a variable escalable charge, and incentives for 
maintaining targeted availability. 
• Non Escalable Transmission Revenue: The Non-Escalable Transmission Revenue remains fixed for the entire 
life of the project. I have corroborated the revenue considered in the financial projections with the respective 
TSA read with TAO and documents provided to us by the Investment Manager. 
• In case of certain SPVs, the transmission lines could not be commissioned on their scheduled commissioning 
dates due to change in law and force majeure events, including the amendment of Forest Guidelines, delay in 
grant of forest clearance, delay in recei ving authorisation under Section 164 of the Electricity Act, delay in 
allotment of land for the construction, change in applicable rates of taxes, etc. These delays when acknowledged 
by CERC, the scheduled commercial operation date gets revised accordingly . Further to compensate for the 
loss in revenue, the SPVs file a tariff revision petition with CERC, pursuant to which the CERC once satisfied 
may agree to the claim in respect of cost escalation. 
 
In the present case, as represented us by the Investment Manager following SPVs have filed for incremental 
revenue (increase in tariff amount):

SPVs CERC 
Order Description 
MTL and BDTCL Received 
Incremental Revenue is considered in MTL and BDTCL due to change in law 
and/ or force majeure, mainly due to introduction of GST in FY 2017, the 
additional expenditure incurred due to such change in law shall be 
reimbursed as per the CERC order dated 11th March 2019 and 20th October 
2020 respectively. 
ENICL Received 
To compensate for the damages sustained by ENICL, an increase in revenue 
charges was approved as per various CERC orders detailed below: 
 
Purnea–Biharsharif Line: Due to obstruction at Mahenderpur village and 
flooding in Bihar, CERC, through its order dated 24th August 2016, granted 
compensation by allowing an increase in both Non-Escalable and Escalable 
revenue by approximately 6.18%. 
 
Bongaigaon–Siliguri Line: In light of delays caused by the pending forest 
clearance, riots in Kokrajhar, and bandh in Assam, CERC, through its order 
dated 13th September 2017, approved a compensation by increasing the 
Non-Escalable revenue by approximately 3.73%. 
 
Change in Law During Construction: Further, due to a Change in Law 
event during the construction phase, CERC, via its order dated 19th 
September 2018, allowed an increase in Non-Escalable Transmission 
Charges by approximately 1.09%. 
JTCL,KhTL,OGPTL, 
NRSS, PKTCL, 
GPTL and NERTL 
Not 
Required 
According to the Investment Manager, the claim for incremental revenue by 
the respective SPVs arises from the additional tax liability due to the 
introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation cess. This 
claim does not require a separate CERC order, as it is covered under the 
scope of the CERC order dated 17th December 2018. 
Additionally, due to significant changes in law during the construction period, 
CERC, through its order dated 19th May 2024, approved an increase in Non-
Escalable Transmission Charges for NERTL at a rate of approximately 
2.39%. 
Furthermore, NERTL and NRSS have been granted increases in Non-
Escalable Transmission Charges on account of force majeure events, at 
rates of approximately 4.76% and 0.26%, respectively. 
 
Accordingly, I have received computation of such incremental revenue from the Investment Manager. 
 
• Escalable Transmission Revenue:  
Escalable Transmission Revenue is the revenue component where the revenue is duly escalated based on the 
rationale as provided in the respective TSA read with TAO and documents provided to me by the Investment 
Manager. The escalation, as presented to us by the investment manager, is to mainly compensate for the 
inflation factor. 
 
• Transmission Revenue for JKTPL:  
The revenues generated by intra-state transmission assets (being, JKTPL) are not dependent on a regulatory 
order and are dependent on tariffs as determined in terms of the relevant TSA, and such intra -state 
transmission assets recover tariffs equivalent to a base unitary charge which is subject to annual revisions. The 
transmission revenue of JKTPL comprises of Unitary Charges (“UC”) as provided in the TSA. Unitary Charges 
(“UC”): Unitary Charges is the monthly fee for transmission services as per the TSA,  which is duly escalated 
based on the Wholesale Price Index series 2011-12 (restated with 2004-05 series) to arrive at the indexed UC 
rationale as provided in the respective TSA read with TAO and documents provided to me by the Investment 
Manager. 
 
• Transmission Revenue for PrKTCL, PTCL-II, KTL-II, KTL-III and KNTL-II:  
The transmission revenue of PrKTCL , PTCL-II, KTL-II, KTL-III and KNTL-II are calculated on cost plus basis 
as per the extant provisions of the CERC Tariff Regulations, 2024 and it comprises of depreciation, interest on 
loan, return on equity, interest on working capital and O&M expenses. The same has been determined on the 
basis of the mechanism provided under the extant provisions.

7.1.4 Incentives:  
As provided in the respective TSA, if the annual availability exceeds 98%, the SPVs shall be entitled to an annual 
incentive as provided in TSA. Provided no incentives shall be payable above the availability of 99.75%. Based on 
the past track record of the  asset and the general industry standard, the annual availability shall be above 98% 
where the SPVs shall be entitled to the incentives as provided in the respective TSA. 
For KTCO, if the annual availability exceeds 98 .5%, the SPVs shall be entitled to an annual incentive as provided 
in TSA. Provided no incentives shall be payable above the availability of 99.75%.   
For JKTPL, when the availability exceeds the Normative Availability of 98%, incentive is received based on pro rata 
basis in same proportion as UC bears to Normative Availability. Further, for JKTPL, as per its TSA, if the 
transmission loss for any month is less than the normative loss, then the SPV will receive an incentive. As provided 
in the TSA, if the annual availability exceeds 98%, the SPV shall be entitled to an annual incentive as provided in 
TSA. Provided no incentives shall be payable above the availability of 100%.  
For PrKTCL  and PTCL -II when the actual availability exceeds the Normative Availability of 98.5%, incentive is 
received by PrKTCL  and PTCL-II. Incentive is computed on pro rata basis in same proportion as Transmission 
Revenue bears to Normative Availability. No incentive in case of availability beyond 99.75%. As represented to us 
by the Investment Manager, the annual availability of PrKTCL shall be above 98.5% where it shall be entitled to the 
incentives as provided in the CERC Tariff Regulations, 2019. 
7.1.5 Penalty:  
If the annual availability in a contract year falls below 95%, the SPVs shall be liable for an annual penalty as provided 
in the TSA. Based on my analysis, in the present case, it is assumed that the annual availability will not fall below 
95% and hence, penalty is not considered in the financial projections.  
For JKTPL, when the Availability in any month is less than the 98%, the UC for such month shall be proportionately 
reduced and such reduction shall be multiplied by a factor of 1.5 by way of penalty. If the transmission loss of JKTPL 
for any month is more than the normative loss, penalty will be payable by JKTPL as per the computations provided 
in the TSA. The reliability of the system capacity in an accounting year shall be measured in terms of the number 
of forced Outages occurring on the individual eleme nts of the System Capacity in successive Reliability 
Measurement Units (“RMU”). The cumulative incentive or penalty shall be determined with reference to normative 
availability within 30 days from close of every year. 
7.1.6 Expenses:  
Expenses are estimated by the Investment Manager for the projected period based on the inflation rate as 
determined for the SPVs. I have relied on the projections provided by the Investment Manager. 
 
• Operations & Maintenance (“O&M”):  O&M expenditure is estimated by the Investment Manager for the 
projected period based on the inflation rate as determined for the SPVs. The Investment Manager has projected 
expenses to be incurred for the O&M of the SPVs including, but not limited to, tra nsmission line maintenance 
expenses, rates and taxes, legal and professional fees and other general and administration expenses. I have 
relied on the projections provided by Investment Manager on the O&M expenses for the projected period. 
 
• Insurance Expenses: I understand from the Investment Manager that the insurance expenses of the SPVs 
are not reasonably expected to inflate for the projected period. I have relied on the projections provided by the 
Investment Manager on the insurance expenses for the projected period. 
 
O&M expenses are projected to escalate ~2.5% to 5% year on year basis. PM fees is observed to be escalating on 
the same basis ~2.5% to 5% p.a in line with operating expenses (excluding Insurance and any expense which is 
statutory in nature). 
(Refer Appendix 6 and 10 for detailed working) 
 
7.1.7 Depreciation:  
For calculating depreciation as per Income Tax Act for the projected period, I have considered depreciation rate as 
specified in the Income Tax Act and WDV as provided by the Investment Manager. The book depreciation has been 
provided by the Investment Manager till the life of the SPVs  for all the projects except  RTBP projects. The book 
depreciation for RTBP projects has been calculated using the rates and methodology notified vide CERC Tariff 
regulations, 2024.  
 
7.1.8 Capex:  
As represented by the Investment Manager, regarding the maintenance capex, the same has already been 
considered in the Operations & Maintenance expenditure for the projected period and regarding the expansion 
capex, the SPVs are not expected to incur any Capex in the projected period except for BDTCL and PTCL. 
 
7.1.9 Tax and Tax Incentive:  
As per the discussions with the Investment Manager, Section 115BAA of Income Tax Act,196 has been considered 
for the projected period of the SPVs (except PrKTCL) for the current valuation exercise, which inter alia does not 
provide benefits of additional depreciation and section 80 -IA and Sec 115 JB. Accordingly, the base corporate tax 
rate o f 22% (with applicable surcharge and cess) is considered. As per the discussions with the Investment 
Manager, PrKTCL will continue with old tax regime and avail the benefits of additional depreciation, section 115 JB

and section 80-IA. Post complete utilization of MAT Credit, PrKTCL will shift to the new tax regime as per the Income 
Tax Act. 
 
7.1.10 Working Capital:  
The Investment Manager has represented the working capital requirement of the SPVs for the projected period. The 
operating working capital assumptions for the projections provided by the Investment Manager comprises of prepaid 
expense, security deposit, trade receivables, trade payables and others.  
 
7.1.11 Terminal Period Cash Flows:  
Terminal value represents the present value at the end of explicit forecast period of all subsequent cash flows to 
the end of the life of the asset or into perpetuity if the asset has an indefinite life. 
 
I understand, based on the representation of the Investment Manager, that all the SPVs except JKTPL are expected 
to generate cash flow even after the expiry of concession period as the projects are either on BOOM or BOO model 
and the ownership will remain with the respective SPVs even after the expiry of concession period. The value of 
SPVs at the end of the concession period may be dependent on the expected renewal/extension of concession 
period with limited capital expenditure or the estimated salvage value the assets of the SPVs can fetch. 
Considering the estimation uncertainty involved in determining the salvage value and basis my discussion with the 
Investment Manager on the cash flow estimates for the period after the concession period, I found it appropriate to 
derive terminal period val ue, which represents the present value at the end of explicit forecast period/concession 
period of all subsequent cash flows to the end of the life of the asset or into perpetuity if the asset has an indefinite 
life, based on the perpetuity value derivation / Gordon growth model with 0% terminal growth rate. Accordingly, for 
the terminal period (i.e. after the expiry of 35 years), a terminal growth rate of 0% has been applied on cash flows 
based on Investment Manager’s estimate for all the SPVs, other than ENICL. 
 
ENICL was one of the earlier projects awarded to the Sponsor through the process of Tariff Based Competitive 
Bidding (“TBCB”) on 7th January 2010. The terms of tariff for ENICL are governed by the CERC Order (“Tariff 
Adoption Order”) dated 28th October 2010, read with the TSA. As per the Tariff Adoption Order, the tariff adopted 
for the transmission system is valid for a period of 25 years. The tariff of the transmission assets beyond the period 
of 25 years will be governed by the provisions of clause (4) o f Regulation 13 of CERC (Procedure, Terms and 
Conditions for grant of Transmission Licence and other related matters) Regulations (“CERC Licence Regulations”) 
dated 26th May 2009 as amended from time to time. Hence, in case of ENICL, based on the extant pr ovisions of 
the CERC Regulations, in case of transmission assets that have been awarded on the basis of competitive bidding 
under Section 63 of the Electricity Act, as in the case of the ENICL, the tariff beyond the initial period of TSA shall 
be determined based on various factors, inter -alia, basis of norms prevalent during the period in which the TSA is 
due to expire. Considering the extant provisions of CERC Regulations, the Investment Manager has represented 
me a post-tax return on equity of 15% on estimated equity can be considered as a cash flow for period after end of 
TSA period. Accordingly, the Investment Manager has provided me an estimated terminal cash flow to be expected 
after the end of TSA period in case of ENICL. I have considered the same for my valuation analysis. 
 
I understand from the representation of the Investment Manager that JKTPL will generate cash flow even after the 
expiry of concession period of 25 years, as the project has an extension clause stating a further increase in the 
license tenure for 10 years. Since the project is based on DBOFT model the ownership will not remain with the SPV 
after the expiry of the extended period. Based on my discussions with the Investment Manager, I understand it is a 
highly probable that JKTPL will receive an extension of 10 years as per terms of TSA. Hence, I have considered an 
extension of 10 years for the JKTPL project without assigning any value to the Terminal period. Accordingly, I have 
projected the revenue and thus the Valuation working till FY 46, considering the i mpact of extension of 10 years in 
the TSA post the end the Concession Period. 
 
 
7.1.12 True up petition for PrKTCL:  
I understand that PrKTCL has filed petition with CERC for Approval of Truing up of Transmission Tariff for 2014-19 
Tariff Block and Determination of Transmission Tariff for 2019 -24 Tariff Block for transmission line elements and 
final order is reserved by CERC. The Truing up of Transmission Tariff for 2019-24 Tariff Block and determination of 
Transmission Tariff for 2024 -29 Tariff Block will be filed once reserved petition order is received from CERC. The 
Investment Manager has informed me that the projections for PrKTCL are based on the above mentioned petition. 
Thus, as per the CERC Tariff Regulations, 2024, revenue components, interest during construction, incidental 
expenses during construction, spares, interest amount and additional capital expenditure are expected to be trued 
up as per the final true up order of CERC. This truing up may have a bearing on the transmission revenue of PrKTCL 
for the projected period.

 The key assumptions for Solar and CER Revenue of the SPVs, are as follows: 
I have estimated the fair EV of the SPVs using the DCF Method. While carrying out this engagement, I have relied 
extensively on the information made available to me by the Investment Manager. I have considered projected 
financial statements of the SPVs as provided by the Investment Manager. 
Valuation  
The key assumptions of the projections provided to us by the Investment Manager are divided into two parts:  
A. Key Assumptions for cash flows dependent on the terms of the respective PPAs of the SPVs  
B. Key Assumptions for cash flows pertaining to Certified Emission Reduction (“CER”) Units. 
 
(A)  Key assumptions for Cash Flows dependent on terms of PPA are as follows: 
Cash Flows falling under this category are mainly driven by the revenue and operations required as per the terms of 
the respective SPVs PPAs, O&M Agreements, etc 
7.2.1. Revenue from sale of electricity units: 
The revenues generated by the SPV are correlated to the amount of electricity generated, which in turn is dependent 
upon available irradiance and weather conditions. Irradiance and weather conditions have natural variations from 
season to season and from y ear to year and may also change permanently because of climate  change or other 
factors. The total kilowatt hour units expected to be generated annually during the tenure of PPA are estimated using 
budgeted plant load factors based on inter-alia the forecasted irradiance and weather conditions. 
The contractual tariff rates are applied to this annual estimate to determine the total estimated revenue over the term 
of the PPA. The Plant Load Factor (“PLF”) is the ratio of the actual output of a solar power plant over the reporting 
period to their potential output if it were possible for them to operate at full rated capacity. I have relied on the same.  
In the present valuation, the technical team of the Investment Manager has prepared the PLF estimates for the 
projected period basis historical performance after considering the variance on account of seasonal factors and any 
one-time instances or events. I have relied on the projections provided by the Investment Manager for the projected 
PLF of the SPVs. I have corroborated the assumptions made by the Investment Manager in relation to the projected 
PLF of the SPVs with an independent technical report.

Solar Edge, ISPL 1 and ISPL 2. The CERC order, entitled Solar Edge, ISPL 1 and ISPL 2 to receive monthly annuity 
payments until Mar’29, Mar’33 and Mar’33 respectively is relied upon for this revenue. 
 
7.2.3. Tariff Upside in relation to GGEL: 
 
In its order dated 26th July, 2022, APTEL directed CERC to devise a mechanism for an upward revision of the tariff 
in the case of GGEL, in light of the lower actual DNI compared to the projected DNI. 
Pursuant to this order, the Investment Manager has submitted a request to CERC and NVVN for an incremental tariff 
increase of INR 4.15 per unit, applicable from COD through the end of the project’s life. The Investment Manager 
anticipates receiving the revised tariff (with retrospective effect) starting from FY 2027. 
As per the transaction documents between GGEL and the erstwhile sellers, 75% of the incremental tariff cash flows 
(net of tax) actually received shall be paid to the erstwhile sellers. Additionally, the documents stipulate that GGEL 
is also obligated to pay 75% of the net present value (NPV) of future incremental tariff-related cash flows (net of tax), 
calculated using a 12% discount rate. 
 
7.2.4. Expenses: 
 
I have relied on the projections provided by the Investment Manager for expenses and have checked the 
reasonableness of the same, by analyzing the past trend in expenses and the expenses projected by the 
SPVs.  
1. Operations & Maintenance (“O&M”): O&M expenditure is estimated by the Investment Manager for the projected 
period on the basis of the O&M Agreement entered by the SPV with an adequate escalation considered by the 
Investment Manager.  The Investment Manager has escalated these costs by approximately ~ 2-4% p.a.  The 
Investment Manager has provided the estimated O&M costs for the projected period and I have corroborated the 
said expenses with O&M Contract signed. 
2. Lease Charge: The amount of lease charges is corroborated with the lease agreements entered into by the SPV. I 
have relied on the projected lease expenses working and Lease agreements provided by the Investment Manager.  
3. Insurance Expenses: I understand from the Investment Manager that the insurance expenses of the SPVs are not 
reasonably expected to inflate for the projected period. I have relied on the projections provided by the Investment 
Manager on insurance expenses for the projected peri od, which are based on the existing insurance costs of the 
SPVs.  
4. Other Expenses:  Other Expenses represented by the Investment Manager includes Statutory fees, Rajasthan 
Renewable Energy Development Fund Charges (RREDC), Spares, Inverter Charges/ Replacements costs, 
Overheads which include expenses related to IT, HR, Admin, Compliance, Audit fees, etc. I have relied on the 
estimate of these expenses as provided by the Investment Manager. 
O&M expenses are projected to escalate ~2-4% year on year basis. PM fees is observed to be escalating at 7% p.a 
in line with operating expenses (excluding Insurance and any expense which is statutory in nature). Other costs are 
escalated at ~2.5% p.a. 
(Refer Appendix 6 and 10 for detailed working) 
 
7.2.5. Capital Expenditure (“Capex”):  
I understand that Solar SPVs has sourced majority of its components such as solar panels and inverters directly from 
multiple manufacturers with industry standard warra nty and guarantee terms.  I understand that some of the SPVs 
are expected to incur Capex in the projected period.  
 
 
7.2.6 Tax and Tax Incentive:  
As per the discussions with the Investment Manager, the new provisions of Income Tax Act has been considered for 
the projected period of the Solar SPVs except for UMD, TL Kanji and TL Nangla wherein new provisions of Income 
tax act have been considered after lapse of 80IA and utilization of MAT credit benefits. 
 
7.2.7 Working Capital:  
The Investment Manager has represented the working capital requirement of the SPV for the projected period in 
terms of trade payables days and trade receivables (Debtors & Unbilled revenue) days. 
The trade payables days are considered to be 45  days (of annual expenses) based on historical trend, and trade 
receivables days are considered to be 45 days (of annual revenue), based on the historical collection trends, terms 
of the respective PPAs and applicable Electricity Rules (like Electricity Rules, 2022).  
 
7.2.8 RREDC Charges:  
REDC are state-imposed levies applicable to renewable energy projects, primarily solar and wind, in select Indian 
states. These charges are collected by the respective State Nodal Agencies or State Load Despatch Centres 
(SLDCs) to fund regulatory activities, facilitate infrastructure development, and promote the growth of renewable 
energy within the state.

7.2.9 Terminal Value:  
Terminal value represents the present value at the end of explicit forecast period of all subsequent cash flows till 
the end of the life of the asset or into perpetuity if the asset has an indefinite life. As the ownership of the 
underlying assets (tangible assets) shall remain with the SPV even after the expiry of PPA term and as the cash 
flows beyond the end of tenure i.e. 30 years are relatively uncertain, the terminal period value (i.e. value on 
account of cash flows to be generated after the expiry of the period) has been considered based on the salvage 
value of the plant & machinery, sale of freehold land and realization of working capital at the end of the tenure. 
 
 
(B)          The key assumptions for Cash Flows pertaining to Certified Emission Reduction (“CER”) are as follows: 
The SPVs are also engaged in selling CER units to carbon credit traders/ end users. I understand from the Investment 
Manager that the SPVs have received the necessary registrations / certifications.  Hence revenue generated from 
this activity has been estimated by the Investment Manager during the projected period for all the SPVs. The Cash 
Flows under this category are driven by market forces of demand and supply. 
 
7.2.10 Sale of units for Certified Emission Reductions (CERs):  
 
The Investment Manager has estimated the revenue from sale of CER units based on projected units generated by 
the SPVs from their respective Solar Plant(s), whereas the estimated selling price of CER is based on a market 
information. The Investment Manager expects to sell the CER units from FY27. 
 
7.2.11 Expenses / Capital Expenditure: 
 I have been informed by the Investment Manager that no material separate expenses or capital expenditure is 
expected to be incurred by the SPVs for selling the CER units earning. The general admin expenses are already 
considered while projecting the expenses in Para 7.2.4 above. 
7.2.12 Taxes and Tax Incentive:  
As per discussions with the Investment Manager, income generated from the sale of carbon credits is subject to 
effective tax under the Income Tax Act. 
7.2.13 Working Capital: 
The Investment Manager has represented the working capital requirement of the SPVs will be negligible. Based 
on the past trend, the Investment Manager has represented that income generated from the sale of CER units is 
typically received concurrent with the sales themselves. Therefore, for the forecasted period concerning CER 
Income, the Investment Manager has projected a trade receivable period of 0 days.

7.2 The key assumptions for Battery Energy Storage System revenue, incentives and penalty of the SPVs, are 
as follows: 
 
7.3.1 Revenue:  
Battery Energy Storage System Projects  SPV, earn revenue from the sale of BESS Capacity  pursuant to BESPA 
as approved by the appropriate commission, which will be fixed for entire term of agreement at delivery point. As a 
capacity-based contract, the SPV receives availability-based tariff under the BESPA irrespective of the actual 
utilization of BESS by the buying utility . The tariff for the SPV is contracted for the period of the relevant BESPA, 
which is up to 12 years from the scheduled commissioning date. 
Where long -term BESPAs are in place, BESS SPVs receive fixed availability -based payments, independent of 
actual dispatch, provided the system remains operational and available as per the agreed technical performance 
standards. 
 
7.3.2 Penalty: 
If monthly system availability falls below 95%, the monthly capacity charges are proportionally reduced as per the 
BESPA. Based on my analysis, in the present case, it is assumed that the monthly availability will not fall below 
95% and hence, penalty is not considered in the financial projections. 
 
7.3.3 Expenses: 
Expenses are estimated by the Investment Manager for the projected period based on the inflation rate as 
determined for the SPVs. I have relied on the projections provided by the Investment Manager. 
 
• Operations & Maintenance (“O&M”):  O&M expenditure is estimated by the Investment Manager for the 
projected period based on the inflation rate as determined for the SPVs. The Investment Manager has projected 
expenses to be incurred for the O&M of the SPVs including, but not limited to, BESS maintenance expenses, 
rates and taxes, legal and professional fees and other general and administration expenses. I have relied on 
the projections provided by Investment Manager on the O&M expenses for the projected period. 
 
• Insurance Expenses: I understand from the Investment Manager that the insurance expenses of the SPVs 
are not reasonably expected to inflate for the projected period. I have relied on the projections provided by the 
Investment Manager on the insurance expenses for the projected period. 
(Refer Appendix 6 and 9 for detailed workings) 
 
7.3.4 Depreciation: 
For calculating depreciation as per Income Tax Act for the projected period, I have considered depreciation rate as 
specified in the Income Tax Act and WDV as provided by the Investment Manager. 
 
7.3.5 Capex: 
For calculating depreciation as per Income Tax Act for the projected period, I have considered depreciation rate as 
specified in the Income Tax Act and WDV as provided by the Investment Manager. 
 
7.3.6 Tax and Tax Incentive: 
As per the discussions with the Investment Manager, Section 115BAA of Income Tax Act,196 has been considered 
for the projected period of the SPVfor the current valuation exercise, which inter alia does not provide benefits of 
additional depreciation and section 80 -IA and Sec 115 JB. Accordingly, the base corporate tax rate of 22% (with 
applicable surcharge and cess) is considered. 
 
7.3.7 Working Capital: 
The Investment Manager has represented the working capital requirement of the SPVs for the projected period. The 
operating working capital assumptions for the projections provided by the Investment Manager comprises of prepaid 
expense, security deposit, trade receivables, unbilled revenue, trade payables and others.

7.4. Calculation of Weighted Average Cost of Capital for the SPVs: 
7.4.1. Cost of Equity:  
Cost of Equity (CoE) is a discounting factor to calculate the returns expected by the equity holders depending on the 
perceived level of risk associated with the business and the industry in which the business operates. 
For this purpose, I have used the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which is a commonly used model to determine 
the appropriate cost of equity for the SPVs. 
K(e) = Rf + (ERP* Beta) + CSRP 
Wherein: 
K(e) = cost of equity 
Rf    = risk free rate 
ERP = Equity Risk Premium  
Beta  = a measure of the sensitivity of assets to returns of the overall market 
CSRP = Company Specific Risk Premium (In general, an additional company-specific risk premium will be added to 
the cost of equity calculated pursuant to CAPM). 
For valuation exercise, I have arrived at adjusted cost of equity of the SPVs based on the above calculation  
(Refer Appendix 3 for detailed working). 
 
7.4.2. Risk Free Rate: 
I have applied a risk free rate of return of 6.72% on the basis of the zero coupon yield curve as on 30th September 2025 
for government securities having a maturity period of 10 years, as quoted on the website of Clearing Corporation of 
India Limited. For comparison, the previous valuation as of June 2025 used a risk-free rate of 6.46%. 
 
7.4.3. Equity Risk Premium (“ERP”): 
The Equity Risk Premium (ERP) is a measure of the additional return that investors require for investing in equity 
markets over risk -free assets, such as government bonds. It is typically estimated by comparing historical realised 
returns on equity with the risk-free rate, often represented by 10-year government securities. For my estimation of the 
ERP for India, I have analysed rolling historical returns of the Nifty 50 Index over 10-year, 15-year, and 20-year periods, 
covering data from 2000 to 2025. As o f 30th September, the calculated ERP based on these rolling return periods 
stands at 6.42%, 6.71% and 7.53% for the 10 -year, 15-year and 20-year periods respectively. These figures indicate 
variability in ERP over different investment horizons, but collect ively they suggest a range around 6% to 8%. 
Considering the historical trends, variability across periods, and long -term expectations, an equity risk premium of 7% 
for India continues to be an appropriate and reasonable assumption. For comparison, the previous valuation as of June 
2025 used an Equity Risk Premium of 7.00%. 
 
7.4.4. Beta: 
Beta is a measure of the sensitivity of a company’s stock price to the movements of the overall market index. In the 
present case, I find it appropriate to consider the beta of companies in similar business/ industry to that of the SPVs for 
an appropriate period. 
 
Transmission Assets: 
 
Based on my analysis of the listed InvITs and other companies in power and infrastructure sectors, I find it appropriate 
to consider the beta of Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (“PGCIL” ), Powergrid Infrastructure Investment Trust 
and IndiGrid Infrastructure Trust for the current valuation exercise. 
 
Solar Assets: 
 
(A) Beta for cash flows dependent on the terms of PPA:  
For the valuation of the SPVs, I find it appropriate to consider the beta of NTPC Limited, Powergrid Infrastructure 
Investment Trust, Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. and IndiGrid Infrastructure Trust for an appropriate period. The 
beta so arrived, is further adjusted based on the factors of mentioned SPVs like completion of projects, revenue 
certainty, past collection trend, lack of execution uncertainty, etc. to arrive at the adjusted unlevered beta appropriate 
to the SPVs.  
  
 
(B) Beta for cash flows pertaining to Certified Emission Reduction (“CER”): 
 For the purpose of determination of Ke for discounting CER Cash Flows, I find it appropriate to consider the beta of 
one (1) considering the risk in the absence of any comparable companies for this business activitiy. I have considered 
debt-equity at 0:100 for the cash flows pertaining to CER. Accordingly, the re -levered beta of 1 has been considered 
for all the SPVs for the cash flows pertaining to CER.

Battery Energy Storage System Assets: 
 
Based on my analysis of the listed InvITs and other companies in power and infrastructure sectors, I find it appropriate 
to consider the beta of Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (“PGCIL”) ,  Powergrid Infrastructure Investment Trust 
and IndiGrid Infrastructure Trust for the current valuation exercise. 
 
(Refer Appendix 2 for justification for including the above comparables in beta computation) 
 
I have further unlevered the beta of such companies based on market debt-equity of the respective company using the 
following formula:  
Unlevered Beta = Levered Beta / [1 + (Debt / Equity) *(1-T)]  
Further I have re-levered it based on debt-equity at 70:30 based on the industry Debt: Equity ratio using the following 
formula:  
Re-levered Beta = Unlevered Beta * [1 + (Debt / Equity) *(1-T)]  
Accordingly, as per above, I have arrived at re-levered betas of the SPVs.  
(Refer Appendix 2 for relevered beta) 
7.4.5. Company Specific Risk Premium (“CSRP”): 
Discount Rate is the return expected by a market participant from a particular investment and shall reflect not only the 
time value of money but also the risk inherent in the asset being valued as well as the risk inherent in achieving the 
future cash flows. 
While determining the WACC or K(e) of ENICL for the terminal period, I have considered CSRP of 3% on account of 
uncertainty attached to the determination of cash flows of ENICL for the terminal period. 
The tariff of PrKTCL, KTL-II, KTL-III, PTCL-II and KNTL-II is determined under Section 62 of the Act by CERC which is 
subject to changes on a regular interval. Certain components that subject to changes are the expected rate of return 
on equity, operation and maintenance expenses, interest expenses, etc. that may have a bearing on the estimated tariff 
and consequently on the cash flows of the SPVS during the projected period. Hence, for PrKTCL, KTL, PTCL and KNTL 
considering the nature of regulatory risk and its likely impact on the cash flows of the SPVs during the projected period 
due to review of tariff determination (such tariff determination review is carried out every five years) norms during the 
useful life of the SPV and later, approval of the true up petition by CERC and basis my discussion with Investment 
Manager, I found it appropriate to consider 1% CSRP. 
In other case, considering the length of the explicit period, the basis of deriving the underlying cash flows and basis my 
discussion with Investment Manager, I found it appropriate to consider 0% CSRP. 
For comparison, the CSRP was same for previous valuations as of June 2025. 
 
7.4.6. Cost of Debt: 
The calculation of Cost of Debt post-tax can be defined as follows: 
K(d) = K(d) pre-tax * (1 - T) 
Wherein: 
K(d) = Cost of debt 
T = tax rate as applicable 
For the current valuation exercise, pre-tax cost of debt has been considered as 7.44%, as represented by the Investment 
Manager. For comparison, the previous valuation as of June 2025 used a Cost of Debt of 7.53% 
7.4.7. Debt : Equity Ratio: 
In the present valuation exercise, I have considered debt : equity ratio of 70:30 based on industry standards and as per 
the guidance provided by various statutes governing the industry. I have considered the industry benchmark since the 
cost of capital is a forward-looking measure and captures the cost of raising new funds to buy the asset at any valuation 
date (not the current actually deployed). Specifically, such benchmark is required to consider the nature of the asset 
class, and the comparative facts from the industry to arrive at the correct assumption. 
Moreover, Regulation 20 of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations, 
2014 permits an InvIT to raise debt upto 70 percent of the value of assets subject to the fulfillment of specific 
conditions including: 
(i) obtaining a credit rating of “AAA” or equivalent for its consolidated borrowing and the proposed  borrowing, from 
a credit rating agency registered with the Board; 
(ii) have a track record of at least six distributions, in terms of sub-regulation (6) of regulation 18, on a continuous 
basis, post listing, as at the end of the quarter preceding the date on which the enhanced borrowings are proposed 
to be made. 
(iii) utilize the funds only for acquisition or development of infrastructure projects. 
(iv) obtain the approval of unitholders in the manner specified in sub-regulation (5A) of regulation 22.] 
Given the risk profile of Solar, Transmission & Battery Energy Storage System projects and considering the leverage 
at 70% of the total project cost based on rating agencies reports available in public domain, and further considering

the InvIT Regulations allowing in general upto 70% leverage in assets where the AAA rating has been obtained, a 
debt-to-equity ratio of 70% for Solar asset was found to be appropriate. 
Accordingly, I have considered the same weightage to arrive at the WACC of the SPVs.  For comparison, the previous 
valuation of June 2025 used a Debt Equity Ratio of 70:30. 
 
7.4.8. Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): 
The discount rate, or the WACC, is the weighted average of the expected return on equity and the cost of debt. The 
weight of each factor is determined based on the company’s optimal capital structure. 
Formula for calculation of WACC: 
WACC = [K(d) * Debt /(Debt + Equity)] + [K(e) * (1 - Debt /(Debt + Equity))] 
Accordingly, as per above, I have arrived the WACC for the explicit period of the SPVs.

7.4.9.    Cash Accrual Factor (CAF) and Discounting Factor  
Discounted cash flow require to forecast cash flows in future and discount them to the present in order to arrive at 
present value of the asset as on Valuation Date.  
To discount back the projections we use the Cash Accrual  Factor (“CAF”). The Cash Accrual Factor refers to the 
duration between the Valuation date and the point at which each cash flow is expected to accrue.Discounted cash flow 
is equal to sum of the cash flow in each period divided by discounting factor, where the discounting factor is determined 
by raising one plus discount rate (WACC) to the power of the CAF. 
DCF = [CF1 / (1+r)CAF1] + [CF2 / (1+r)CAF2] + ... + [CFn /(1+r)CAFn]  
Where,  
CF = Cash Flows,  
CAF = Cash accrual factor for particular period , R = Discount Rate (i.e. WACC)

8 Valuation Conclusion 
8.1 The current valuation has been carried out based on the discussed valuation methodology explained herein earlier. 
Further, various qualitative factors, the business dynamics and growth potential of the business, having regard to 
information base, management perceptions, key underlying assumptions and limitations were given due 
consideration. 
8.2 I have been represented by the Investment Manager that there is no potential devolvement on account of the 
contingent liability as of valuation date; hence no impact has been factored in to arrive at fair EV of the SPVs. 
8.3 Based on the above analysis, the fair EV as on the Valuation Date of the SPVs is as mentioned below:

8.4 EV is described as the total value of the equity in a business plus the value of its debt and debt related liabilities, 
minus any cash or cash equivalents to meet those liabilities.  
8.5 The EV as described above is not inclusive of cash and cash equivalents of the SPVs as on the Valuation Date. 
8.6 The fair EV of the SPVs is estimated using DCF method. The valuation requires the Investment Manager to make 
certain assumptions about the model inputs including forecast cash flows, discount rate, and credit risk. 
8.7 Valuation is based on estimates of future financial performance or opinions, which represent reasonable expectations 
at a particular point of time, but such information, estimates or opinions are not offered as predictions or as 
assurances that a particular level of income or profit will be achieved, a particular event will occur or that a particular 
price will be offered or accepted. Actual results achieved during the period covered by the prospective financial 
analysis will vary from these estimates and the variations may be material.

11. Exclusions and Limitations 
11.1 My Report is subject to the limitations detailed hereinafter. This Report is to be read in totality, and not in parts, in 
conjunction with the relevant documents referred to herein. 
11.2 Valuation analysis and results are specific to the purpose of valuation and is not intended to represent value at any time 
other than the valuation date of 30th September 2025 (“Valuation Date”) mentioned in the Report and as per agreed 
terms of my engagement. It may not be valid for any other purpose or as at any other date. Also, it may not be valid if 
done on behalf of any other entity. 
11.3 This Report, its contents and the results are specific to (i) the purpose of valuation agreed as per the terms of my 
engagements; (ii) the Valuation Date; and (iii) are based on the financial information of the SPVs till 30th September 
2025. The Investment Manager has represented that the business activities of the SPVs have been carried out in normal 
and ordinary course between 30th September 2025 and the Report Date and that no material changes have occurred 
in the operations and financial position between 30th September 2025 and the Report date. 
11.4 The scope of my assignment did not involve me performing audit tests for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
fairness or accuracy of any financial or analytical information that was provided and used by me during the course of 
my work. The assignment did not involve me to conduct the financial or technical feasibility study. I have not done any 
independent technical valuation or appraisal or due diligence of the assets or liabilities of the SPVs or any of other entity 
mentioned in this Report and have considered them at the value as disclosed by the SPVs in their regulatory filings or 
in submissions, oral or written, made to me. 
11.5 In addition, I do not take any responsibility for any changes in the information used by me to arrive at my conclusion as 
set out herein which may occur subsequent to the date of my Report or by virtue of fact that the details provided to me 
are incorrect or inaccurate. 
11.6 I have assumed and relied upon the truth, accuracy and completeness of the information, data and financial terms 
provided to me or used by me; I have assumed that the same are not misleading and do not assume or accept any 
liability or responsibility for any independent verification of such information or any independent technical valuation or 
appraisal of any of the assets, operations or liabilities of the SPVs or any other entity mentioned in the Report. Nothing 
has come to my knowledge to indicate that the material provided to me was misstated or incorrect or would not afford 
reasonable grounds upon which to base my Report. 
11.7 This Report is intended for the sole use in connection with the purpose as set out above. It can however be relied upon 
and disclosed in connection with any statutory and regulatory filing in connection with the provision of SEBI InvIT 
Regulations. However, I will not accept any responsibility to any other party to whom this Report may be shown or who 
may acquire a copy of the Report, without my written consent. 
11.8 It is clarified that this Report is not a fairness opinion under any of the stock exchange/ listing regulations. In case of 
any third party having access to this Report, please note this Report is not a substitute for the third party’s own due 
diligence/ appraisal/ enquiries/ independent advice that the third party should undertake for his purpose. 
11.9 Further, this Report is necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, 
and the information made available to me or used by me up to, the date hereof. Subsequent developments in the 
aforementioned conditions may affect this Report and the assumptions made in preparing this Report and I shall not be 
obliged to update, revise or reaffirm this Report if information provided to me changes. 
11.10 This Report is based on the information received from the sources as mentioned in Section 9 of this Report and 
discussions with the Investment Manager. I have assumed that no information has been withheld that could have 
influenced the purpose of my Report. 
11.11 Valuation is not a precise science and the conclusions arrived at in many cases may be subjective and dependent on 
the exercise of individual judgment. There is, therefore, no indisputable single value. I have arrived at an indicative EV 
based on my analysis. While I have provided an assessment of the value based on an analysis of information available 
to me and within the scope of my engagement, others may place a different value on this business. 
11.12 Any discrepancies in any table / appendix between the total and the sums of the amounts listed are due to rounding-
off. 
11.13 Valuation is based on estimates of future financial performance or opinions, which represent reasonable expectations 
at a particular point of time, but such information, estimates or opinions are not offered as predictions or as assurances 
that a particular level of income or profit will be achieved, a particular event will occur or that a particular price will be 
offered or accepted. Actual results achieved during the period covered by the prospective financial analysis will vary 
from these estimates and the variations may be material. 
11.14 I do not carry out any validation procedures or due diligence with respect to the information provided/extracted or carry 
out any verification of the assets or comment on the achievability and reasonableness of the assumptions underlying 
the financial forecasts, save for satisfying ourselves to the extent possible that they are consistent with other information 
provided to me in the course of this engagement. 
11.15 My conclusion assumes that the assets and liabilities of the SPVs, reflected in their respective latest balance sheets 
remain intact as of the Report date, except for changes occurring due to ordinary course of business. 
11.16 Whilst all reasonable care has been taken to ensure that the factual statements in the Report are accurate, neither 
myself, nor any of my associates, officers or employees shall in any way be liable or responsible either directly or 
indirectly for the contents stated herein. Accordingly, I make no representation or warranty, express or implied, in 
respect of the completeness, authenticity or accuracy of such factual statements. I expressly disclaim any and all

liabilities, which may arise based upon the information used in this Report. I am not liable to any third party in relation 
to the issue of this Report. 
11.17 The scope of my work has been limited both in terms of the areas of the business & operations which I have reviewed 
and the extent to which I have reviewed them. There may be matters, other than those noted in this Report, which might 
be relevant in the context of the transaction and which a wider scope might uncover. 
11.18 For the present valuation exercise, I have also relied on information available in public domain; however the accuracy 
and timelines of the same has not been independently verified by me. 
11.19 In the particular circumstances of this case, my liability (in contract or under any statute or otherwise) for any economic 
loss or damage arising out of or in connection with this engagement, however the loss or damage caused, shall be 
limited to the amount of fees actually received by me from the Investment Manager, as laid out in the engagement letter 
for such valuation work. However, such cap shall not be applicable to damages arising from fraud or willful default or 
gross negligence as established in civil or criminal proceedings. 
11.20 In rendering this Report, I have not provided any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or actuarial advice and accordingly I 
do not assume any responsibility or liability in respect thereof. 
11.21 This Report does not address the relative merits of investing in InvIT as compared with any other alternative business 
transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. 
11.22 I am not an advisor with respect to legal, tax and regulatory matters for the proposed transaction. No investigation of 
the SPVs’ claim to title of assets has been made for the purpose of this Report and the SPVs’ claim to such rights have 
been assumed to be valid. No consideration has been given to liens or encumbrances against the assets, beyond the 
loans disclosed in the accounts. Therefore, no responsibility is assumed for matters of a legal nature. 
11.23 I have no present or planned future interest in the Trustee, Investment Manager or the SPVs and the fee for this Report 
is not contingent upon the values reported herein. My valuation analysis should not be construed as investment advice; 
specifically, I do not express any opinion on the suitability or otherwise of entering into any financial or other transaction 
with the Investment Manager or SPVs. 
11.24 I have submitted the draft valuation report to the Trust & Investment Manager for confirmation of accuracy of factual 
data used in my analysis and to prevent any error or inaccuracy in this Report. 
11.25 Other Limitations: 
• This Report is based on the information provided by the representatives of the Investment Manager. The exercise 
has been restricted and kept limited to and based entirely on the documents, records, files, registers and 
information provided to me. I have not verified the information independently with any other external source. 
• I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as original, 
and the conformity of the copies or extracts submitted to me with that of the original documents. 
• I have assumed that the documents submitted to me by the representatives of Investment Manager in connection 
with any particular issue are the only documents related to such issue. 
• I have reviewed the documents and records from the limited perspective of examining issues noted in the scope of 
work and I do not express any opinion as to the legal or technical implications of the same. 
11.26 Limitation of Liabilities 
i. It is agreed that, having regard to the RV’s interest in limiting the personal liability and exposure to litigation of its 
personnel, the Sponsor, the Investment Manager and the Trust will not bring any claim in respect of any damage 
against the RV personally. 
ii. In no circumstances RV shall be responsible for any consequential, special, direct, indirect, punitive or incidental loss, 
damages or expenses (including loss of profits, data, business, opportunity cost, goodwill or indemnification) in 
connection with the performance of the services whether such damages are based on breach of contract, tort, strict  
liability, breach of warranty,  or otherwise, even if the Investment Manager had contemplated and communicated to 
RV the likelihood of such damages. Any decision to act upon the deliverables (including this Report) is to be made by 
the Investment Manager and no communication by RV should be treated as an invitation or inducement to engage 
the Investment Manager to act upon the deliverable(s). 
iii. It is clarified that the Investment Manager will be solely responsible for any delays, additional costs, or other liabilities 
caused by or associated with any deficiencies in their responsibilities, misrepresentations, incorrect and incomplete 
information including information provided to determine the assumptions. 
iv. RV will not be liable if any loss arises due to the provision of false, misleading or incomplete information or 
documentation by the Investment Manager.

Justification of Companies used for calculation of Beta for Transmission SPV’s: 
The following companies are integral players in the Indian infrastructure sector and contributes significantly to the develop ment, operation and maintenance of 
infrastructure project. Their strong market presence, diversified portfolios and consistent involvement in the key infrastructure projects make them relevant for the 
computation of beta of Transmission SPV’s in the context of transmission business valuation: 
1. PG InvIT  
PowerGrid InvIT (PG InvIT) primarily owns and operates high -voltage power transmission lines, which form a critical component of India’s electricity infrastructure. The 
trust earns regulated revenues through long-term, fixed-fee contracts with utilities, offering predictable and stable cash flows over extended periods. Accordingly, PG InviT 
has been included as a comparable for beta calculation in the valuation of transmission company. 
2. PGCIL 
Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL) is mainly engaged in transmitting total electricity generated in the country. PGCIL has been considered as a comparable 
for beta calculation in the valuation of the Transmission company due to its operational alignment with the transmission business. The company operates capital-Intensive, 
regulated transmission asset with stable and predictable cashflows —Characteristics that closely align with those of Transmission businesses. Accordingly, PGCIL has 
been included as a comparable for beta calculation in the valuation of transmission company.  
3. IndiGrid Infrastructure Trust 
Indigrid Infrastructure Trust owns and operates a diversified portfolio of infrastructure assets, with a significant share in  power transmission. The trust earns stable, 
regulated revenues through long -term availability-based contracts, providing predictab le cash flows similar to other transmission -focused entities. While Indigrid was 
previously excluded from the beta analysis due to low trading frequency, its trading activity has improved significantly and remains stable in the current year. Hence the 
Beta of IndiGrid is also included for determination of Beta.

Justification of Companies used for calculation of Beta for Solar SPVs: 
The following companies are integral players in the Indian infrastructure sector and contributes significantly to the develop ment, operation and maintenance of 
infrastructure project. Their strong market presence, diversified portfolios and consistent involvement in the key infrastructure projects make them relevant for the 
computation of beta of Solar SPVs in the context of Solar business valuation: 
1. PG InvIT  
PowerGrid InvIT (PG InvIT) primarily owns and operates high -voltage power transmission lines, which form a critical component of India’s electricity infrastructure. The 
trust earns regulated revenues through long -term, fixed-fee contracts with utilities, o ffering predictable and stable cash flows over extended periods.  PGInviT has been 
included as a comparable for beta calculation in the valuation of Solar generation company primarily due to its Structure as an Infrastructure Investment Trust (InviT). Due 
to lack of directly listed solar generation InviT, PGInviT – being part of broader InviT category —serves as a relevant proxy given the structural and financial similarities 
shared across InviTs. PGInviT Operated Capital -intensive, regulated infrastructure assets that generates predictable cash flows. This stability in ea rnings and business 
model alignment reinforces the rationale for selecting PGInvIT as a comparable entity,particularly when exact matches withing the solar segment are not available.  
2. PGCIL 
Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL) is mainly engaged in transmitting total electricity generated in the country. PGCIL has been considered as a comparable 
for beta calculation in the valuation of the solar generation company due to its structural and operational alignment with the InviT model. In the absence of a directly listed 
solar InviT PGCIL serves as a suitable proxy within the broader infrastructure category. The company operates capital-Intensive, regulated transmission asset with stable 
and predictable cashflows—Characteristics that closely align with those of solar generation businesses. Furthermore, the operational stability and low market volatility 
associated with PGCIL resonate well with the risk profile of the company being valued, justifying its inclusion as a relevant comparable for beta estimation. 
3. NTPC Ltd. 
NTPC Ltd is mainly enegaged in power generation and has very limited percentage of its portfolio under construction majority of revenue is through selling of electric units 
to various distribution companies in India through PPAs. NTPC shares several key ch aracteristics with standalone solar companies including capital intensity, Long – 
term power purchase agreements (PPAs), regulated returns and government linked policy frameworks. Except for the generation r isk on account of its Efficacy, the 
cashflows of NTPC are predictable based on the long-term PPAs and infrastructure setup of the business which makes it comparable to the solar business of the trust. 
4. IndiGrid Infrastructure Trust 
Indigrid Infrastructure Trust owns and operates a diversified portfolio of infrastructure assets including transmission and S olar assets. It also acquired operational solar 
power assets, expanding its presence in the renewable energy sector. These assets operate under long -term power purchase agreements (PPAs), offering visibility of 
                                                                                                                                                               S. SUNDARARAMAN

Matters - 
Customs Act

Indirect Tax 
Department
Commissioner 
of Customs
Background of the case: BDTCL cleared 6 bill of entries and claimed the benefit of concessional rate of 
5% under the Project Import Regulations 1986 before registering the contract with the Customs House, 
thus violating the provisions of Regulation 4 of the Project Import Regulations. BDTCL had received a 
Show Cause dated 22 October 2019 requiring it to show cause as to why differential duty and interest 
should not be demanded on the goods imported and cleared for home consumption at concessional duty 
rate of 5% under the Project Import Regulations 1986 insofar as such goods have been cleared before 
registering the contracts with the Custom Houses.
In this regard, a personal hearing notice was received by BDTCL directing it to appear before the 
Commissioner on 21 December 2018. BDTCL has sought an extension to file the reply to the Show Cause 
Notice. While BDTCL was following up with the customs Department for collation of documents required for 
filing reply to the SCN, an adjudication order dated 18 July 2019 was issued without giving BDTCL

23 Regulatory CERC APTEL Background of the case: In its order dated 20.09.2017, CERC approved the Commercial Operation Date 
(COD) of certain transmission assets developed by PGCIL under Regulation 4(3)(ii) of the CERC Tariff 
Regulations, 2014. Although these assets were ready, they could not be put to use because BDTCL’s 
connected transmission lines were not yet commissioned. CERC held that the delay was on BDTCL’s part 
and directed BDTCL to pay transmission charges for the PGCIL assets from their approved COD until 
BDTCL’s own downstream assets became operational. Aggrieved by this order, BDTCL filed Review Petition 
No. 46/RP/2017, which was dismissed by CERC, reaffirming its original direction. BDTCL subsequently filed 
an appeal before APTEL.
The associated BDTCL transmission elements include the 765 kV JB Line, 765 kV BI Line, and 765 kV BD 
Line.
Current Status: Previous hearings held on multiple dates from 2.12.2019 to 29.8.2023. IA No. 1158 of

for the period from 09.02.2015 to 13.06.2015 (124 days), would be borne by PGCIL. PGCIL challenged 
this decision by filing Review Petition No. 29/RP/2018, which was dismissed by CERC through an Order 
dated 15.04.2019. Aggrieved, PGCIL has filed an appeal before APTEL.

Background of the case: Four entry tax demands amounting to a total of INR 138.75 Mn were raised on JTCL for 
goods imported into Madhya Pradesh during the construction phase. The payments pertain to FY 2013, 2014, 2015 
and 2016. It was contended by the SPV that the entry tax should not be levied because the goods were purchased 
prior to the commencement of the business and not in the course of business. 
Current Status: The matters are currently pending adjudication. Writ petitions have been filed before the Hon'ble MP 
High Court and the matters have tagged NTPC's case (VATA 09/2010) wherein it was held that no entry tax is payable 
on the purchases made during the construction phase.

Background of the case: 
Indirect tax matters involving JTCL are in relation to demand for payment of entry tax for FY 2014-15, which was 
allegedly incurred by JTCL during the course of its business. The aggregate amount involved in the matters is INR 
40.50 Million. JTCL had filed an appeal against the Order before the Commissioner (Appeals) on 22 October 2018. The 
Appeal was admitted by the Hon'ble Commissioner (Appeals) and it was requested that the matter be kept in 
abeyance till the time finality is obtained in the matters for previous Assessment Years. However, the Additional 
Commissioner did not accept further request for adjournment and passed his order dated 21 November 2019 
(received by JTCL on 05 December 2019) upholding the duty demand on the basis of the Tribunal order for the past 
period. Simultaneously, a garnishee notice had also been issued by the Jurisdictional Deputy Commissioner at 
Bilaspur to PGCIL directing them to make payment of the balance tax amount of INR 34.42 Million outstanding as at 
that date. JTCL has immediately filed a letter dated 06 January 2019 to the Deputy Commissioner with a copy to the 
Commissioner stating that any such recovery before expiry of 30 days from the date of communication of order is 
completely out of place and illegal. 
JTCL has thereafter filed an Appeal before the Tribunal to challenge the order of the Additional Commissioner and also 
made pre-deposit in this regard. Pursuant to appeal filing, the PGCIL recovery notice has been withdrawn. The matter 
will be heard in the Tribunal in due course.
Current Status: The matter is currently pending adjudication.

CERC Background of the Case:
PGCIL filed Petition No. 261/TT/2015 before CERC for determination of transmission tariff for line bays and reactors 
related to JTCL’s JB and JD transmission lines under the Tariff Regulations, 2014. CERC, via Order dated 27.05.2016, 
held that transmission charges during the mismatch period (i.e., COD of Asset-I: 05.10.2014 to 01.07.2015 and Asset-
II: 13.11.2014 to 01.07.2015) would be billed to the LTTCs of JTCL. Accordingly, PGCIL initiated bilateral billing and 
issued a Notice of Regulation of Power to MBPMPL due to non-payment of ₹2.87 crore.
Current Status:
MBPMPL challenged the billing by filing Petition No. 232/MP/2018 and later filed Review Petition No. 35/RP/2018 
against the 2016 Order. CERC, on 28.01.2020, disposed of the review and reopened Petition 261/TT/2015 only to 
reconsider the levy of bilateral billing. The matter has since been disposed.

Background of the case: Period from - FY 14-15 & FY15-16
The Commercial Tax Department, Government of Madhya Pradesh sent a notice of demand 
of  Entry Tax on RTCL for payment of entry tax of INR 9.43 Million and penalty of INR 3.72 
Million. 
As per the Entry Tax Act,1976 dealer is liable to pay Entry tax during the course of 
business. However, RTCL is in the opinion that since the business is in construction phase, 
entry tax is not payable. Further, RTCL filed a writ petition (3759/2017) in the Madhya 
Pradesh High Court in which conditional stay was granted by the court on 7 March 2017. As 
per the order, RTCL needs to deposit 50% of the amount. 
Current Status: Entry tax demand of INR 13.30 Million for RAPP Transmission Company 
Limited ('RTCL') pertains to demands under the Entry tax act read with Madhya Pradesh Vat 
Act, 2002 for payment of entry tax upon completion of assessment by tax authorities for 
the year 2014-15 & 2015-16. RTCL has appealed against the demand before High Court, 
Jabalpur (Madhya Pradesh). The management, including its tax advisors, believe that it's 
position will likely be upheld in the appellate process. No expense has been accrued in the 
consolidated financial statements for the tax demands raised. The management believes 
that the ultimate outcome of this proceeding will not have a material adverse effect on the 
financial position and results of the operations of RTCL. RTCL has deposited INR 4.72 Million 
with the tax authorities against the said demands to comply the order of Hon'ble High court 
of the Madhya Pradesh. The Hon'ble High Court has accepted the plea of RTCL and has 
given stay on entire demand after deposit of specified amount till the disposal of case. The 
writ petition has been tagged along with a similar matter of M/s NTPC (LTD.) in VATA 
09/2010 and is pending for hearing before the Hon'ble High Court.

Appeal filed by TNEPDCL challenging APTEL’s Judgment dated 15.09.2022 allowing 
payment of carrying cost and O&M expenses  towards Change in Law relief in Solar 
PPAs which do not have a restitution clause. 
While ISPL I & II are not parties to these proceedings, CERC while granting GST 
Change in Law relief has held that relief towards Carrying Cost and O&M expenses 
will be as per Supreme Court’s decision in this Civil Appeal. Accordingly, decision in 
this case will affect ISPL I&II’s change in law compensation.

AO Background of the case: 
Recharacterization of CCDs as equity and consequent disallowance of interest on

jurisdictional Assessing Officer (AO) seeking exclusion of interest on such 
CCDs—disallowed by the learned AO—from the computation of disallowance under

resultant demand is expected to become nil.

Federation of 
India (NSEF 
on behalf of 
TNSPEPL, 
UMD, 
Terralight 
Kanji and 
Terralight 
Rajapalayam)
Principal Bench of 
Madras High Court
Background of the Case:
TNERC’s Order dated 25 March 2019
Certain back down instructions were issued by the SLDC to UMD, TKSPL, TN Solar and TRSPL (VRET Assets) and no compensation for deemed 
generation compensation was paid by the SLDC or TANGEDCO (Tamil Nadu Electricity Board) for the period corresponding to the backed down 
generation. Such backdown instructions by SLDC were challenged by the NSEFI on behalf of solar power generators, including VRET Assets before 
the TNERC. The TNERC, vide its order dated 25 March 2019, held that while the SLDC should not resort to back down instructions without recording 
specific reasons. However, since the underlying PPAs did not contain any provision in relation to payment of any compensation for deemed 
generation, no deemed generation can be granted.
NSEFI’s Appeal before the APTEL [Appeal 197/2019]
Challenging the TNERC’s order, NSEFI filed an appeal before the APTEL, seeking: (i) a direction to the respondents (TANGEDCO, SLDC, 
TANTRANSCO and MNRE) to stop issuing backing down instructions to solar power plants and implement ‘must run’ status on all solar power plants 
under regulation 5.2 of the Grid Code; and (ii) a direction to consider deemed generation benefits to the solar power plants for the loss of 
generation due to backing down instructions of the respondents under regulation 2(q), TNERC (Terms and Conditions for Determination of Tariff) 
Regulations, 2015.
APTEL’s Order dated 2 August 2021
The APTEL, in its order dated 2 August 2021, held that compensation for deemed generation should be paid for any curtailment / backdown ordered 
other than for grid security reasons (even in the absence of an underlying provision in the PPAs executed by the solar power generators). 
Current Status:
The petition has been admitted and replies to the writ petition has been filed by TNERC and Tamil Nadu SLDC. Rejoinder on behalf of SPVs have 
been filed.

2 Regulatory TNERC, 
TNSLDC 
TNGDCL and 
the State of 
Tamil Nadu
Principal Bench of 
Madras High Court
Background of the Case:
The writ petition has been filed on the grounds that the TN F&S Regulations are arbitrary and hence are violative of Article 14, inter alia, due to the 
following: 
(a) the TN F&S Regulations seek to treat the renewable energy projects (like wind and solar) at par with conventional thermal power stations, 
which is arbitrary, since it is not possible for renewable energy projects to give accurate projections on how the weather condition will impact their 
generation at a given point of time of day;
(b) the TN F&S Regulations have sought to fix the absolute error band at (+ / -10% (ten percent)) which is a much narrower and tightened error 
band 
compared to forecasting and scheduling regulations in other similarly placed renewable energy rich states as well as the Forum of Regulators (FOR) 
Model Regulations (at + / - 15% (fifteen percent)); and
(c) the TN F&S Regulations do not include provisions pertaining to aggregation of generation schedules among pooling substations at the state level, 
which would provide appropriate treatment of impact on grid and apply reasonable 
penalties. 
Current Status:
The petition has been admitted and replies to the writ petition has been filed by TNERC and Tamil Nadu SLDC. Rejoinder on behalf of SPVs have 
been filed.

1 RoW SPICCPL Madras High CourtBackground of the case: 
SPICCPL has filed a writ petition before the Madras High Court challenging the 
correctness and legality of (a) the final findings issued by the Directorate General of 
Trade Remedies (“DGTR”) dated July 16, 2018 and recommendations on levy of safe 
guard duty on imports; and (b) the notification dated July 30, 2018, issued by the 
Ministry of Finance levying safe guard duty on solar cells and modules consequent to 
the final findings report as stated at point (a) above. 
An interim application was filed by SPICCPL seeking an order of the Madras High 
Court for removal of safe guard duty on the goods imported vide bill of entry dated 
August 2, 2018 and clear the same on a provisional basis without insistence of 
payment of such duty. The Madras High Court relied on the order passed by the High 
Court at Orissa dated July 23, 2018 and issued a stay in the final findings report 
issued by the Directorate General of Trade Remedies and SPICCPL was directed to 
execute a bond for release of imported goods in possession of the authorised officer. 
Since the matter has been filed by SPICCL, the matter is not expected to impact the 
operations of the company. Additionally there is an unlimited indemnity (in terms of 
amounts) against SP for any loss suffered on account of SGD.  
Current Status:
We understand from the Shapoorji team that Madras High Court has vacated the 
DGTR Order and thereafter there has been no-update on the matter.

Background of the Case:
Solar Edge has filed a writ petition dated December 15, 2020 before the Bombay High 
Court against the MERC and others challenging the MERC (Forecasting, Scheduling 
and Deviation Settlement for Solar and Wind Generation) Regulations, 2018 
(“Maharashtra F&S Regulations”) on grounds including, (i) the Maharashtra F&S 
Regulations being arbitrary, onerous in nature and hence violative of Article 14 of the 
Constitution of India, (ii) the charges levied on the renewables project having no 
nexus to the objective of grid security, leading to unjust charges being sought from 
the renewables energy generators. MERC has issued a suo moto notification to 
suspend the application of state periphery charges and have established a commission 
to consider the representation by various renewable IPP.  However, overall DSM is 
continued to be charged and paid by the company.
Current Status:
A group of new petitions raising similar issues were listed before the same bench, and 
MERC’s counsel requested that the current matter be heard along with these petitions 
on 11.01.2024. On 07.02.2024, MERC informed the court that it was in the process of 
finalizing draft amendments to the challenged regulations. Although the matter was 
later scheduled for 06.03.2024 and 27.03.2024, it was not heard on those dates and 
was rescheduled for 07.01.2025. On that date, MERC was directed to file its reply 
affidavits within two weeks, with the next hearing fixed for 11.02.2025. At the 
hearing on 11.02.2025, the deadline to file rejoinders in W.P. Nos. 5153, 5150, 
5121, 5102, and 5171 of 2024 was extended to 25.02.2025. The court also granted 
permission to amend and implead MSEDCL in W.P. Nos. 5211 of 2024 and 73 of 
2025, with amendments to be completed within one week. Reverification was waived, 
and the matter was listed next for hearing on 25.02.2025.

A rectification application has been filed with the jurisdictional Assessing Officer (AO) 
by TL Charanka primarily on the ground that the deduction under Section 80-IA was 
not considered while computing the income during the reassessment proceedings. 
This oversight has led to an inflated tax demand, along with a consequential levy of

Current Status:
Following the rectification, the outstanding demand is expected to become negligible. 
Continuous follow-ups are being made with the AO and the concerned inspector to 
expedite the disposal of the application.

2 Regulatory Gujarat 
Electricity 
Regulatory 
Commission
Supreme Court of 
India
Background of the Case:
GERC's tariff order dated 29 January 2010 set tariffs for solar power projects at INR 
15 per unit for the first 12 years and INR 5 per unit for the next 13 years, based on a 
capital cost of INR 16.50 crores per MW. This applied to projects commissioned by 28 
January 2012. GUVNL filed a petition to revise this tariff, arguing that actual project 
costs were lower due to duty exemptions. GERC dismissed the petition on 8 August 
2013 as not maintainable.
GUVNL appealed to APTEL, which upheld GERC's decision in August 2014. GUVNL 
then filed a civil appeal (C.A. No. 010301/014) against APTEL's order on 27 October 
2014. The Supreme Court has not stayed APTEL's order. External counsel (Trilegal) 
opined that the chances of an adverse order are very limited, so no indemnity was 
sought from the seller.
Current Status:
The matter is currently pending before Supreme Court and has not been listed since 
2017. Matter admitted on 29.02.2024. (During the diligence, external counsel 
(Trilegal) had opined the chances of an adverse order are very limited and 
accordingly no indemnity of any form has been sought from the seller.)
The notice has been issued in the appeals. The appeals have been admitted for final 
hearing. Listed for hearing on 18.12.2024. However, as per the Supreme Court 
website, the captioned Civil Appeal is now tentatively listed on 10.02.2025.

3 Regulatory Direct Tax Comissioner of 
Income Tax (A)
Background of the Case:
1. The company has offered interest income on Foreign Depository Receipts (FDRs) to 
tax under the head 'Business income' on the contention that the investment was 
required to be made due to requirements of the bank for obtaining a loan. Therefore, 
the company has set off its business losses against such interest income. 
2. In the scrutiny assessment, the AO disregarded the Assessee's contention on 
interest income and considered the same under the head 'IFOS'. Further, the AO has 
also not granted business loss under the contention that the business of the Assessee 
has not commenced and hence, the same is a capital expenditure.
3. Also, the AO disregarded assessee's contention regarding cash payment made in 
violation of provision of section 40A(3) and made addition of Rs. 10L.
Current Status:
Appeal pending before the CIT(A).
The company had opted for VSV - Form 4 is filed.

Commissioner of 
State Tax
Background of the Case:
The total ITC as reflected in GSTR-2A was shown correctly in GSTR-9 as Ineligible 
credit and company did not claim any ITC during the said year. Howerver, the AO 
raised notice on it to ask for ITC reversal of the same.                                                
Also, USUPL has correctly deposited the tax on the RCM liability of FY 2018-19 in 
GSTR-3B April-19. Further, please note that the same liability raised by AO which 
was duly paid with interest. (The same also shown under Table-10 of GSTR-9 of FY 
2018-19). Despite that, the AO again raised a demand for the same liability, even 
though it was already paid and disclosed. 
Current Status:
Appeal is being filed, awaiting for hearing.

Supreme Court Background of the case: 
As per the PPA agreement the company is required to meet the annual MSO 
requirement of 98.550 Mn kWh and maintain CUF at 24.5% and 26.5% for a 
consecutive period months during the contract year.In the event such obligations are 
not met, NVVN shall be entitled to a compensation equal to compensation payable by 
DISCOM's for not meeting their renewable purchase obligation (subject to a minimum 
of 25% of the tariff). The company has not been able to meet the requirements as 
the DNI has been lower than the assumed DNI at the time of bidding. The company 
has filed a petitition before CERC requesting an increase in tariff from INR 12.20 per 
kWh to inr 15.00 per kWh claiming that the lower DNI has resulted due to Force 
Majeure and the company should be given relief. The CERC ruled that the shortfall 
cannot be considered as a force Majeure event and increase in tariff cannot be 
granted. Also the NVVN needs demonstrate the amount payable for failure to meet 
RPO obligation The order has been challenged in front of APTEL seeking increase in 
tariff and it has been also challenged by NVVN to set aside the portion requiring them 
to 
demonstrate the RPO shortfall.
Current Status:
As an interim relief, Supreme Court has stayed the APTEL order. The amount of LD 
imposed by NVVN has been now refunded. No further LD is being imposed. 
Matter is pending for hearing.

CERC Background of the case: 
APTEL in order dated 26.07.2022 observed that FERV was a business risk, taken by 
the Generators as the Solar Thermal Technology along with equipment was required 
to be imported which cannot be considered as normal business risk and held such an 
unnatural business risk is akin to Force Majeure. Therefore, APTEL allowed the appeal 
and held all events to be Force Majeure Events and the matter was remanded back to 
CERC to frame suitable mechanism for the purpose of appropriate compensation.This 
matter was re-listed before CERC in terms of APTEL’s directions in judgment dated 
26.07.2022 referred above.

APTEL Background of the case: 
Multiple developers in Rajasthan had filed writ petitions in the Rajasthan High Court 
challenging the constitutional validity of the RERC (Forecasting, Scheduling, 
Deviation Settlement and Related Matters of Solar and Wind Generation Sources) 
Regulations, 2017 (DSM Regulations) notified by the RERC. While the Rajasthan High 
Court in its judgment dated 29 May 2019 upheld the constitutional validity of the 
DSM Regulations, it noted that certain issues raised in connection with the DSM 
Regulations were technical in nature, and therefore, it recommended that the 
petitioners approach the RERC with their grievances regarding the technical aspects 
of the DSM Regulations.Thereafter, the Company filed a petition (Petition No. 1406 of 
2018) before the RERC. The RERC clubbed the petitions filed by the Company and 
other developers in the said matter and disposed of the same through an order dated 
27 September 2019 .The Company in its petition raised concerns in relation to the 
implementation of the DSM Regulations. Thereafter, the Company has preferred an 
appeal against the RERC Order in APTEL on the following grounds: (i) the definition of 
‘available capacity’ in the DSM Regulations (which forms the basis for calculation of 
deviation charges) contemplates only solar PV projects, and not solar thermal projects 
and, therefore the DSM Regulations should not apply to the Project; and (ii) the 
aggregation of scheduling should take place at the state level and there should be 
virtual pooling for the purposes of deviation settlement.

1 RSAPL
Solar Energy 
Corporation of 
India Ltd. 
(SECI) and Ors.
CERC
Background:The CEA issued updated technical standards for grid-connected renewable energy projects 
which included new requirements for reactive power capability and design temperature. These changes, 
outlined in the Working Group Report (2022), imposed additional costs for compliance, including new 
equipment like inverters and capacitor banks. Such new requirements were not part of the original 
bidding documents and resulted in unforeseen additional costs. As these changes qualify as a "Change in 
Law" under the PPA, the petitioner is filed a petition in September 2024 seeking compensation for such 
Change in Law events.
Current Status:The CERC admitted the petitions, issued notices to the respondents, and directed the 
petitioners to provide various affidavits within specified timelines, including details on commercial 
operation status, financial implications of Change in Law events, and compliance with technical 
standards. To which both SECI and RSAPL had filed its reply and the necessary affidavits. The matter was 
listed for hearing on 29.04.2025 and the final order is currently awaited.
2 RSAPL
Solar Energy

CERC
Background:Ministry of Finance vide notification dated September 30, 2021, has notified 12% rate of GST 
on solar PV modules and other renewable energy equipment with effect from October 01, 2021. This rate 
has been increased from 5% (on the date of submission of the bid) to 12%. The parties to the PPAs have 
agreed that any changes in GST rates post-June 22, 2020, which affect project costs, will be treated as 
Change in Law events. Further, Supreme Court's Order dated 19.04.2021 mandated conversion of 
overhead power lines to underground lines and installation of bird diverters in habitats of the Great 
Indian Bustard and Lesser Florican in Rajasthan and Gujarat, increasing setup costs and requiring 
additional authorizations. As these changes qualify as a "Change in Law" under the PPA, the petitioner is 
filed a petition in December 2024 seeking compensation for such Change in Law events.
Current Status:CERC issued its notice dated 19.02.2025, wherein the respondents were directed to file its 
reply within 6 weeks and RSAPL to file its rejoinder within 4 weeks thereafter. The matter will be listed on 
05.06.2025.

Background: As per Regulation 13(3) of CERC (Sharing of Inter State Transmission Charges and Losses) 
Regulations 2020 (hereinafter referred to as "Sharing Regulations") yearly transmission charges shall be paid 
by the generating station only after the associated transmission system (ATS) has achieved COD. Further the 
Sharing Regulations defines 'COD of the ATS' as the COD of the last transmission element of the ATS. 
However as on date all the transmission elements of the ATS are not ready and therefore the Petitioner (i.e. 
RSAPL) is not entitled to be charged any such transmission charges till then. In the light of above a writ 
petition was filed in Delhi High Court for setting aside the invoices raised by Central Transmission Utility of 
India Ltd. (CTUIL) for transmission charges from Dec'23 to March'24. 
Current Status: Following disposal of the Delhi High Court matter CERC proceedings in petition No.
