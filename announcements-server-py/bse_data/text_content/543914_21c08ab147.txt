‘ 
We have reviewed the accompanying statement of Consolidated Unaudited Financial Results of M/s. Swati Projects Limited (the ‘Company” or “Group’) for the quarter ended 30th September, 2025 (the “Statement”) attached herewith, being submitted by the Group pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“the Regulation”), read with SEBI Circular No. CIR/CFD/FAC/62/2016 dated July 5, 2016 (‘the Circular’). 
The preparation of the Statement in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, (Ind AS) 34 “Interim Financial Reporting™ prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 3 of Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, read with the Circular is the responsibility of the Company’s management and has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Company. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
We conducted our review in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagement (SRE) 2410, ‘Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity’ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus provide less assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the applicable Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind As) specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other recognized accounting practices and policies has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of the Regulation, read with the Circular, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material
