Yeah. Thank you, ma'am. Good afternoon and very warm welcome to everyone. On behalf of the 
Sunidhi Securities, I welcome you all to Centum Electronics Limited Q2 H1 FY 26 Earnings Conference

Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
Thank you, Mr. Gulshan, and good evening, everyone. Welcome to our earnings conference call for the 
second quarter and the ﬁrst half of the ﬁnancial year 2026. Let me ﬁrst thank our host of today's 
earnings call at Sunidhi Securities. Let me now take you through the oper ational performance of our 
company for the period under review, followed by which our CFO, Mr. Sundararajan Parthasarathy, will 
brief you on the ﬁnancial performance for the period under review. 
 
During the Q2 FY26, we recorded a robust standalone revenue growth of 18% YoY, supported by strong 
execution in our to Build-to-Spec business for domestic defen ce and space customers. Operational 
eﬃciency and improved revenue mix contributed to EBITDA margin expansion in the quarter as well. 
These gains were primarily driven by the high quality of our Build-to-Spec revenue mix. At the 
consolidated level, EBITDA margins were however impacted by the subsidiary losses. 
 
Our international operations continue to face headwinds in the ﬁrst half of 2026 with weak 
macroeconomic conditions and intense competition in the ER&D market in France. And this has led to 
subdued demand and pricing pressures. We are progressing on the planned divestment of our Canada 
o p e r a ti o n s  a n d  w e  a r e  i n  t h e  p r o c e s s  o f  a l s o  e v a l u a ti n g  t h e  l o n g-term strategic direction of our 
European business in alignment with our longer term value creation objectives. 
 
On the balance sheet front, we continue to invest in CapEx and to enhance capacity to build inventory 
in preparation for the strong order execution expected in H2 of FY26. We continue to see strong order 
book momentum supported by healthy growth in the EMS business from new customers. And also on 
the domestic BTS order pipeline, we continue to see a healthy pipeline remains robust and is expected 
to be a key driver for sustained growth in the coming quarters. 
 
Further, during the period, we strengthened our strategic partnerships. We've received notable 
recognitions. We signed MoUs with GRSE for collaboration on navigation systems for the Indian Navy 
and with BEL to advance indigenous defence electronics across electronic warfare, radar and military

communication systems. We also delivered nearly 400 critical modules for ISRO's recent CMS-3 GSAT-
7R program, underscoring our execution capabilities in space programs. 
 
Our BTS unit also received NABL accreditation , which is further enhancing our credibility in defen ce 
contracts. Additionally, the company was also recognized by CII as an energy eﬃcient unit for 
excellence in energy management for 2025. 
 
Now, I would request Mr. Sundararajan to give you more details on the ﬁnancial performance. 
 
Sundararajan Parthasarathy 
 
Thank you, Mr. Nikhil, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me brief you on the ﬁnancial highlights for 
the second quarter and ﬁrst half of ﬁnancial year ending 2026. At the standalone level for the quarter 
under review, our revenue from operations increased by around 18% YoY to INR 206 crores. EBITDA 
stood at approximately INR 25 crores, registering a 36% YoY growth with EBITDA margins improving by 
154 basis points to 11.97%. PAT came in at about INR 13 crores, reﬂecting a strong 97% YoY increase. 
 
For the ﬁrst half of ﬁnancial year 2026, revenue from operations grew by 24% YoY to INR 391 crores 
and EBITDA for the period was about INR  50 crores marking a 68% YoY rise and EBITDA margins also 
expanded by 338 basis points to 12.88%. PAT for the ﬁrst half stood at INR 29 crores, delivering a robust 
182% YoY growth. 
 
Now coming to the consolidated ﬁnancial performance for the quarter under review, our revenue from 
operations increased by about 12% YoY to INR 291 crores and EBITDA stood at approximately INR 18 
crores which declined by 12% YoY with EBITDA margins also declining by a 165 basis points to 6.16%. 
Proﬁt after tax was reported at INR 4 crores as against a loss of, INR 30 lakh for the same period last 
year. 
 
For the ﬁrst half of the ﬁnancial year 2026, our consolidated revenue from operations grew by 12% 
YoY to INR 564 crores. EBITDA for the period was around INR 41 crores, marking a 14% YoY rise and 
EBITDA margins improved by 14 basis points to 7.22%. Consolidated proﬁt after tax for the ﬁrst half 
stood at about INR 9 crores as against a loss of INR 4 crores of fees in the corresponding period last 
year. 
 
As of September 30, 2025, our borrowings stood at about INR 108 crore that was about 12% increase 
on a net basis after accounting for INR 16 crores of discounted letters of credit. We maintained healthy 
cash balances of INR 136 crores, which includes about INR 76 crores from the Q IP proceeds. And we 
also reduced some subsidiary borrowings by INR 13 crores through waivers and cancellations during 
the quarter. 
 
With this, I now open the ﬂoor for question-and-answer session. Thank you.

Centum Electronics Limited  13.11.2025 
Q2 H1 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
The ﬁrst question comes from Nishita Shanklesha from Sapphire Capital. Please go ahead. 
 
Nishita Shanklesha 
 
Yes, hello. So, I just wanted to understand that on a consolidated level, our margins have dropped. So, 
when are we going to see our subsidiary become EBITDA positive? 
 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
Yes. Thank you, Nishita. I think the point on the subsidiary is clearly a high priority topic we're all 
looking to address. I think as I mentioned during the earlier discussion, with regard to our Canada 
operations, we are quite conﬁdent that we will have a solution very shortly to be able to divest or close 
the business that we have there that's been a contributor for an important part of the losses that we 
have as part of the subsidiary. So that we feel in a fairly short duration in a few months or coupl e of 
months by the end of the quarter, we should have a clear decision on this. 
 
With regard to our Europe operations as well, as I mentioned earlier, we are evaluating various options 
on this front. As I mentioned, the macro scenario today is not favo urable to be able to have a good 
amount of growth, which is what is really needed to improve the margins. But we are taking various 
steps on that front, but also more strategic options are being evaluated. And at this stage, I'm not able 
to share more, but we expect that by the end of Q4, we should have direction on which we will be able 
to build. 
 
Nishita Shanklesha 
 
Okay. Understood. So, once we have more clarity on the Canada and the Europe operations, like, we'll 
be able to say more about when the subsidiary will be EBITDA positive. Right? 
 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
Y es. The objective is that we clearly would like as much as possible to not have any losses from the 
subsidiary impacting our overall numbers in the next ﬁnancial year. So , we are working on various 
diﬀerent actions to be able to address this in the next couple of quarters. 
 
Nishita Shanklesha 
 
Okay. Understood. And if you would like to give any revenue guidance and margin guidance for FY26 
and FY27, that would be great. 
 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
Yeah. I think with regard to revenue, as you mentioned, the standalone numbers have been very strong 
in light of what I've just mentioned, I would focus my comments on the standalone numbers. So, the 
standalone numbers have been very strong. As we mentioned, we're close to 25% for the ﬁrst half. 
 
Also, as usual, our second half numbers typically are higher. And based on this, we are targeting 30% 
growth for the full ﬁnancial year at the end of March. That's with regard to revenue growth on the 
standalone numbers. And with regard to EBITDA margin, again, with the higher sales that we are seeing 
in the second half, we expect by the end of the ﬁnancial year on a full-year basis, we should be in our 
range of between 13% to 15% at a standalone basis for EBITDA.

Understood. Thank you so much. 
 
Moderator 
 
Thank you. The next question comes from Nirmam Mehta from Unique PMS. Please go ahead. 
 
Nirmam Mehta 
 
Hi, Nikhil. So, on our BTS business, while we saw a good growth, our order book has gone down slightly 
from last year or so. Can you just give an outlook f or this business over the ne xt tw o, three years? 
What segments do you see the growth from? Where do you see the business? 
 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
Yeah. I think we're very conﬁdent with regard to what we have in the pipeline. I think the second half 
of the year here as well, we expect to see a very strong order booking. And there are several diﬀerent 
programs that are in advanced stages of decisions. So, we expect between Q3 and Q4 that the order 
book on the domestic BTS side will deﬁnitely increase and we should close at a very healthy pace by 
the end of this ﬁnancial year. 
 
And with regard to more longer , two-year to three-year kind of horizon, as we've mentioned in the 
past, based on our pipeline of opportunities and what is our share and so on, we expect that over a 
three-year period, including this year, we're targeting somewhere in the range of a little over INR 2,000 
crores of order booking in this business. So again, as I mentioned, we've continued to be conﬁdent on 
certain things and we expect some of that to come in within second half of this year. 
 
Nirmam Mehta 
 
Okay. And similarly, can you also present an outlook for the EMS business? How do you see that over 
the next, say, two, three years? 
 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
Yes. EMS also, we would be expecting this year to have a very strong growth again just as we've had in 
the past couple of years. As I mentioned, we have certain new customer additions that we had are 
now in production as of this quarter, which will help drive some of that growth. 
 
And there continued to be several other opportunities that are signiﬁcant, which are in the pipeline 
and we are in a good position to be able to win those. So with all of this, we are seeing a healthy 
pipeline on the EMS front also. You will have, obviously, from year to year or quarter to quarter, some 
ups and downs in one business or the other, but targeting a 30% growth rate in the overall standalone 
business. 
 
Nirmam Mehta 
 
Okay. And lastly, so you mentioned about the decision on the Canada business by end of the month. 
So, w h a t  a r e  w e  t r y i n g  there, transferring the business to the customer or what option are we 
deciding? 
 
6 
Centum Electronics Limited  13.11.2025 
Q2 H1 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
Yeah. As I mentioned, there are a couple of options that remain open and I'm not able to disclose 
exactly what will happen until it's ﬁnally done. But the ﬁrst option is to receive a discussion with a third 
party who's interested in this, and we are in fairly advanced stage of discussions with them. 
 
But if that doesn't work through, then there is a backup solution also from the customer or we may 
also proceed with the court-assisted process for us to exit the business. 
 
Nirmam Mehta 
 
But you do expect a decision in the next one or two months? 
 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
Yes. For sure. 
 
Nirmam Mehta 
 
Okay. Thank you. That's it from my side. All the best. 
 
Sundararajan Parthasarathy

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have any question, please press * and 1 on your telephone 
keypad. 
 
The next question comes from Sai Vijay from Capstocks Securities. Please go ahead. 
 
Sai Vijay 
 
Good evening all. Thank you for the opportunity, sir. My question is regarding the follow -up on the 
inventory that you mentioned on the opening remarks. So, the past six months, inventory levels have 
increased by around 40%, 45% rate. So, is this primarily due to execution of existing orders? Or can I 
be more optimistic and see it as a positive indication for expected order book growth? 
 
Sundararajan Parthasarathy 
 
Yes. These are primarily for the existing orders in both B TS and EMS divisions. There are diﬀerent 
programs that we are working on, execution, and this also would support the statement that we made 
about, how the revenue is likely to ramp up in the second half of this year. And, this increase is kind of 
equally split also between the divisions, so you would see the liquidation coming in  the next six 
months. And this also explains the payables that has also gone up, which will also get liquidated over 
time.

Centum Electronics Limited  13.11.2025 
Q2 H1 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
Yeah. Just to clarify, all our inventory is bought against ﬁrm purchase orders or customer forecast given 
by the customers. So , we don't buy inventory in anticipation of something. It is really against from 
purchase orders or customer forecast. So, just to reiterate what Mr. Sundar has just said, this is clearly 
in anticipation of the higher deliveries that we expect in the second half of this year. 
 
Sai Vijay 
 
Okay. Got it. Sir, I know you may not be able to give a lot of details, but at least if you can just broadly 
speak regarding the opportunity size for space-based surveillance program? 
 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
Yeah. We are obviously tracking various diﬀerent opportunities on that front. I think from our 
perspective, we have seen somewhere in the range of about INR 1,000 crores of opportunities that is 
addressable. Now, I'm not saying we'll be booking that entire INR 1,000 crores, but it is a signiﬁcant 
program. And, you know, I'm sure that we will have orders that we will be booking even in the current 
ﬁnancial year for this program. 
 
Sai Vijay 
 
Okay. Thank you, sir. Thank you so much and all the best to the team. 
 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
Thank you.

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have any question, please press * and 1 on your telephone 
keypad. 
 
The next question comes from Atul PanPatil from Sunidhi Securities. Please go ahead. 
 
Atul PanPatil 
 
Yes. Thank you for the opportunity.  Sir, I would like to understand how is our order pipeline for the 
European business. We were anticipating some good orders from the European customers, and so I'd 
like to understand what's the status over there? 
 
And we wer e also anticipating some margin improvements in the French subsidiary also. So , if you 
could throw some light over it, it would be really helpful. 
 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
Sure. Yeah. So, as I was mentioning, unfortunately, the uptick in demand has not happened in the way 
that we expected it to with regard to our Europe subsidiary. Basically, there's two eﬀects that we're 
seeing. 
 
8 
Centum Electronics Limited  13.11.2025 
Q2 H1 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
One is, as I mentioned, most sectors are down. There's no major investments happening in the 
automotive side or in some of the other sectors as well, which has caused an impact to lot of the 
players in the ER&D space. 
 
The second thing is, of course, even from a defence standpoint, which is an area that we have a good 
position in, lot of the increased budgets and expenditure is happening in production contracts whereas 
lot of the new projects for design development have been delayed, which is really the area that we 
play in when we talk about engineering services, when it is the new project design and so on that we 
are in. 
 
So, as a result of that, either programs that we were tracking have been delayed or pushed out. And 
on the other hand, due to general macro trend in other sectors, the intensity of competition, margin 
pressures have all also increased in the sectors that we are in. 
 
So, this is the challenge. We are continuing to monitor that and taking certain actions from ﬁrst on the 
cost side to continue to look at where opportunities we have. But as I mentioned earlier, we are taking 
a more holistic review of what strategically we c an take action on with regard to the European 
subsidiary, considering especially the opportunity that we are seeing here in India. So, we're evaluating 
various options on that side. 
 
Atul PanPatil 
 
Right, sir. Yeah. That's it. So, the second question is on the guidance which you had provided for FY26 
that we were anticipating somewhere in the range of 18%, the top line growth and 12% to 13% EBITDA 
margin. 
 
B u t  i f  w e  c ou l d  s e e  f or  H1 FY26, we were able to achieve, of course, due to the challenges in the 
European market and of course, that is the one factor. But the guidance which you had provided of 
around 18%, and we have achieved so far 11% to 12% top line growth. So, how do we see H2 FY26 will 
play out? And are we still maintaining this guidance for FY26? 
 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
Yeah. 
 
Sundararajan Parthasarathy 
 
Yeah. So like we said, on the European side, of course, there is some softness. But on the domestic 
front, we deﬁnitely expect good uptick on revenue for both Q3 and Q4 numbers you've seen in line 
with the orders that we are likely to fulﬁl. So while, of course, it may not be as what you need that be 
stated as far as European business is concerned, if we execute the orders that we have that is quite 
strong pipeline that we have in both BTS and EMS in India, we are likely to not miss that guidance that 
we gave in the past. So, you will see some ramp up coming up. 
 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
Yeah. Second thing like I said, in light of what I was just mentioning, I would like to focus the attention 
on the standalone business, which is really a good story. So there, we continue to maintain guidance, 
if not strengthen that to say that we should at the standalone level grow at 30% for the full year. 
 
9 
Centum Electronics Limited  13.11.2025 
Q2 H1 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
The view on the subsidiary is we will have some degrowth over there. But like I said, we're taking 
certain actions on that front to look at more long-term opportunities. So, the real focus for growth is 
on the standalone business. And on that front, we are quite conﬁdent we will hit the 30% number. 
 
Atul PanPatil 
 
Yes. That's helpful, sir. That's all from my side. Thank you. Thank you so much, sir. 
 
Moderator 
 
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have any question, please press * and 1 on your telephone 
keypad. 
 
The next question comes from SB Bhaiya, an individual investor. Please go ahead. 
 
SB Bhaiya 
 
Hello, sir. Right. I've got two questions, please. First is on the domestic front, right, to achieve a growth 
of 30% for the year, right, you have to achieve a growth of 36% in the second half. So, you are conﬁdent 
about that? 
 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
Yes. I think, ﬁrst of all, with regard to the Build-to-Spec business, this is not a surprise. I think it's not 
only for us, but for most players in the industry, a lot of billing happened in the fourth quarter. So, we 
expect similar things this year as well. 
 
And even on the EMS side of the business, as I mentioned, some of the new customers that we've 
added are getting into production in this quarter. So, we feel quite conﬁdent that we should be able to 
accelerate revenues in the second half. 
 
SB Bhaiya 
 
Okay. That's great to hear. And the second question is, sir, right, we know your focus is to reduce the 
losses of your overseas  subsidiaries, including Canada and European operations. But, unfortunately, 
what has happened in the ﬁrst half is your losses or the overseas subsidiaries have rather increased 
though, what you have done the last year and what you've done this year, I think this year, the PAT loss 
is more this year than the last year's losses. So, how the scenario looks for the second half? 
 
Sundararajan Parthasarathy 
 
So, as far as subsidiaries, when you say it's both Canada and Europe. So in Canada, if we have to say, 
we have reduced the loss for the quarter by a bit in terms of comparing to Q1. Q1, we were about 0.6 
we mentioned last time. So, we're less than that. And Europe is the one that is, in general, on the top 
line troubling us. 
 
For the quarter, of course, it is also a must like a couple of write-backs of liabilities that I mentioned in 
our notes. So with the orders that have been booked in this quarter once the second half if we are able 
to deliver, then there is a possibility that in Europe, we will see a further reduction of losses. And with 
Canada operations, as you mentioned, anyways, on the way out. 
 
10 
Centum Electronics Limited  13.11.2025 
Q2 H1 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
But moreover, in Europe, what happens is in the ﬁrst half, typically, there are a couple of months, May 
and August, where you have a lot of holidays or very, very reduced working days. So in general, H1 to 
H2 ratio will be about 45 % to 55% or 46% to 54% that range normally. So , you would deﬁnitely see 
some improvement coming up in the second half from Europe in terms of bottom line. 
 
SB Bhaiya 
 
So, right, what has been done is done, actually. No problem with that. I would just like to take a 
guidance about, like, how the losses will look like in the second half this year, both actually European 
and Canadian operations taken together if you compare it with the ﬁrst half? 
 
Sundararajan Parthasarathy 
 
Yeah. So, I'm not able to pinpoint and give a guidance in terms of what could be the precise number 
or range. But this much I can tell you that there will be improvement. There'll be an improvement 
based on the orders that we foresee and the pipeline that we have. If those things  convert precisely 
and the cost-eﬃciency actions that we've been taking, it should help us. 
 
Because what we've also done is in terms of the liquidity management and in line with the operation 
eﬃciency, we had worked with the banks and restructured some of the loans. So, that includes -- that 
kind of release the cash stress on the business, which means more liquidity to be able to generate 
more revenue and so on. 
 
On top of it, like, mentioned, there are couple of items on the balance sheet, like borrowings in terms 
of bonds that are being discounted and closed. So that's 1 million oﬀ, and another loan also we kind 
of closed it because it's no longer payable with the bank. So , these actions also will help to manage 
the business well. 
 
And moreover, they have been on their own for the ﬁrst half without any additional infusion support 
and so on. That also is a telling story , and we are in the process of making better bottom line in the 
second half. 
 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
Yeah. I mean, let me be clear about this. There will be a slightly lesser loss than we have had in the ﬁrst 
half. We don't expect to have proﬁts in the second half of the year. We will have, however, a moderate 
loss. 
 
I think there are several factors that will impact ﬁnally what happens here. But right now, not giving a 
very speciﬁc number, but it will be less than the loss we have had in the ﬁrst half. 
 
SB Bhaiya 
 
That's nice to hear, sir. It's such a nice business model and such a nice team. Actually, we expect that, 
right, company's investors also will be happy with whatever your performance, and we have got great 
hopes on it, sir . So I hope, right, it will do better , actually , what you have done in the ﬁrst half . The 
second half will be much better than with 36% growth, which you are envisaging for a standalone year 
and lesser losses. 
 
I hope these are really achieved. Thank you, sir.

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have any questions, please press * and 1 on your telephone 
keypad. 
 
We have a follow-up question from Nishita Shanklesha from Sapphire Capital. Please go ahead. 
 
Nishita Shanklesha 
 
Yes. Hello. So, I just wanted to clarify, you mentioned that you have a good order pipeline in the BTS 
business in domestic side. If you could please quantify the order book, like how much is the order 
booking that we're expecting in H2? What is order book size? 
 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
Yeah. So, yeah, you may have seen that as of today, we are roughly around, I think, INR 665 or INR 670 
crores of orders for the domestic Build-to-Spec business. INR 650 crores, sorry. And as I mentioned 
earlier, over a three-year period are looking to book another INR 2,000-odd crores in this business. 
 
So, the visibility is good and this is the kind of booking that we are expecting in the overall business. 
 
Nishita Shanklesha 
 
Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much. 
 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
And also to clarify that typically in Build-to-Spec business, order execution period is in the range of two 
to two and a half years. And so , that's an important input to understanding it. So, that is with regard 
to the Build-to-Spec business whereas on the EMS side of the business, the order book visit, the ﬁrm 
orders can be less than 12 months. In fact, maybe in the range of 10 months or so whereas we also 
have certain customer forecasts for a longer period, which we don't report as part of the order book  
itself. 
 
 
Nishita Shanklesha 
 
Okay. And like, do we have an order book for the EMS business also? If you can quantify that as well. 
Nikhil Mallavarapu

Yeah. The order book for the EMS business is reported in our earnings presentation. It stands at INR 
763 crores at the end of Q2. 
 
Nishita Shanklesha 
 
Okay. Understood. Thank you.

Thank you. The next question comes from Pranav Bastawala, an individual investor. Please go ahead. 
 
Pranav Bastawala 
 
Yeah. Hello, Nikhil. Hello, Mr. Sundararajan. 
 
Sundararajan Parthasarathy 
 
Hello. 
 
Pranav Bastawala 
 
Sorry. I joined late, but just one of few questions. Just one noting I had made that in your subsidiaries, 
in last six months, you have incurred a loss of INR 21 crores, if I'm not mistaken. 
 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
Sounds right. Yeah. 
 
Pranav Bastawala 
 
So, that is one worry that it was discussed that in the second half, something will emerge, and I'm sure 
that negotiations are on. And at least somewhere down the line in this year, somewhere we will either 
swap the leading part, I hope. Because deﬁnitely, it is impacting the consolidated results too much. 
 
Now, my major question is that there are two questions. One is on space that what is happening 
because I see a lot of things are happening from Centum's side or from number of other companies 
like Bellatrix. They are doing lot of representations India , abroad on the space side, but I don't see 
government opening up and doing lot of work on the space, whereas this is a very big potential area. 
So, can you explain where we are? When you expect this thing to materialize? 
 
And my second question is that when I look at the growth of the company , though, now we have a 
sizable order book and everything. When I look at the peers, there are number of other companies 
which are growing much faster. Even I was looking at an unlisted company recently and they are just 
manufacturing something like for Brahmos missile, some components. 
 
Now, such kind of companies are growing by 50%, 60%, 70%, and they may report a number in next 
two years to seem similar to what numbers we are reporting in terms of revenue and much higher 
proﬁtability. So, Centum being such a company in this space, do you think that we need to revisit our 
own plans and we look at our business model wherein we can move and scale up much higher than 
the industry? That's it. Thank you from my side.

Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
Thanks Pranav. Appreciate all the questions again. I think ﬁrst point with regard to the subsidiary, you 
may have missed the initial opening remarks and some of the follow -up questions. But as I was 
mentioning, we are quite close to ﬁnalizing the divestment of the Canadian subsidiary. Things are on 
track to close that in the very short term. 
 
We've also said that with regard to the European subsidiary as well, we are evaluating various strategic 
options to be considered to ensure that we don't continue or retain the status quo of the losses. And 
that as well, we should have a decision on this by Q4, right . So, I'm not able to divulge a lot more at 
this moment because we are actually evaluating various options. 
 
Pranav Bastawala 
 
No issue, sir. You can go ahead with the other questions. No issues. 
 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
Yeah. So, then your second question was with regard to space. So space, yes, there's certainly a lot of 
discussions and activities that have been happening. With regard to Centum at least, our focus has 
been on applications that have largely been oriented towards military programs that has been our 
biggest driver of orders and revenues in the space side. And towards that, we talked about this a bit 
earlier. 
 
W e ha ve a signiﬁcant progr am in the f orm of SBS, space-based surveillance, where we anticipate a 
reasonably good pipeline of opportunities and an addressable market of close to INR 1,000 crores of 
the sum. So, we are taking various actions on that side to be able to address these opportunities as 
they come up. So that's one. 
 
Then in addition to that, there are also certain other things we talked about earlier where we had won 
a signiﬁcant order in the past year for electronic warfare based payloads. Those are in a reasonably 
advanced stage of design ﬁnalization and we expect  that over the next few quarters, those will be 
delivered. 
 
And we have also -- just to give you an idea that the constellation of three satellites for us was close to 
roughly INR 300-crore order. And we have certain indications from the customers that they would need 
more of such constellations. So, that's another opportunity for us. 
 
And then there are also certain other areas within the space domain around situational awareness and 
a l l  of  t h a t  w h e r e  w e  h a v e  a l s o s om e  a c ti v e  p r og r a m s  t h a t  w e  a r e  p u r s u i n g  a n d  w e l l  p os i ti on e d  t o 
capture those. So that's, I would say, the summary. 
 
I would say, in terms of export opportunities, that is something that I would say still at nascent stage. 
But it is something that is evolving very rapidly and we continue to watch and see how we can leverage 
some of these opportunities for export also. 
 
 
 
Pranav Bastawala

Centum Electronics Limited  13.11.2025 
Q2 H1 FY26 Earnings Conference Call 
Okay. 
 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
And then ﬁnally… 
 
Pranav Bastawala 
 
But can I, yeah, please go ahead. 
 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
Yeah. Growth, I think, this is something that we are taking several actions as I said. Even in the current 
ﬁnancial year, by the end, we expect to have reasonably good growth rate. And there are various things 
that we are also working on, which are substantial opportunities in the radar domain, in the electronic 
warfare domain and so on. There are clearly uncertainties in terms of the timelines and all of that and 
so on. 
 
So, we have to be mindful of that. But, as I said, we see a very healthy opportunity pipeline, and we 
continue to focus on going that. So, it's on priority for us and we are very focused on pushing that. 
 
Pranav Bastawala 
 
Can I just ask one more question, if possible? 
 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
Yes, please. Sure. 
 
Pranav Bastawala 
 
Yeah. Thank you. See, you have tied up with the Garden Shipbuilding, recently I came across and read 
that some MOU has been signed. I feel shipbuilding also a very big opportunity. Government wants to 
develop this shipbuilding business. At the same time, electronics plays a very important role. And 
deﬁnitely, this is going to be a very big opportunity. 
 
Are you looking at tying up with some other shipbuilders also? And what kind of opportunity  -- scale 
of opportunity you are seeing? 
 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
Yes. To speak a little bit more about, ﬁrst, the partnership with GRSE itself, this is a speciﬁc system that 
is required for navigation of aircrafts onto ships, basically. It's intended primarily for military 
applications. And typically, it's a system that currently is not installed on almost all of our ships. I think 
there's only one ship in fact that has this. 
 
And it is becoming a requirement that all ships will need this type of system. So , it's a substantial 
opportunity to the tune of maybe around INR  500 crores, INR 600 crores over a period of ﬁve years 
perhaps. And this is where we are working towards, and we feel quite conﬁdent that we should be 
able to convert this and can start in, again, a fairly short duration.

Pranav Bastawala 
 
Nikhil, just one question. Is it a yearly opportunity or a ﬁve-year horizon? 
 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
Five years. 
 
Pranav Bastawala 
 
Okay. 
 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
What I mentioned over ﬁve years, but the orders will come in smaller parts, year by year type of thing. 
 
Pranav Bastawala 
 
Okay. But it can be a bigger opportunity than this over a period of time. 
 
Nikhil Mallavarapu 
 
I mean, this is the ﬁrst thing that we are working with GRSE on. And as things pan out, we will obviously 
look at expanding the scope to see what other products and systems we can bring to bear. You're very 
right that shipbuilding is clearly an area that is a priority and we have good capacity and so on 
established. So, it's a newer area for us, I would say , but it's also an area that we are exploring more 
and more as we go forward. 
 
Pranav Bastawala 
 
Yes. Thank you. Thank you from my side.

We have a follow-up question from SP Bhaiya, an individual investor. Please go ahead. 
 
SP Bhaiya 
 
Nikhil sir, just a small request. I understand you had organized a visit to your work that was only about 
the institutional investors. So , I feel that, right, individual investors should not be declined the 
opportunity of visiting your facilities if you are really organizing that. So, whenever you are doing that, 
I think please consider the participation of individual investors like us . And I think it is sizable 
investment and lot of potential also going forward. 
 
So, just a small request that whenever you are organizing the visit to your work, please do not exclude 
the individual investors who are also potential and believe in you a lot.
