Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended 
To the Board of Directors of Phoenix International Limited 
1. S 
We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of unaudited standalone financial results of Phoenix International Limited 
(the Company) for the quarter ended 30" September, 2025 and year to date from 1™ April, 2025 to 30" September, 2025 ("the 
statement") being submitted by the company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (‘Listing Regulations). 
This statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's management and approved by the Board of Directors, has been 
prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standard 34 
“Interim Financial Reporting" prescribed under section 133 of Companies Act 2013 ("the Act") as amended, read with relevant 
rules issued there under ('Ind As™) and other accounting principle generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 
33 of the Securities Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligation and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 Our 
responsibility is to express a conclusion on the statements based on our review. 
We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standards on Review Engagement (SRE) 2410 "Review of 
Interim Financial Information performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India (ICAT). This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to 
whether the statement is free of material misstatement. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries 
primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A 
review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does 
1ot enable us to obtain in assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit 
Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us believe that the accompanying 
Statement_prepared in accordance_with applicable accounting standards and other recognised accounting practices and policies 
has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the Securities and Exchange Board of 
India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, 
or that it contains any material misstatement.

Independent Auditor’s Review Report On consolidated unaudited quarterly and year to date financial 
results of the Company Pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 
TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF PHOENIX INTERNATIONAL LIMITED 
I We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Unaudited Financial Results of Phoenix 
International Limited (“the Parent”) and its subsidiaries (the Parent and its subsidiaries together referred to 
as “the Group”), for the quarter ended 30" September, 2025 and for the period from 01% April 2025 to 30 
September, 2025 (“the Statement”), being submitted by the Parent pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 
33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended. 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Parent’s Management and approved by the Parent’s Board 
of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in 
Indian Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” (*Ind AS 34”), prescribed under Section 133 
of the Companies Act, 2013, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility 
is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 
2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists of 
making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying 
analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in 
accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we 
would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not 
cxpress an audit opinion. 
We also performed procedures in accordance with the circular issued by the SEBI under Regulation 33 (8) 
of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended, to the 
extent applicable. 
4. The Statement includes the results of the following entities: 
Phoenix Cement Limited (subsidiary of company) and Phoenix Industries Limited (subsidiary of 
company). 
5. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3, nothing has come to our 
attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the 
recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standard and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed 
in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
