Independent Auditor’s Review Report on the Quarterly and Year to date Unaudited 
Standalone Financial Results of the Company Pursuant to the Regulation 33 of SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended 
Review Report to 
The Board of Directors 
VMS TMT LIMITED 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Unaudited Standalone Financial 
Results of VMS TMT LIMITED (the “Company”) for the quarter ended September 30, 
2025 and year to date from April 1, 2025 to September 30, 2025 (the “Statement”), 
attached herewith, being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirement of 
Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015, as amended (the “Listing Regulations”). 
2. This statement, which is the responsibility of the Company’s Management and 
approved by the Company’s Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance 
with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the Indian Accounting 
Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" ("Ind AS 34"), prescribed under Section 
133 of the Companies Act, 2013 as amended, read with relevant rules issued there 
under and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility 
is to express a conclusion on the statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on 
Review Engagements (SRE) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed 
by the Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to 
obtain moderate assurance as to whether the statement is free of material 
misstatement. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, 
primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying 
analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than 
an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does 
not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant 
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit 
opinion.

4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that 
causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with 
the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian 
Accounting Standards (‘Ind AS’) specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 
2013 as amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to 
be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations, including the 
manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement. 
5. The Statement does not include comparative financials for quarter ended 30%" June 
2024 since the company’s equity shares have been listed as on 24! September 2025 
and as per the information and explanation give to us previous period comparative 
is not available. 
Our report on the statement is not madified in respect of the matters.
