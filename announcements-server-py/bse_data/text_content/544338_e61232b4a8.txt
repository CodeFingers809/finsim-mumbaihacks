Independent Auditor's Review Report on Unaudited Standalone Quarterly and Half Yearly Financial Results 
of Capital Infra Trust (formerly known as National Infrastructure Trust) ("the Trust") pursuant to the 
Regulation 23 of the SEBI (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014 (as amended} and SEBI 
Master Circular SEBI/HO/DDHS-PoD~2/P/CIR/2025/102 dated 11 July 2025 
To the Board of Directors of Gawar Investment Manager Private Limited (As the Investment Manager of 
Capital Infra Trust (formerly known as 'National Infrastructure Trust') 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited standalone financial results ('the Statement') 
of Capital Infra Trust (formerly known as 'National Infrastructure Trust') ('the Trust') for the quarter and half year 
ended 30 September 2025, being submitted by the Gawar Investment Manager Private Limited ('the Investment 
Manager of the Trust') pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 23 of the SEBI (Infrastructure Investment 
Trusts) Regulations, 2014 (as amended) (hereinafter referred to as 'the SEBI Regulations') read with the SE6I 
Master Circular SEBI/HO/DDHS-PoD-2./P/CIR/2025/102 dated 11 July 2025 ('SEBI Master Circular'). 
2. The Statement, which is the responsibility of the Investment Manager of the Trust and approved by the Board 
of Directors of the Investment Manager of the Trust, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting ('Ind AS 34'), 
and/ or any addendum thereto as defined in rule 2(1 )(a) of Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 
2015 and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and is in compliance with the presentation and 
disclosure requirements of Regulation 23 of the SEBI Regulations read with the SEBI Master Circular. Our 
responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 
2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the 'ICAI'). A review of interim financial information consists of 
making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical 
and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with 
the Standards on Auditing issued by the ICAI, and consequently , does not enable us to obtain assurance that 
we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion. 
4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 
accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down 
in Ind AS 34, and / or any addendum thereto as defined in rule 2(1 )(a) of Companies (Indian Accounting 
Standards) Rules, 2015 and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the 
information required to be disclosed in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 23 of the SEBI 
Regulations read with the SEBI Master Circular, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it 
contains any material misstatement.

Master Circular SEBIIHO/DDHS-PoD-2/P/CIR/2025/102 dated 11 July 2025 
To the Board of Directors of Gawar Investment Manager Private Limited (As the Investment Manager of 
Capital Infra Trust (formerly known as 'National Infrastructure Trust') 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited consolidated financial results {'the Statement') of 
Capital Infra Trust (formerly known as 'National Infrastructure Trust') ("the Trust") and its subsidiaries (the Trust 
and its subsidiaries together referred to as 'the Group') (refer Annexure 1 for the list of subsidiaries included in 
the Statement) for the quarter and half year ended 30 September 2025, being submitted by Gawar Investment 
Manager Private Limited ('the Investment Manager of the Trust') pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 23 
of the SEBI (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014 (as amended) (hereinafter referred to as 'the 
SEBI Regulations') read with the SEBI Master Circular SEBI/HO/DDHS-PoD-2/P/CIR/2025/102 dated 11 July 
2025 ('SEBI Master Circular'). 
2. The Statement, which is the responsibility of the Investment Manager of the Trust and approved by the Board 
of Directors of the Investment Manager of the Trust, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting ('Ind AS 34'), 
and/ or any addendum thereto as defined in rule 2(1)(a) of Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 
2015 and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and is in compliance with the presentation and 
disclosure requirements of Regulation 23 of the SEBI Regulations read with the SEBI Master Circular. Our 
responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 
2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the 'ICAI'). A review of interim financial information consists of 
making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical 
and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with 
the Standards on Auditing issued by the ICAI, and consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that 
we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion. 
We also performed procedures in accordance with Regulation 13(2)(e) of the SEBI Regulations, to the extent 
applicable.
