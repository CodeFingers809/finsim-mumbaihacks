LIMITED REVIEW REPORT 
To, 
The Board of Directors, 
Acrow India Limited, 
T-27 Software Technology Park, 
Chikalthana MIDC, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar (MH) 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying standalone statement of unaudited financial results of Acrow India 
Limited (CIN: L46411MH1960PLCO11601) for the quarter ended 30th September 2025 and year to date results 
for the period 1% April 2025 to 30'' September 2025 (‘The Statement’) being submitted by the Company 
pursuant to the requirements of regulation 33 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing 
Obligation and Disclosure Requirements) Regulation 2015 as modified, 
2, This standalone statement which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and has been 
approved by the Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with Ind-AS 34- ‘Interim Financial 
Reporting’ prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act., 2013 read with relevant rules issued there 
under and other recognized accounting practices and policies generally accepted in India, Our 
responsibility is to issue a report on these standalone financial statements based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the standalone Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of 
the Entity", issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, This standard requires that we plan and 
perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the standalone financial statements are 
free of material misstatement. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of 
persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review 
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on 
Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all 
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that 
the accompanying standalone statement of unaudited financial results prepared in accordance with 
applicable accounting standards specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 as ammended, 
read with relevant rules made thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and 
other recognized accounting practices and policies has, except as mentioned in para 5 below in the Basis 
for qualified opinion, not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the 
SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 including the manner in which it is to 
be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
