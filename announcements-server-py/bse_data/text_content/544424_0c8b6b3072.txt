SUIT FOR RECOVERY OF Rs.23,81,098/- 
ALONGWITH INTEREST 
JUDGMENT 
PLAINTIFF’S CASE 
1. The plaintiff has filed the present suit seeking recovery of 
Rs.23,81,098/- (Rupees Twenty Three Lakhs Eighty One Thousand 
Ninety Eight only) against the defendant. 
2. Facts as averred in the plaint are that plaintiff is a petty 
contractor/ plumber engaged in works of sanitary installations, laying 
water supply fittings, sewerage system/ fittings together with other 
incidental works. The plaintiff was assigned jobs by the defendant of 
internal and external water supply, sanitary installations, underground 
water pipe line, sewerage drains, rain water harvesting, sewerage 
system external alongwith fancy fittings at its site situated at Indian 
Institute of Management, Lucknow, Noida, B-1, Sector 62, 
CSDIJ no. 8701/16 Pageno. 2 0f 19
Noida-201307, Uttar Pradesh. For assignment of said contract, the 
plaintiff submitted a rate list/ quotation and the said contract was 
awarded in favour of the plaintiff upon receipt of quotation dated 
02.02.2006 by officials of the defendant. Upon that, the plaintiff 
performed the said jobs to entire satisfaction of the engineers and 
supervisors of the defendant besides the satisfaction of Indian 
Institute of Management. The plaintiff carried out the entire 
sanitation/ plumbing job to the best of his abilities through the 
workers deployed by him. Besides the jobs stated to be carried out, 
the plaintiff was also made to carry out some additional jobs by the 
officials of defendant under the assurance that his payments would be 
cleared at the time of final bill. 
2.1 It is further averred that during the course of commencement 
of job, the officials of defendant used to release part payments 
against vouchers and finally, the entire job was completed on 
30.11.2008. Subsequently, as desired by the officials of defendant, 
the plaintiff raised a final bill dated 20.10.2010 for a total amount of 
Rs.26,73,830/- and after deducting the payments already received by 
the plantiff 1.e. Rs.6,13,875/-, a balance amount of Rs.20,60,955/- 
was required to be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff. 
2.2. It 1s further averred that it is mandatory for the contractor 
carrying out plumbing, sanitary and sewerage work, to carry out 
CSDIJ no. 8701/16 Pageno. 3 0f 19
ancillary jobs as per the requirements at the site besides the 
contractual settlements as per the desire of supervisors and engineers 
of the main contractor with understanding that the bills for ancillary 
jobs would be added in the final bill to be raised at the time of 
completion of job. The plaintiff also made endeavor to get the report 
from Noida Authorities after completion of sanitary and plumbing 
work being licensed plumber, under his own signatures. 
2.3 Itis stated that on receipt of final bill, the same was scrutinized 
by the defendant and its officials and based on the bill, the plaintiff 
received communication dated 20.11.2010 from defendant 
mentioning that sum of Rs.1,809/- was outstanding against the 
plamntiff on account of excess payment. Thereafter, the plaintiff 
served legal notice dated 17.02.2011 thereby claiming Rs.20,60,955/- 
together with interest, upon the defendant. Though the defendant did 
not comply with the said legal notice, however, vide its reply dated 
03.03.2011, admitted and acknowledged its liability to pay the entire 
outstanding dues. Despite admitting, the defendant did not release the 
amount to the plaintiff. 
24 On these grounds, the plaintiff is seeking recovery of 
Rs.23,81,098/- (Rs.20,60,955/- as principal and Rs.3,09,143/- as 
interest from 21.10.2010 till filing of the suit). The plaintiff is also 
praying for pendente lite and future interest @18% p.a. against the 
CSDIJ no. 8701/16 Pageno. 4 of 19
defendant. Hence, this suit. 
DEFENDANT’S CASE 
3. Upon service of summons, the defendant appeared and filed 
written statement through its AR Sh. R.N. Jindal, who was duly 
authorized vide Board Resolution dated 15.02.2012, wherein it is 
stated that the allegations leveled through present suit are false, 
incorrect, baseless, absurd and misconceived; that the suit is without 
any cause of action; that the plaintiff has failed to complete the 
assigned work and also left various works which were got completed 
by the defendant by hiring separate work-force; that the bills raised 
by the plaintiff are false and incorrect as no work towards the raised 
bills was ever done by the plaintiff; that the defendant has already 
paid the plaintiff towards genuine bills for the completed assigned 
work. 
3.1 On merits, it is stated that the rate list/ quotation dated 
02.02.2006 was only handed over at the site office without any 
forwarding letter thereof and no such terms and conditions or any 
contract was ever awarded by defendant in favour of the plaintiff. 
The plaintiff has not completed the assigned work properly and left 
the work of C.P. Fittings in toilets and kitchens were not fitted 
properly which resulted in leakage for which the defendant has 
deducted Rs.15,000/- from total amount paid to plaintiff. On request, 
CSDIJ no. 8701/16 Pageno. 50f 19
the plaintiff employed some labourers to complete the abandoned 
work for which payments were made by defendant to said labourers 
and that the said fact is mentioned at serial no. 70 in final bill dated 
20.10.2010. The bills were submitted by the plaintiff after a period of 
two years and that the said bill dated 20.10.2010 was exaggerated 
and the defendant duly clarified the same vide its reply/letter dated 
20.11.2010. It is further stated that vide reply to legal notice dated 
03.03.2011, the defendant made clear that they are not under any

DEFENDANT’S EVIDENCE 
CSDIJ no. 8701/16 Pageno. 8 of 19
8. In defence, the defendant got examined only one witness. 
DWI1 Sh. Vipul Khurana tendered his evidence by way of affidavit 
Ex. DWI/A wherein he made similar contentions as made in the 
written statement. He relied upon following documents:- 
1. Board Resolution dated 10.01.2019 Ex. DW1/D1. 
2. Duly stamped ledger book Ex. DW1/D2. 
3. Work done chart Ex. DW1/D3. 
DW1 was cross-examined by Ld. Counsel for the plantiff. 
Thereafter, matter was listed for final arguments. 
8.1 I have heard arguments addressed at length by Ld. Counsels 
for both the parties and carefully perused the material on record. My 
issue-wise findings are as under:- 
ISSUE-WISE FINDINGS 
Issue no. 5 
Whether the plamtift carried out the work of Rs.20,60,955/-? 
orp 
9. Onus to prove issue no.l was upon the defendant and issue 
no.5 was on the plaintiff. 
9.1 As per plaint as well as deposition made on behalf of the 
plaintiff by PW-1, it is not in dispute that plaintiff was assigned by 
CSDIJ no. 8701/16 Pageno. 9 of 19
the defendant the job of internal and external water supply sanitary 
installation, underground waterline, SW drains, rain water harvesting, 
sewerage system, external alongwith fancy fittings (hereinafter 
referred as plumbing works) at the site situated at Indian Institute of 
Management Lucknow, Noida (hereinafter referred as IIM Noida). It 
is also admitted on behalf of the plaintiff that the plumbing works 
contract was awarded in favour of the plaintiff by the defendant. 
Thus, there can be no dispute to the fact that privity of contract 
existed only between the plaintiff and the defendant and there was no 
privity of contract between the plaintiff and IIM Noida. 
9.2 It has been submitted on behalf of the plamntiff that since IIM 
Noida has issued the certificate dated 15.09.2010 (Ex. PW-1/3) 
wherein i1t was mentioned that plaintiff has executed good quality of 
work at his complex, this proves that plaintiff has completed the 
plumbing work as assigned/ allotted to him through contract by the 
defendant. Per contra, counsel for the defendant has submitted that 
the said certificate is no conclusive proof of the completion of the 
plumbing works by the plaintiff. He further submits that as regards 
the said certificate, PW-2 in his cross-examination has clearly 
mentioned that the said certificate was definitely not any completion 
certificate and that there was no direct link of the plaintiff with IIM 
Noida and that the said certificate was issued in good faith on the 
asking of the plaintiff as plaintiff required the same for his 
CSDIJ no. 8701/16 Page no. 10 of 19
registration in Government Departments. 
9.3  Perusal of the cross-examination of PW-2, who is one of the 
signatory issuing the certificate (Ex. PW-1/3), shows that PW-2 has 
deposed that there was no direct link of plaintiff with IIM Noida and 
that Mr. Manmohan Gupta Executive Engineer working under his 
control brought one typed certificate for his signature to which he 
told that defendant is not working with them directly and as such, are 
not supposed to issue such type of certificate. PW-2 further deposed 
that Mr. Manmohan Gupta told him that the certificate is required for 
getting defendant registered in some the other departments for taking 
sanitary works directly. PW-2 further deposed that sanitary and 
water supply work was done as per satisfactory norms for which they 
recognized defendant only and it 1s the defendant who has to confirm 
to what extent plaintiff has done this work. PW-2 further deposed 
that the certificate (Ex PW-1/3) was not any completion certificate 
and that the said certificate does not make plaintiff to take any sort of 
benefit and that plaintiff has informed that the said certificate is 
required for registration in the Government Departments and since 
plaintiff has done some works, they issued certificate in good faith. 
9.4  Thus, from the aforesaid testimony of PW-2 coming in his 
cross-examination, the certificate (Ex. PW-1/3) does not entail any 
benefit to the plaintiff viz-a-viz the defendant. It is to be noted that 
CSDIJ no. 8701/16 Page no. 11 of 19
since there existed privity of contract only between plantiff and 
defendant, the completion certificate, if any, would be given by the 
defendant only and such document issued by the defendant would be 
material for the claim of plaintiff against the defendant. It is relevant 
to mention cross-examination of PW-1 (who is the grand-son of the 
plaintiff), wherein he has stated that defendant has not issued any 
letter with regard to the satisfaction of the works completed by the 
plaintiff nor did the defendant issued any certificate/ acceptance with 
regard to the completion of the work. He has also deposed that there 
is no written communication to the plaintiff by the defendant asking 
for completion certificate. He also deposed that he is not aware 
whether plaintiff has asked for such a certificate/ acceptance. It is to 
be further noted that there is no pleading to the effect that plaintiff 
has asked for such certificate/ acceptance as at the time of the filing 
of the suit, plamntiff, being alive, has himself filed the plaint 
alongwith the supporting affidavit. The necessary inference is that 
plaintiff has not asked for such certificate nor the same was issued by 
the defendant to the plaintiff. 
9.5 It is further to note that while plamntiff has alleged to have 
raised bills/ invoices Ex. PW-1/2 (colly.), the same were raised on 
regular intervals 1e. on 16.02.2008, 11.03.2008, 18.03.2008, 
16.04.2008, 10.04.2008, 01.07.2008, 01.09.2008 and 25.10.2008. It 
is admitted by the plaintiff that plumbing works had been completed 
CSDIJ no. 8701/16 Page no. 12 of 19
on 30.11.2008, however, the final bill was raised on 20.10.2010. 
There is no explanation as to why final bill was raised nearly after 2 
years of the completion of the works. 
9.6 Even if going by the version of the plaintiff that repair works 
were to be done at the site for a period of 1 year after the completion 
of the work, there is nothing shown by the plaintiff that prevented the 
plamntiff from raising the final bill, that too for an alleged pending 
amount of Rs.20,60,955/-. The amount claimed via bill (Ex. PW-1/4) 
is a huge amount as compared to the amounts in the running bills Ex. 
PW-1/2 (colly) raised by the plaintiff. As to why plaintiff permitted 
such a huge amount to be accumulated, there is no explanation. 
9.7 There is no mention as to how running bills Ex PW-1/2 
(colly.) were approved for payment and by what mode the payment 
was made by the defendant. In the bills Ex. Pw-1/2 (colly.) and Ex. 
PW-1/4, there is a mention of payment being made to some persons 
directly by the defendant. The said persons have not been brought in 
the witness box to prove or corroborate the factum of alleged works 
mentioned in the running bill Ex. PW-1/2 (colly.) and final bill Ex. 
PW-1/4, being done by the plaintiff. 
9.8  Further more, there is no acknowledgment or acceptance of 
the final bill Ex. PW-1/4 by the defendant. Mere issuance of 
CSDIJ no. 8701/16 Page no. 13 of 19
certificate Ex. PW-1/3 by IIM Lucknow/Noida Campus is not enough 
to fasten liability on the defendant since, as already discussed above, 
there was not privity of contract between the plaintiff and IIM 
Lucknow / Noida. 
9.9 Moreover, certificate is not reflective of the complete 
execution of the plumbing works allotted to the plaintiff by the 
defendant. When the plumbing works has been allotted to the 
defendant by IIM Lucknow/ Noida, the issuance of certificate Ex. 
PW-1/3 to the plaintiff, who was employed by the defendant, with no 
privity of contract between the plaintiff and the IIM Lucknow/ Noida 
Campus, does not hold much credibility as far as fixing of liability 
against the defendant or endorsing the claim of the plaintiff, is 
concerned. 
9.10  Merely raising of the final bill is not enough, it needs to be 
proved by evidence that plumbing works for which claim is made by 
raising of final bill Ex. PW-1/4, was done and completed by the 
plamntiff. No positive evidence regarding completion of the work has 
been led on behalf of the plaintiff. There is also nothing on record 
from where it can be inferred that the alleged plumbing works for 
which the claim has been made in the present suit, have been 
accepted or acknowledged by the defendant. 
CSDIJ no. 8701/16 Page no. 14 of 19
9.11 There is no certificate or acknowledgment issued by the 
defendant or its representatives showing plumbing works being 
completed by the plaintiff to the satisfaction of the defendant. 
Moreover, raising the final bill Ex PW-1/4 just after issuance of 
certificate Ex. PW-1/3, also raises a suspicion when there is no 
explanation as to why no bill was raised for nearly 2 years after the 
completion of the work. It is also to be noted that there is complete 
absence of correspondence by the plaintiff with the defendant after 
the completion of work in 2008 till 2010 just after issuance of 
certificate Ex. PW-1/3. The said absence of the correspondence by 
the plaintiff with the defendant also raises suspicion about the 
genuineness of the claim of the plaintiff. 
9.12 In view of the above discussions, the issue under discussion 
stands decided against the plaintiff. 
Issue no. 4 
Whether the platift carried out any additional job to the 
defendant company? OPP 
10.  Onus to prove this issue was upon the plaintiff. 
10.1 In the plaint, plaintiff has averred that he was also made to 
carry out some additional jobs by the officials of the defendant under 
CSDIJ no. 8701/16 Page no. 15 of 19
the assurance that each and every payment would be cleared at the 
time of final bill. The same was reiterated in the deposition tendered 
by way of affidavit by PW1 (who is one of the LRs of the deceased 
plaintiff). In the cross-examination, PW1 has deposed that there was 
no written commitment made by the site Engineers to make 
additional payments of the excess work got done over the site and 
further that he is not aware if instructions for the additional work is 
given in writing or verbally. He has also further deposed that he 
cannot point out the details of the excess work mentioned in the bill, 
however, the details have been mentioned in the bills attached as 
Ex.PW1/4 (Final Bill dated 20.10.2010). 
10.2 In the light of the aforesaid deposition of PW1, on perusing the 
final bill Ex.PW1/4, it is found that there is no specific mention of 
the additional or ancillary works done at the site by the plaintiff, as 
distinguishable from the plumbing works alleged to have been 
allotted to the plaintiff. In the facts and circumstances, it cannot be 
discemed that any additional works/job was done by the plaintiff and, 
therefore, the necessary inference is that it has not been proved that 
plaintiff has carried out additional job at the site. Resultantly, the said 
issue stands decided against the plaintiff. 
Issue no. 2 
Whether the plaintiff failed to complete the assigned works on 
CSDIJ no. 8701/16 Page no. 16 of 19
time and has left some work which was got completed by the 
defendant by hiring separate work force? OPD 
11.  Onus to prove this issue was upon the defendant. 
11.1 In the light of findings on issues no.4 and 5, since plaintiff has 
failed to prove that the plumbing works as mentioned in the final bill 
Ex.PW1/4, were completed by him and also since in view of the 
discussion on issue no.5, there has a reasonable suspicion on the 
genuineness of the said bill, on the balance of probabilities, the 
present issue stands decided in favour of the defendant. Moreover, 
since plaintiff has alleged that the plumbing works were completed in 
all respects by him, no independent witness has been called on behalf 
of the plaintiff, more particularly the labour and/or mason employed 
by the plantiff to execute the sanitary works. Thus, the present issue 
stands decided in favour of the defendant and against the plaintiff. 
Issue no.3 
Whether the defendant has made full and final payment 
against work done by the plaintifi? OPD 
12.  Onus to prove this issue was upon the defendant. 
12.1 In the light of detailed discussion on issues no.4 and 5, when it 
stands proved that plaintiff has not been able to prove that the 
CSDIJ no. 8701/16 Page no. 17 of 19
plamntiff carried out the work of Rs.20,60,955/- and that plaintiff 
carried on any additional job, the averment and deposition thereof on 
behalf of the defendant to the effect that for the actual works done at 
the site by the plaintiff, payment has been made, has gone unrebutted. 
In view of the same, the present issue stands decided in favour of the 
defendant and against the plaintiff. 
Issuesno. 1 
Whether the suit of plaintiff is without any cause of action? 
OPD 
Issue no. 6 
Whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover the suit amount 
from defendant? OPP 
13.  Both these issues are taken up together being dependent on the 
findings on the other issues framed in the present suit. Onus to prove 
issue no.1 is upon the defendant and issue no.6 is upon the plaintiff. 
13.1 In view of the detailed discussions on the other issues framed 
in the present suit i.e. issues no.2, 3, 4 and 5 and the findings arrived 
thereupon, it can be clearly concluded that suit of the plaintiff is 
without cause of action and plaintiff is not entitled to recover the suit 
amount from the defendant. Accordingly, the issues no.1 and 6 stands 
decided in favour of the defendant and against the plaintiff.
