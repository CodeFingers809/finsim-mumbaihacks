Limited Review Report on the Unaudited Financial Results of the Company for the half year ended on 
September 30, 2025 pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended. 
      
Review Report to, 
The Board of Directors, 
SUYOG GURBAXANI FUNICULAR ROPEWAYS LIMITED 
Mumbai. 
 
We have reviewed the accompanying statement of Unaudited Financial result of Suyog Gurbaxani Funicular 
Ropeways Limited (“the Company”) and its share of the net profit/(loss) after tax for the half year ended on 
September 30, 2025 (“the statement”), attached herewith, being submitted by the Company pursuant to the 
requirement of Regulation 33 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligation and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 read with relevant circulars issued by SEBI. This statement is the 
responsibility of the Company`s Management and has been approved by the Board of Directors, has been 
prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting 
Standard 34, (Ind. AS 34) “Interim Financial Reporting” prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 
2013 as amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles accepted in 
India. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
 
1) We conducted our review in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagement (SRE) 2410, 
“Review of Interim Financial Information performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity” issued 
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform 
the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of Company personnel and 
analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus provide less assurance than an audit. We 
have not performed as audit and accordingly, we do not express as audit opinion. 
 
2) Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to 
believe that the accompanying statement, prepared in all material respects in accordance with 
applicable Indian Accounting Standards (‘Ind-AS’) prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies 
Act 2013, as amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other recognized accounting 
practices and policies has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in term of 
Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligation and Disclosure Requirements) Regulation, 2015, read 
with relevant circulars issued by SEBI, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it 
contains any material misstatement.
