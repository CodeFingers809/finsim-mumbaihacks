One-time impact on India business
Glenmark has a unique, legacy 3-tiered distribution system in India, unlike peer companies
Increasing uncertainties within the distribution channel related to the implementation of 
GST regime change post its announcement on August 15, 2025 
During Q2 FY26, primary sales affected due to one-time reduction in distributor inventory 
levels, postponement of orders, and high impact of freight and reverse logistics
Growth also impacted due to base effect of discontinued tail-end / low-margin products
Starting Q3 FY26, reported growth for India business expected to be in line with secondary sales growth

Driving operational excellence for sustainable value creation
Notes: 
1. The above provisions are basis current estimates of future assets and liabilities; these could be reversed in case of better realizations in subsequent quarters 
2. ROCE = Operating profit / Capital Employed; Capital Employed = Avg. Net worth + Gross Debt
3. ROE = Net profit / Avg. Net worth
4. Peer average - Based on consensus estimates of select listed pharmaceutical companies with a similar business model and geographical presence
These initiatives would help achieve high return 
ratios starting FY26 and beyond
Objective: To enhance overall operational performance and constantly strive to have best-in-class return ratios across 
the pharmaceutical industry
Key changes implemented in provisioning norms / standard operating practices:
1. Created a one-time provision/charge for Current Assets, Debtors & 
Inventories as per prudent accounting principles – to help us reflect the 
true capital efficiency of the core business
2. Discontinued legacy high-cost pre-collections from channel partners to 
improve / sustain overall margins and enhance working capital efficiencies
3. Aiming to bring down Gross Debt to Zero
1. Rewarding IGI management to sustain high-impact R&D outcomes
2. ISB 2001 deal related expenses
3. Liquidation of R&D inventories
4. Impairment and other expenses on account of closure at La Chaux-de-
Fonds (LCDF) manufacturing facility and write-down of current assets

Glenn Saldanha
Chairman and Managing Director
Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd.
“Q2 FY26 reflects the steady progress we are making in strengthening 
Glenmark’s scientific and strategic foundation. The AbbVie partnership for ISB 
2001, along with the income recognised this quarter, is a significant validation 
of our scientific strength and enables us to advance the pipeline in a 
financially self-sustaining way. Across key markets, our performance remained 
resilient. North America delivered continued uptick in performance, supported 
by the expansion of our injectable portfolio and steady execution across 
institutional channels. Europe returned to its growth trajectory, backed by 
recent product launches. In India, GST-related adjustments, given our unique 
three-tiered distribution model, had a one-time impact on primary sales; 
however secondary sales continue to outperform IPM, and we expect reported 
growth to normalize from Q3 onwards. Our specialty and innovation 
businesses progressed several important milestones this quarter including the 
global expansion of RYALTRIS®, the UK launch of WINLEVI®, the regulatory 
and clinical milestones achieved for QiNHAYO
 , and our IGI oncology assets. 
We remain committed to disciplined execution, advancing meaningful science, 
and delivering sustained value for our patients, partners, and all stakeholders.”
