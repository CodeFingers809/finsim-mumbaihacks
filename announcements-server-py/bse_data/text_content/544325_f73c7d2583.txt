EXPLANATORY STATEMENT
Annexed to the Notice dated 24th October, 2025.
Item Nos. 1 & 2 
With the business environment becoming increasingly competitive, equity based long-term incentives are considered as an 
effective instrument for not only attracting & retaining talent which is imperative for the sustained growth of the Company, but 
also for aligning the interests of employees with those of shareholders by ensuring a common purpose towards enhancing 
shareholder value.
It is in this context that various equity based long-term incentives for employees were evaluated and introduction of an  
Equity Settled Stock Appreciation Rights Scheme was considered to be most appropriate. Accordingly,  
the Board of Directors at the meeting held on 24
th October, 2025 decided to seek a limit of two per cent of the issued and 
subscribed Share Capital of the Company for grant of Equity Settled Stock Appreciation Rights (‘ESARs’) under a Scheme  
viz., ‘ITCHL Employee Stock Appreciation Rights Scheme 2025’ (‘ITCHL ESAR Scheme’), to be formulated in accordance 
with the provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Share Based Employee Benefits and Sweat Equity) 
Regulations, 2021 (‘the SBEB Regulations’). The ITCHL ESAR Scheme will be applicable for the employees of the Company 
and its Directors, other than Independent Directors, and also for the employees, including Managing / Wholetime Directors, 
of subsidiary companies of the Company (collectively referred to as ‘the eligible employees’), as may be determined by the 
Board of Directors of the Company (‘the Board’, which term shall be deemed to include the Nomination and Remuneration 
Committee or any other Board Committee). The salient features of the proposed ITCHL ESAR Scheme are provided below:
(a) Brief description of the ITCHL ESAR Scheme
 The ITCHL ESAR Scheme contemplates grant of ESARs to the eligible employees as described in (c) below.  
ESARs would entitle an eligible employee to receive appreciation in the value of the shares of the Company at a future 
date and in a pre-determined manner, where such appreciation would be settled by way of issue and allotment of  
Equity Shares of the Company.
(b) Total number of ESARs to be offered and granted 
 ESARs to be granted to the eligible employees under the ITCHL ESAR Scheme shall not result in issue of  
Equity Shares exceeding, in the aggregate, two per cent of the issued and subscribed Share Capital of the Company 
as on 30
th September, 2025 i.e., up to a maximum of 4,16,54,391 Equity Shares of the Company of ₹ 1/- each  
(such number of shares to be appropriately adjusted for any subsequent bonus issue, consolidation or other  
re-organisation of the capital structure of the Company).
 One ESAR would entitle the eligible employee to apply for and be allotted, upon payment of ₹ 1/- per share, such 
number of Equity Shares of the Company determined on the basis of difference between the market price of  
ten Equity Shares and ESAR Price as described in (e) below, divided by market price of one Equity Share; 
market price for this purpose would be the average of the closing price of the Company’s Share on the  
National Stock Exchange of India Limited (‘NSE’) during the month preceding the month in which the application for 
exercise of ESARs is made by the eligible employee, or such other price as may be considered appropriate by the 
Board.
 If the appreciation settlement results in fraction of an Equity Share, the consideration for such fraction shall be settled 
in cash in accordance with the provisions of the SBEB Regulations and the ITCHL ESAR Scheme.
(c) Employees entitled to participate in the ITCHL ESAR Scheme
 (i) Such employees, including Directors of the Company, other than Independent Directors, as may be determined by 
the Board, and
 (ii) Such employees, including Managing / Wholetime Directors, of such subsidiary companies of the Company, as 
may be determined by the Board.
 ESARs granted to an employee shall not be transferable and cannot be pledged, hypothecated, mortgaged or otherwise 
alienated in any manner whatsoever.

(d) Requirement of Vesting and Period of Vesting
 ESARs under a Grant shall vest as per the following Vesting Schedule:
 • On completion of 12 months from the date of the Grant : 30% of the ESARs.
 • On completion of 24 months from the date of the Grant : 30% of the ESARs.
 • On completion of 36 months from the date of the Grant : 40% of the ESARs.
(e) ESAR Price or Pricing Formula
 The ESAR Price will not be lower than the closing price of the Company’s Share on the NSE on the date of grant, or 
the average price of the Company’s Share during the six months preceding the date of grant based on the daily closing 
price on the NSE, or ‘Market Price’ as defined under the SBEB Regulations i.e., closing price of the Company’s Share 
on the date immediately prior to the date of the meeting of the Board / Nomination and Remuneration Committee in 
which ESARs are granted, as may be determined by the Board, and computed for ten Equity Shares of the Company.
(f) Exercise Period and Process of Exercise
 The Exercise Period shall commence from the date of vesting and will expire not later than five years from the respective 
date(s) of vesting of ESARs.
 ESARs will be exercisable by the eligible employees by making applications to the Company in such manner as may 
be prescribed under the ITCHL ESAR Scheme.
 ESARs will lapse if not exercised within the Exercise Period.
(g) Appraisal Process for determining eligibility of employees
 The appraisal process for determining the eligibility of employees and the quantum of ESARs to be granted to them will 
include (i) grade of the employee, (ii) performance of the employee and the Company as a whole, and (iii) such other 
criteria as may be determined from time to time. The Board will have the absolute discretion to determine the eligibility 
of an employee for grant of ESARs under the ITCHL ESAR Scheme.
(h) Maximum number of ESARs per eligible employee and in the aggregate
 No single eligible employee shall be granted in any financial year, ESARs exceeding 0.05 per cent of the issued and 
subscribed Share Capital of the Company as on 30
th September, 2025.
 The aggregate number of ESARs that can be granted under the ITCHL ESAR Scheme shall not result in issue of  
Equity Shares exceeding two per cent of the issued and subscribed Share Capital of the Company, as stated under (b) 
above.
(i) Maximum quantum of benefit to be provided per eligible employee
 As stated under (h) read with (b) above.
(j) Accounting Policies
 The Company will conform to the applicable Accounting Policies as prescribed under the SBEB Regulations or any 
other policy(ies) that may be prescribed under law with respect to accounting for ESARs.
(k) Valuation Method for ESARs
 The Company will adopt fair value method for valuation of ESARs to be granted under the ITCHL ESAR Scheme, as 
required under the Indian Accounting Standards.
(l) Declaration
 The following declaration required under the SBEB Regulations is not applicable since the Company will adopt fair value 
method for valuation of ESARs:
	 ‘In	 case	the	Company	opts	for	expensing	of	share-based	employee	benefits	using	the	intrinsic	value,	the	difference	
between	the	employee	compensation	cost	so	computed	and	the	employee	compensation	cost	that	shall	have	been	
recognised	if	it	had	used	fair	value	of	the	Stock	Options	shall	be	disclosed	in	the	Directors’	Report	and	the	impact	of	this	
difference	on	profits	and	on	Earnings	Per	Share	(EPS)	of	the	Company	shall	also	be	disclosed	in	the	Directors’	Report.’

acquisition of shares.

SBEB Regulations read with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013.
