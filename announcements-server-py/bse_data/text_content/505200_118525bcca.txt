B.  Govindarajan:  Thank  you,  Mukesh.  Hello,  and  good  evening,  everyone.  I  hope  you  all  had  a  joyful  and

It's

you

today
 
for
 
the

Motors
 
Limited
 
earnings
 
call
 
for
 
the
 
quarter
 
ended
 
September
 
30,
 
2025.
 
 We  have  had  a  very  busy  and  exciting  few  months  with  the  new  launches  and  some  truly  proud  
milestones.
 
We
 
continued
 
the
 
growth
 
momentum
 
forward
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
quarter
 
with
 
a
 
solid
 
performance.
 
The
 
festive
 
season
 
has
 
been
 
particularly
 
very
 
encouraging
 
for
 
us,
 
driven
 
by
 
robust
 
demand,
 
record
 
bookings
 
and
 
the
 
sustained
 
consumer
 
confidence
 
and
 
a
 
clear
 
reflection
 
of
 
brand
 
strength
 
and
 
the
 
market
 
trust
 
we
 
have
 
built
 
over
 
the
 
period
 
of
 
time.
 
 Before  we  move  on  to  the  detailed  business  updates  for  Royal  Enfield  and  VECV,  I'll  begin  
with
 
a
 
broad
 
summary
 
of
 
the
 
overall
 
financials.
 
Coming
 
to
 
the
 
EML
 
consolidated
 
financials
 
for
 
the
 
second
 
quarter
 
of
 
the
 
financial
 
year
 
2025-26.
 
EML

clocked
 
its
 
best
 
ever
 
revenue
 
at
 
INR6,172
 
crores,
 
marking
 
a
 
growth
 
of
 
45%
 
over
 
INR4,263
 
crores
 
from
 
Q2
 
of
 
last
 
year.
 
 On  EBITDA,  highest  ever  EBITDA  for  the  quarter  at  INR1,512  crores  versus  INR1,088  crores

Eicher
 
Motors
 
Limited
 
 
 
November  13,  2025    The  strong  performance  was  a  result  of  an  all-around  growth  across  both  for  Royal  Enfield  and  
VECV.
 
I'll
 
first
 
begin
 
with
 
the
 
business
 
highlights
 
for
 
Royal
 
Enfield.
 
This
 
quarter
 
at
 
Royal
 
Enfield
 
was
 
marked
 
by
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
product
 
actions
 
and
 
refreshes
 
that
 
strengthened
 
our
 
lineup.
 
 To  make  sure  that  our  customers  take  home  their  favorite  Royal  Enfield  motorcycle  this  festive  
season,
 
we
 
have
 
put
 
in
 
considerable
 
effort
 
building
 
a
 
strong
 
foundation
 
and
 
network
 
laid
 
in
 
Q1.
 
We
 
launched
 
3
 
product
 
refreshes,
 
an
 
expansive
 
dealer
 
network
 
of
 
more
 
than
 
2,000
 
stores,
 
which
 
are
 
in
 
operation,
 
and
 
maximized
 
our
 
production
 
capacity
 
during
 
this
 
quarter.
 
 The  GST  reforms  by  the  Government  of  India  have  made  motorcycles  under  350cc  more  
accessible
 
and
 
the
 
customer's
 
response
 
is
 
a
 
clear
 
testament
 
to
 
this
 
during
 
this
 
window.
 
During
 
this
 
quarter,
 
we
 
launched
 
a
 
refreshed
 
Meteor
 
350
 
in
 
India,
 
which
 
is
 
now
 
available
 
in
 
4
 
variants
 
and
 
7
 
stunning
 
colorways.
 
We
 
also
 
added
 
some
 
fresh
 
energy
 
to
 
our
 
lineup
 
with
 
a
 
new
 
Graphite
 
Gray
 
Hunter
 
350
 
and
 
a
 
Shadow
 
Ash
 
Guerrilla
 
450.
 
 This  festive  season  was  truly  an  outstanding  one  for  Royal  Enfield.  And  with  over  about  2.49  
lakh
 
motorcycles
 
we
 
sold
 
during
 
the
 
festive
 
months
 
of
 
September
 
and
 
October,
 
our
 
best
 
ever
 
festive
 
performance,
 
we
 
have
 
achieved
 
a
 
milestone
 
that
 
speaks
 
volume
 
about
 
our
 
momentum
 
and
 
unwavering
 
love
 
riders
 
have
 
for
 
the
 
brand.
 
From
 
refreshed
 
favorites
 
like
 
Hunter
 
350
 
and
 
Meteor
 
350
 
to
 
timeless
 
icons
 
like
 
Bullet
 
and
 
Classic,
 
our
 
motorcycles
 
continue
 
to
 
inspire
 
and
 
bring
 
riders
 
closer
 
to
 
the
 
joy
 
of
 
motorcycling.
 
 During  this  quarter,  we  sold  3,27,067  motorcycles  as  against  2,25,317  in  Q2  FY  '25.  Out  of  
this,
 
in
 
India
 
alone,
 
we
 
sold
 
2,92,703
 
units.
 
We
 
continue
 
to
 
gain
 
market
 
share
 
across
 
board,
 
particularly
 
in
 
the
 
midsize
 
motorcycle
 
segment,
 
where
 
Royal
 
Enfield
 
has
 
been
 
able
 
to
 
continue
 
its
 
dominance
 
at
 
about
 
84%
 
market
 
share.
 
Our
 
focused
 
strategy,
 
combined
 
with
 
a
 
strong
 
product
 
portfolio,
 
marketing
 
activations
 
have
 
helped
 
us
 
deepen
 
our
 
presence
 
in
 
this
 
market
 
during
 
this
 
window.
 
 In  our  international  markets,  our  volumes  stood  at  34,364  units  during  this  quarter.  We  
continue
 
to
 
maintain
 
a
 
strong
 
growth
 
momentum
 
in
 
retail
 
volumes
 
across
 
international
 
markets
 
like
 
Brazil,
 
Nepal,
 
Bangladesh.
 
We
 
maintained
 
the
 
leadership
 
in
 
SAARC
 
markets
 
ranked
 
number
 
2
 
in
 
midsize
 
in
 
U.K.,
 
number
 
2
 
in
 
Argentina,
 
Thailand,
 
Korea
 
and
 
Brazil
 
and
 
number
 
3
 
in
 
Australia,
 
and
 
number
 
4
 
in
 
Italy
 
and
 
France.
 
 This  year  at  EICMA,  we  marked  a  significant  milestone  in  Royal  Enfield's  legacy  as  we  
entered
 
our
 
125th
 
year
 
of
 
pure
 
motorcycling,
 
showcasing
 
a
 
glimpse
 
of
 
our
 
vision
 
and
 
journey
 
that
 
beautifully
 
represents
 
the
 
past,
 
present
 
and
 
future.
 
 We  showcased  some  of  our  most  exciting  motorcycles  yet,  the  special  addition  of  Classic  650,  
the
 
bigger
 
and
 
bolder
 
Bullet
 
650,
 
the
 
Himalayan
 
450
 
Mana
 
Black
 
and
 
Flying
 
Flea
 
S6,
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
lightest
 
and
 
the
 
most
 
advanced
 
scramblers
 
in
 
the
 
EV
 
world.
 
 On  the  customs  front,  we  also  showed  the  Shotgun  and  Rough  Crafts,  a  limited  edition  
collaboration
 
that
 
celebrates
 
the
 
spirit
 
of
 
custom
 
building,
 
something
 
that's
 
always
 
been
 
very
 
dear
 
to
 
Royal
 
Enfield.
 
The
 
response
 
from
 
the
 
global
 
motorcycling
 
community
 
has
 
been
 
truly,
 
Page  3  of  18   

 
Eicher
 
Motors
 
Limited
 
 
 
November  13,  2025   truly  overwhelming,  and  it's  been  wonderful  to  see  how  our  blend  of  heritage  and  innovation  
continues
 
to
 
strike
 
a
 
chord
 
with
 
our
 
riders
 
everywhere.
 
 A  new  Off-Road  Collection,  a  purpose-built  range  of  premium  riding  gear  designed  for  
off-road
 
and
 
trial
 
motorcycling,
 
has
 
been
 
unveiled.
 
We
 
launched
 
Get
 
In-Streets,
 
a
 
collection
 
that
 
blends
 
Royal
 
Enfield's
 
iconic
 
legacy
 
with
 
contemporary
 
everyday
 
wear
 
inspired
 
by
 
travel,
 
exploration
 
and
 
the
 
spirit
 
of
 
motorcycling
 
culture
 
in
 
our
 
lifestyle
 
and
 
apparel
 
space.
 
 During  this  quarter,  our  Flying  Flea,  the  City+  mobility  brand  endorsed  by  Royal  Enfield,  won  
the
 
Red
 
Dot
 
Award
 
2025
 
in
 
the
 
Design
 
Concept
 
category
 
for
 
the
 
Flying
 
Flea
 
C6.
 
It's
 
a
 
proud
 
moment
 
that
 
underscores
 
our
 
growing
 
strength
 
in
 
design
 
and
 
future-ready
 
mobility.
 
 In  the  recently  announced  results  of  the  Dealer  Satisfaction  Survey  2025,  the  Federation  of

Royal
 
Enfield
 
has
 
been

 We  continued  our  course  to  create  a  memorable  riding  experience  for  our  community.  We  
concluded
 
the
 
14th
 
edition
 
of
 
One

2025,
 
our

It
 
was
 
truly
 
an
 
incredible

Over
 
50,000

came
 
together
 
in
 
more

 We  announced  the  return  of  Motoverse  2025,  our  annual  celebration  of  motorcycling  culture  in

 Our  commitment  to  responsible  growth  has  always  been  rooted  in  strong  governance,  
transparency
 
and
 
ethical
 
leadership,
 
and
 
as
 
a

to
 
this,
 
I'm
 
proud
 
to
 
share
 
that
 
Eicher

all
 
the

to
 
load
 
more
 
carrying
 
capacity
 
that
 
addresses
 
both
 
driver
 
environment
 
and
 
operator’s
 
economy,
 
a
 
win-win
 
for
 
both
 
drivers
 
and
 
operators.
 
 We  also  signed  MoU  with  large  charge  point  operators  like  Jio-bp  pulse  and  Tata  Power  to  
provide
 
Eicher
 
trucks
 
and
 
buses
 
customers
 
access
 
to
 
6,000-plus
 
public
 
charges,
 
easing
 
customer
 
anxiety
 
on
 
range
 
and
 
access
 
to
 
charging
 
infrastructure.
 
 Digital  &  Services  grew  very  well  with  My  Eicher  now  supporting  1,62,000  customers  with  
3,75,000
 
vehicles,
 
while
 
VE
 
Connected
 
Solutions
 
progressed
 
on
 
solutions
 
for
 
customers
 
with
 
mixed
 
fleets.
 
 I'm  happy  to  note  that  we  are  having  steady  development  across  our  businesses  with  VECV  
recording
 
several
 
best
 
ever
 
second
 
quarter
 
milestones.
 
We
 
are
 
now
 
at
 
number
 
1
 
position
 
in
 
light
 
and
 
medium
 
duty
 
trucks
 
with
 
sales
 
of
 
10,096
 
units
 
in
 
Q2
 
and
 
a
 
market
 
share
 
of
 
34.8%
 
in
 
this
 
segment.
 
With
 
this,
 
our
 
first
 
half
 
deliveries
 
stand
 
at
 
18,706
 
in
 
light
 
and
 
medium
 
duty
 
trucks
 
versus
 
17,407
 
units
 
during
 
H1
 
of
 
last
 
year.
 
 Our  heavy-duty  truck  volumes  grew  3.5%  in  Q2  in  the  same  quarter  of  previous  year.  Our  
market
 
share
 
in
 
this
 
segment
 
in
 
Q2
 
stood
 
at
 
10.5%.
 
And
 
our
 
deliveries
 
now
 
stand
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
half
 
at
 
9,961
 
units
 
versus
 
9,844
 
units
 
for
 
the
 
previous
 
period
 
in
 
the
 
financial
 
year
 
'25.
 
 We  made  sales  of  3,217  units  in  our  bus  division.  And  with  this,  our  first  half  sales  are  9,222  
units
 
with
 
a
 
growth
 
of
 
1.9%
 
against
 
9,053
 
units
 
in
 
first
 
half
 
'25.
 
In
 
our
 
parts
 
business,
 
both
 
Eicher
 
and
 
Volvo
 
combined,
 
we
 
recorded
 
a
 
robust
 
growth
 
of
 
11.8%
 
over
 
the
 
previous
 
quarter.
 
 Sales  of  Eicher  Pro  X  electric  trucks  continued  to  gain  traction,  even  though  the  overall  
electric
 
vehicle
 
market
 
has
 
continued
 
to
 
be
 
very
 
small.
 
It
 
is
 
just
 
1.5%
 
of
 
the
 
2
 
to
 
3.5
 
tonne
 
market.
 
And
 
within
 
that,
 
we
 
have
 
delivered
 
244
 
units
 
in
 
Q2
 
and
 
436
 
units
 
in
 
H1.
 
In
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
months,
 
our
 
market
 
share
 
in
 
this
 
small
 
market
 
has
 
been
 
24%.
 
 Eicher  tractor  and  buses  exported  1,823  units  in  Q2,  up  61.3%  over  Q2  of  previous  year.  
Despite
 
political
 
disruptions
 
in
 
Southeast
 
Asian
 
markets,
 
YTD
 
exports
 
stand
 
at
 
3,259
 
units
 
against
 
2,322
 
units
 
in
 
H1
 
of
 
previous
 
year.
 
 While  the  market  continues  to  remain  highly  competitive,  VECV  improved  both  our  PAT  as  
well
 
as
 
EBITDA
 
margins.
 
For
 
Q2,
 
our
 
EBITDA
 
stands
 
at
 
INR479
 
crores
 
at
 
8%
 
as
 
against
 
INR395
 
crores
 
at
 
7.3%.
 
Our
 
PAT
 
stands
 
at
 
INR249
 
crores
 
at
 
4.2%
 
against
 
INR208
 
crores
 
in
 
the
 
previous
 
first
 
half
 
at
 
3.8%.
 
On
 
a
 
YTD
 
basis,
 
our
 
EBITDA
 
in
 
H1
 
was
 
INR989.4
 
crores
 
at
 
8.6%
 
versus
 
INR780.4
 
crores
 
at
 
7.5%
 
in
 
the
 
previous
 
year.
 
 And  of  course,  on  October  8,  VECV  announced  an  investment  of  INR544  crores  for  the  
production
 
and
 
final
 
assembly
 
of
 
Volvo
 
Group's
 
globally
 
state-of-the-art
 
12-speed
 
automated
 
manual
 
transmission.
 
This
 
greenfield
 
factory
 
will
 
be
 
established
 
at
 
Vikram
 
Udyogpuri
 
Integrated
 
Industrial
 
Township
 
near
 
the
 
historic
 
city
 
of
 
Ujjain,
 
Madhya

Eicher
 
Motors
 
Limited
 
 
 
November  13,  2025   investment  in  automotive  manual  transmission  production  is  yet  another  milestone  in  the  
17-year
 
plus
 
successful
 
VECV
 
joint
 
venture
 
with
 
Volvo
 
Group
 
and
 
Eicher
 
Motors.
 
 As  the  global  manufacturing  hub  for  Volvo  Group's  5-  and  8-liter  medium-duty  engines  since  
2013,
 
VECV's
 
Pithampur
 
factory
 
has
 
been
 
a
 
pioneer
 
in
 
making
 
in
 
India
 
for
 
the
 
world.
 
Now
 
this
 
will
 
be
 
the
 
second
 
similar
 
initiative
 
in
 
making
 
in
 
India
 
for
 
the
 
world
 
for
 
the
 
automotive
 
manual
 
transmission
 
because
 
most
 
of
 
this
 
production
 
will
 
be
 
exported
 
to
 
Asia
 
and
 
Oceana
 
requirements
 
of
 
Volvo
 
Group.
 
 India's  economy  has  remained  resilient,  supported  by  strong  fundamentals  and  policy  support,  
capex
 
in
 
roads
 
and
 
infrastructure
 
and
 
Make
 
in
 
India
 
incentives
 
supported
 
manufacturing
 
and
 
demand
 
for
 
freight
 
movement
 
with
 
inflation
 
contained
 
at
 
4%
 
and
 
financing
 
conditions
 
stable,
 
and
 
of
 
course,
 
the
 
GST
 
rates
 
rationalization,
 
EV
 
demand
 
held
 
firm
 
through
 
the
 
extended
 
monsoon
 
period
 
and
 
is
 
poised
 
to
 
improve
 
further
 
in
 
H2
 
as
 
projected
 
executions
 
pick
 
up.
 
 As  we  all  know  that  the  industry  has  done  very  well  in  2-wheelers  and  passenger  cars.  Now  the  
consequent
 
positive
 
impact
 
comes
 
on
 
the
 
commercial
 
vehicle
 
because
 
as
 
we
 
have
 
to
 
move
 
more
 
goods
 
and
 
services,
 
you
 
need
 
more
 
trucks.
 
So
 
therefore,
 
we
 
are
 
in
 
a
 
very
 
good
 
position,
 
you
 
can
 
say,
 
for
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
for
 
the
 
commercial
 
vehicle
 
industry
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
for
 
us.
 
And
 
of
 
course,
 
we
 
are
 
looking
 
forward
 
to
 
a
 
good
 
year.
 
 Now  of  course,  thank  you  all  for  being  with  us  on  this  call,  and  we  can  now  move  to  question  
answers.
 
Moderator:  Thank  you  very  much.  We  will  now  begin  the  question  and  answer  session.  Anyone  who

Participants
 
are
 
requested
 
to
 
please

handsets
 
while
 
asking
 
a
 
question.
 
We
 
will
 
now
 
wait
 
for
 
a
 
moment
 
while
 
the
 
question
 
queue
 
assembles.
 
The
 
first
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Chandramouli
 
from
 
Goldman
 
Sachs.
 
Please
 
go
 
ahead.
 
Chandramouli:  My  first  question  is  just  on  the  Classic  and  the  Bullet,  especially  post  the  GST  cuts.  We  
continue
 
to
 
see
 
pretty
 
good
 
volume
 
growth
 
on
 
both
 
those
 
key
 
models,
 
even
 
off
 
a
 
pretty
 
high
 
base
 
when
 
you
 
refresh
 
both
 
those
 
products
 
at
 
this
 
time
 
last
 
year.
 
I
 
just
 
want
 
to
 
understand
 
some
 
of
 
these
 
core
 
products,
 
the
 
Classic,
 
the
 
Bullet,
 
the
 
Hunter,
 
the
 
Meteor,
 
if
 
you're
 
able
 
to
 
give
 
us
 
some
 
sense
 
of
 
what
 
the
 
potential
 
benefits
 
in
 
demand
 
you're
 
seeing,
 
just
 
exclusive
 
from
 
the
 
GST
 
cuts
 
alone?
 
B.  Govindarajan:  Well,  Chandramouli,  first  is  the  Classic  350  has  actually  grown  very  well  during  this  time  
because
 
we
 
kickstarted
 
the
 
campaign
 
on
 
the
 
Classic
 
that
 
has
 
really
 
worked
 
well.
 
People
 
really
 
liked
 
it.
 
That
 
is
 
one
 
on
 
the
 
Classic.
 
If
 
I
 
have
 
to
 
tell
 
you
 
what
 
kind
 
of
 
a
 
growth,
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
grew
 
almost
 
about
 
24.5%
 
compared
 
to
 
last
 
year
 
during
 
this
 
quarter
 
in
 
the
 
Classic
 
350.
 
 The  next  Meteor,  which  you  asked  about,  the  Meteor  350,  we  came  out  with  new  color  ways,  
and
 
we
 
launched
 
it
 
during
 
the
 
September
 
month.
 
Once
 
again,
 
that
 
also
 
has
 
shown
 
us
 
very
 
good
 
growth.
 
If
 
I'm
 
right,
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
have
 
grown
 
almost
 
about
 
30%
 
there.
 
Page  6  of  18   

 
Eicher
 
Motors
 
Limited
 
 
 
November  13,  2025    Hunter,  we  launched  one  more  color  during  this  festive  time.  And  we  also  did  the  HunterHood  
as
 
a
 
platform
 
for
 
all
 
the
 
young
 
audience
 
to
 
come
 
together
 
and
 
then
 
celebrate
 
the
 
HunterHood.
 
And
 
even
 
Hunter
 
has
 
grown
 
almost
 
about
 
41%
 
over
 
the
 
last
 
year.
 
 So  all  the  products,  which  were  on  focus  during  this  quarter,  have  really,  really  grown  very  
well.
 
Bullet
 
350
 
Battalion
 
Black
 
which
 
has
 
really,
 
really
 
grown,
 
I
 
think,
 
almost
 
about
 
70%
 
during
 
this
 
quarter.
 
Chandramouli:  Got  it.  That's  helpful.  The  second  question  is  just  around  the  second  half.  I  think  some  of  your  
peers
 
have
 
indicated
 
the
 
motorcycle
 
industry
 
in
 
India
 
should
 
grow
 
around
 
that
 
8%
 
run
 
rate
 
in
 
the
 
back
 
half
 
of
 
this
 
year.
 
I
 
think
 
Royal
 
Enfield
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
half,
 
domestic
 
market
 
growth
 
has
 
been
 
higher
 
than
 
that
 
run
 
rate?
 
 But  I  just  want  to  understand  how  you're  planning  for  and  thinking  about  the  second  half  and  
how
 
you're
 
thinking
 
about
 
premium
 
motorcycling
 
growth
 
in
 
relation
 
to
 
that
 
sort
 
of
 
high
 
single-digit
 
growth
 
run
 
rate
 
potentially
 
for
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
the
 
industry?
 
B.  Govindarajan:  In  terms  of  percentages,  we  don't  give  the  forward  guidance,  Chandramouli,  but  I  can  tell  you,  
post
 
the
 
GST,
 
the
 
demand
 
and
 
the
 
inquiry
 
and
 
the
 
demand
 
is
 
holding
 
up
 
really
 
very
 
well
 
for
 
us.
 
Even
 
October
 
has
 
been
 
very
 
good.
 
As
 
I
 
mentioned,
 
all
 
the
 
product
 
interventions,
 
inventory
 
buildup,
 
everything
 
has
 
worked.
 
And
 
currently,
 
even
 
in
 
the
 
month
 
of
 
November,
 
I'm
 
seeing
 
the
 
run
 
rates
 
are
 
very
 
good.
 
So
 
we
 
are
 
bullish
 
that
 
our
 
growth
 
rate
 
continues.
 
Chandramouli:  Got  it.  And  just  lastly,  in  terms  of  channel  inventory  and  production  run  rates,  if  I  just  look  at  
your
 
first
 
half
 
wholesale
 
growth
 
in
 
the
 
domestic
 
market,
 
you've
 
grown
 
about
 
27%
 
versus
 
retail,
 
at
 
least
 
on
 
my
 
end,
 
seems
 
to
 
be
 
close
 
to
 
24%.
 
And
 
in
 
the
 
month
 
of
 
October,
 
it
 
seems
 
to
 
be
 
--
 
retail
 
has
 
grown
 
closer
 
to
 
50%,
 
but
 
wholesale
 
only
 
15%.
 
 So  are  you  thinking  about  sort  of  staking  up  the  channel?  What  is  the  current  channel  
inventory
 
you
 
have?
 
And
 
are
 
there
 
any
 
near-term
 
risks
 
of
 
potential
 
stock
 
out
 
just
 
given
 
retail
 
so
 
far
 
this
 
third
 
quarter
 
seems
 
to
 
have
 
grown
 
much
 
faster
 
than
 
wholesale?
 
B.  Govindarajan:  Yes.  So  normally,  as  you  all  know,  during  the  festive  season,  the  inventory  build  takes  place  
and
 
the
 
retail
 
will
 
be
 
higher
 
than
 
the
 
wholesale
 
numbers.
 
That
 
is
 
what
 
the
 
season,
 
which
 
has
 
been
 
really,
 
really
 
good
 
during
 
this
 
window
 
of
 
31
 
days
 
festive
 
compared
 
to
 
last
 
year,
 
we
 
actually
 
grew
 
by
 
almost
 
50%.
 
So
 
the
 
growth
 
has
 
been
 
very
 
good.
 
Retail
 
has
 
been
 
holding
 
off
 
very
 
well.
 
 And  we  don't  build  inventory,  you  all  know.  We  would  like  to  actually  have  a  correct  
inventory,
 
and
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
replenishment
 
model
 
back
 
in
 
the
 
system.
 
So
 
that
 
will
 
actually
 
help
 
us
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
velocity
 
in
 
that.
 
Production
 
at
 
the
 
back
 
end
 
is
 
also
 
churning
 
out
 
good
 
numbers.
 
 So  once  again,  you  will  see  some  amount  of  inventory  fill  up,  which  has  to  take  place,  which  
will
 
happen
 
through
 
the
 
wholesale.
 
There's
 
nothing
 
which
 
is
 
alarming
 
to
 
be
 
saying
 
that
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
gross
 
mismatch,
 
Chandramouli.
 
Chandramouli:  Got  it.  Got  it.  Thank  you  very  much  and  all  the  best.

November  13,  2025   B.  Govindarajan:  Thank  you.  
Moderator:  Thank  you.  In  order  to  ensure  that  management  is  enabled  to  take  questions  from  all  the  
participants.
 
Participants
 
are
 
requested
 
to
 
restrict
 
their
 
questions
 
to
 
2
 
per

The
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
the
 
line
 
of
 
Binay
 
Singh
 
from
 
Morgan
 
Stanley.
 
Please
 
go
 
ahead
 
Binay  Singh:  Hi  team,  thanks  for  the  opportunity.  In  your  opening  remarks,  you  talked  about  maximizing  
capacity.
 
Could
 
you
 
share
 
your
 
thoughts
 
on
 
what
 
you
 
are
 
thinking
 
on
 
capacity
 
addition
 
incrementally
 
because
 
you're
 
running
 
almost
 
at
 
full
 
capacity?
 
B.  Govindarajan:  Yes.  So  Binay,  in  the  beginning  of  the  year  also  said,  we  have  our  state-of-art  manufacturing  
facilities
 
at
 
Oragadam
 
and
 
Vallam
 
and
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
Cheyyar
 
plant,
 
which
 
is
 
about
 
60
 
acres,
 
which
 
is
 
supporting
 
these
 
plants
 
with
 
the
 
plating
 
facility.
 
So
 
that's
 
the
 
lay.
 
 And  we  said  about  1.2  million  is  the  capacity,  after  build  capacity,  now  it's  peaking  and  it  is  
delivering
 
very
 
well.
 
We
 
also
 
did
 
debottlenecking
 
operations
 
during
 
this
 
quarter
 
for
 
festive
 
inventory
 
buildup.
 
So
 
we
 
have
 
ramped
 
up
 
the
 
capacity
 
to
 
almost
 
about
 
1.3
 
million
 
to
 
1.35
 
million
 
motorcycles.
 
 But  looking  at  the  demand,  looking  at  the  inquiry  and  the  interest  and  what  we  have  done  is  in  
between,
 
we
 
also
 
kickstarted
 
additional
 
module
 
capacity,
 
which
 
will
 
also
 
start
 
kicking
 
in
 
from
 
the
 
first
 
quarter
 
of
 
the
 
coming
 
year.
 
So
 
we'll
 
go
 
in
 
modules.
 
And
 
the
 
next
 
module
 
is
 
also
 
kick-stated.
 
Because
 
we
 
have
 
space
 
in
 
Cheyyar,
 
we
 
don't
 
anticipate
 
any
 
major
 
issues.
 
Binay  Singh:  Right,  right.  And  the  second  question  is  on  the  margin  side.  While  we've  seen  --  like  if  you  see  
revenues
 
have
 
grown
 
by
 
around
 
45%,
 
but
 
the
 
EBITDA
 
growth
 
is
 
around
 
39%
 
because
 
the
 
operating
 
expenses
 
have
 
risen
 
quite
 
sharply.
 
So
 
do
 
you
 
see
 
any
 
scope
 
to
 
reduce
 
marketing
 
or
 
financing
 
or
 
other
 
interventions
 
to
 
sort
 
of
 
have
 
a
 
margin
 
expansion?
 
How
 
would
 
you
 
see
 
that?
 
B.  Govindarajan:  Once  again,  if  I  had  to  tell  you,  maybe  I'm  repeating  the  percentages,  please  don't  see  that  
because
 
that
 
is
 
not
 
what
 
we
 
are
 
driving
 
in
 
aligning
 
the
 
organization.
 
We
 
are
 
looking
 
at
 
an
 
absolute
 
profit,
 
and
 
that's
 
the
 
focus.
 
We
 
want
 
to
 
continue
 
to
 
grow.
 
Growth
 
has
 
to
 
come
 
in
 
from
 
absolute
 
profitability,
 
not
 
on
 
the
 
percentage.
 
 As  far  as  marketing  expenses,  which  we  are  talking  about,  in  fact,  this  year,  the  integrated  
planning,
 
which
 
was
 
done
 
by
 
our
 
marketing
 
team
 
has
 
really
 
helped
 
us
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
good
 
efficiency
 
out
 
of
 
it.
 
 But  you  will  continue  to  see  our  market  activations,  brand-building  activities  and  launch  
expenses
 
that
 
will
 
continue,
 
including
 
expenses
 
like
 
community
 
building
 
like
 
Motoverse
 
HunterHood,
 
our
 
drag
 
races
 
of
 
Guerrilla
 
and
 
Classic
 
campaign
 
that
 
all
 
will
 
continue.
 
So
 
there
 
will
 
be
 
expenses
 
which
 
will
 
be
 
there
 
in
 
the
 
marketing
 
area.
 
Binay  Singh:  Ok,  thanks.  I  will  come  back  in  the  queue.  
Moderator:  Thank  you.  The  next  question  comes  from  the  line  of  Amyn  Pirani  from  JP  Morgan.  Please  go  
ahead.
 
Page  8  of  18   

 
Eicher
 
Motors
 
Limited
 
 
 
November  13,  2025   Amyn  Pirani:  Hi,  thanks  for  the  opportunity.  Actually,  my  first  question  is  also  on  the  profitability.  It  looks  
like
 
this
 
quarter,
 
there
 
has
 
been
 
a
 
big
 
gap
 
in
 
the
 
movement
 
in
 
consolidated
 
and
 
standalone.
 
And
 
it
 
looks
 
like
 
your
 
subsidiaries
 
may
 
have
 
turned
 
close
 
to
 
INR40
 
crores
 
EBITDA
 
profit,
 
which
 
is
 
generally
 
a
 
negative
 
number.
 
 So  I  just  wanted  to  understand  if  something  is  happening  there?  Are  some  of  the  subsidiaries  
turning
 
profitable?
 
Is
 
some
 
of
 
this
 
to
 
do
 
with
 
Brazil
 
where
 
you've
 
been
 
ramping
 
up?
 
Some
 
color
 
there
 
would
 
be
 
helpful?
 
Vidhya  Srinivasan:  Yeah  so  I  mean,  to  some  extent,  there  is  a  bit  of  a  mix  change  which  is  happening  between  Q1  
and
 
Q2.
 
Typically,
 
the
 
way
 
it
 
works
 
out
 
for
 
us
 
is
 
Q1
 
and
 
Q4,
 
we
 
are
 
ramping
 
up,
 
and
 
we
 
are
 
spending.
 
We
 
are
 
exporting
 
to
 
essentially
 
the
 
developed
 
markets.
 
And
 
in
 
Q2,
 
Q3,
 
it's
 
largely
 
around
 
CKD
 
and
 
things
 
like
 
that.
 
 So  I  wouldn't  say  that  there  is  any  big  jump  up,  which  takes  place  between  subsidiaries  and  
there's
 
no
 
major
 
dramatic
 
development.
 
It's
 
essentially
 
the
 
timing
 
and
 
it's
 
the
 
mix
 
of
 
markets,
 
etc.,
 
which
 
is
 
showing
 
it,
 
yeah.
 
So
 
nothing,
 
it's
 
really
 
that
 
there
 
will
 
be
 
more
 
sales
 
happening
 
in
 
the
 
subsidiaries
 
because
 
typically,
 
we
 
take
 
the
 
reversal
 
of
 
profits,
 
as
 
you
 
know,
 
from
 
India.
 
B.  Govindarajan:  Amyn,  as  Vidhya  was  mentioning,  all  our  subsidiaries  in  the  last  1,  1.5  years,  what  we  have  
been
 
doing
 
is
 
we
 
have
 
been
 
trying
 
to
 
stabilize
 
all
 
the
 
subsidiary
 
markets.
 
We
 
have
 
been
 
investing
 
into
 
this.
 
And
 
the
 
CKDs
 
are
 
ramping
 
up.
 
There
 
is
 
an
 
efficiency
 
which
 
is
 
coming
 
in.
 
This
 
is
 
also
 
flowing
 
into
 
the
 
subsidiary
 
profitability.
 
But
 
you
 
will
 
see
 
it
 
over
 
the
 
period
 
of
 
time
 
when
 
the
 
volume
 
goes
 
up
 
further.
 
Amyn  Pirani:  Okay,  okay.  That's  helpful.  Secondly,  on  VECV,  first  of  all,  thank  you  for  giving  the  detailed  
financials
 
at
 
this
 
time
 
in
 
the
 
PPT.
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
will
 
be
 
very
 
helpful
 
for
 
us
 
going
 
forward.
 
So
 
just
 
on
 
VECV,
 
I
 
wanted
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
sense
 
as
 
to
 
how
 
the
 
volume
 
outlook
 
looked.
 
You
 
did
 
mention
 
some
 
improvement,
 
but
 
we've
 
seen
 
in
 
the
 
industry
 
that
 
while
 
margins
 
have
 
improved
 
for
 
almost
 
all
 
the
 
players,
 
the
 
volume
 
growth
 
has
 
been
 
sideways
 
just
 
in
 
low
 
single
 
digits?
 
 So  as  we  look  into  the  next  2  to  3  quarters,  are  there  any  specific  areas  where  we  could  see  
signs
 
of
 
volume
 
recovery?
 
And
 
how
 
should
 
we
 
think
 
about
 
margins
 
going
 
forward
 
after
 
the
 
improvement
 
that
 
we've
 
seen
 
in
 
1H?
 
Vinod  Aggarwal:  Like  you  rightly  said,  the  volumes  have  been  a  little  bit  lower  than  the  expectations  in  the  first  
half.
 
However,
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
was
 
also
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
extended
 
monsoon
 
period.
 
And
 
of
 
course,
 
infrastructure
 
investments
 
are
 
happening
 
very
 
well.
 
 And  as  I  mentioned  in  my  address,  you  will  see  the  lag  impact  of  the  GST  rates  rationalization  
because
 
definitely,
 
it
 
has
 
improved
 
the
 
consumption
 
levels
 
and
 
Indian
 
economy
 
driven
 
by
 
domestic
 
consumption.
 
Therefore,
 
we
 
will
 
see
 
a
 
good
 
impact
 
on
 
the
 
economy,
 
and
 
interest
 
rates
 
are
 
also
 
doing
 
very
 
well.
 
 Inflation  is  down,  replacements  are  strong.  So  therefore,  there  is  no  reason  why  the  volumes  
should
 
not
 
pick
 
up.
 
But
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time,
 
we
 
should
 
also
 
note
 
that
 
in
 
the
 
heavy-duty
 
trucks,
 
Page  9  of  18   

 
Eicher
 
Motors
 
Limited
 
 
 
November  13,  2025   more  and  more  migration  keeps  on  happening  to  higher  tonnage  trucks.  That  also  reflects  in  
our
 
numbers.
 
 And  then  the  second  thing  which  pulls  down  the  numbers  is  the  productivity  levels.  If  you  look  
at
 
the
 
current
 
running
 
of
 
trucks,
 
if
 
earlier,
 
the
 
trucks
 
were
 
running
 
only,
 
say,
 
10,000,
 
12,000
 
kilometers,
 
currently,
 
the
 
trucks
 
are
 
running
 
20,000,
 
25,000
 
kilometers
 
in
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
applications.
 
 So  therefore,  with  the  extended  running,  of  course,  the  numbers  come  down.  But  at  the  same  
time,
 
these
 
trucks
 
will
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
replaced
 
more
 
often
 
because
 
if
 
you're
 
running
 
3,00,000
 
kilometers,
 
then
 
of
 
course,
 
the
 
heavy
 
replacement
 
period
 
will
 
come
 
down.
 
So
 
that
 
will
 
reflect
 
in
 
the
 
future
 
demand.
 
 And  the  third  thing,  which  has  pulled  down  some  of  the  heavy-duty  trucks  demand  is  also  
some
 
migration
 
towards
 
the
 
rail
 
freight
 
corridors.
 
For
 
example,
 
Maruti
 
is
 
now
 
moving
 
almost
 
25%
 
of
 
its
 
cars
 
through
 
rail.
 
So
 
there
 
is
 
some
 
impact
 
coming
 
off
 
that.
 
But
 
in
 
spite
 
of
 
that,
 
we
 
had
 
0.2%
 
growth
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
half,
 
in
 
fact,
 
YTD
 
too
 
for
 
the
 
heavy-duty
 
trucks.
 
 So  therefore,  you  will  not  see  very  large  growth  numbers  in  heavy-duty  trucks.  But  of  course,  I  
feel
 
that
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
will
 
be
 
much
 
better
 
than
 
the
 
first
 
half.
 
As
 
it
 
is,
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
is
 
around
 
55%
 
of
 
the
 
total
 
year.
 
Therefore,
 
you
 
will
 
see
 
better
 
growth
 
rates
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
half.
 
 But  if  you  look  at  light  and  medium  duty  trucks,  the  growth  has  been  good.  Growth  has  been  
9%
 
in
 
light
 
and
 
medium-duty
 
trucks.
 
Exports
 
have
 
grown
 
by
 
40%
 
in
 
first
 
half.
 
Buses
 
are
 
growing
 
by
 
7%
 
to
 
8%.
 
Small
 
commercial
 
vehicles
 
have
 
grown
 
by
 
around
 
6%
 
to
 
7%.
 
So
 
other
 
than
 
the
 
heavy-duty
 
trucks,
 
all
 
other
 
segments
 
are
 
growing.
 
And
 
I'm
 
very
 
positive
 
that
 
overall,
 
we
 
will
 
see
 
good
 
growth
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
half.
 
Amyn  Pirani:  Thank  you  sir.  Thank  you  for  the  detailed  response.  I  will  come  back  in  the  queue.  
Moderator:  Thank  you.  The  next  question  comes  from  the  line  of  Kapil  Singh  from  Nomura.  Please  go  
ahead.
 
Kapil  Singh:  Good  evening  sir .  Just  firstly,  on  the  GST  changes,  I  wanted  to  understand  from  a  consumer  
behavior
 
point
 
of
 
view,
 
any
 
changes
 
you
 
have
 
noticed
 
in
 
either
 
rural
 
or
 
urban
 
growth,
 
if
 
you
 
could
 
give
 
those
 
numbers?
 
And
 
also
 
for
 
the
 
more
 
than
 
350cc
 
portfolio,
 
is
 
there
 
any
 
impact
 
on
 
demand
 
that
 
you've
 
noticed
 
or
 
the
 
impact
 
is
 
not
 
much
 
despite
 
the
 
GST
 
going
 
up?
 
B.  Govindarajan:  Yeah.  So  I  think  it's  a  fantastic  move  by  the  government.  It  has  really,  really  propelled  the  
entire
 
inquiry
 
in
 
the
 
market.
 
The
 
market
 
is
 
buoyant
 
post
 
the
 
GST
 
reduction.
 
For
 
us,
 
when
 
the
 
announcement
 
came
 
in,
 
there
 
was
 
a
 
very
 
good
 
pre-buy
 
taking
 
place
 
in
 
the
 
450
 
and
 
650cc.
 
And
 
now
 
with
 
the
 
reduction
 
to
 
18%,
 
350cc
 
motorcycles
 
are
 
really,
 
really
 
doing
 
well.
 
Festive
 
plus
 
GST
 
and
 
all
 
our
 
actions,
 
it
 
has
 
helped
 
us
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
inquiries.
 
 As  far  as  our  450cc  and  650cc  products.  And  of  course,  the  rate  of  recovery  we  are  just  seeing  
in
 
our
 
650cc
 
is
 
better
 
and
 
450cc
 
is
 
slowly
 
inching
 
up.
 
So
 
it's
 
a
 
matter
 
of
 
time.
 
We
 
can't
 
make
 
any
 
decisions
 
immediately.
 
We
 
may
 
have
 
to
 
wait
 
for
 
some
 
time.
 
But
 
we
 
are
 
cognizant
 
of
 
what
 
Page  10  of  18   

 
Eicher
 
Motors
 
Limited
 
 
 
November  13,  2025   is  happening  and  what  actions  to  be  done.  Nothing  will  be  short  term.  It  will  be  only  long-term  
activities.
 
 So  we  have  also  appealed  to  the  authorities  even  for  our  450cc  and  650cc,  whether  that  can  
also
 
be
 
brought
 
down
 
to
 
18%,
 
so
 
that
 
there's
 
a
 
uniform
 
tax
 
rate
 
which
 
will
 
really
 
help
 
because
 
in
 
India,
 
if
 
we
 
lower
 
these
 
two
 
products
 
I
 
mean
 
if
 
we
 
lower
 
the
 
GST
 
rate
 
of
 
more
 
than
 
350cc,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
good
 
chance
 
of
 
higher
 
volume,
 
and
 
thereby,
 
we'll
 
get
 
a
 
scale.
 
 So  even  in  the  international  market,  it  is  a  true  story  for  a  Make  in  India.  So  we  have  been  
appealing
 
to
 
the
 
government.
 
We
 
will
 
continue
 
to
 
engage
 
with
 
the
 
agencies
 
for
 
lowering
 
the
 
GST
 
rate.
 
In
 
a
 
nutshell,
 
if
 
I
 
had
 
to
 
tell
 
you,
 
450cc
 
and
 
650cc
 
are
 
bouncing
 
back
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
the
 
volume.
 
650cc
 
is
 
better,
 
and
 
450cc,
 
it's
 
a
 
bit
 
slower
 
in
 
bouncing
 
back.
 
Kapil  Singh:  Sure,  sir.  And  on  the  rural  and  urban  growth,  anything?  
B.  Govindarajan:  I  think  it  has  been  growing  across,  to  be  honest,  Kapil.  During  the  festive  time,  the  rural  had  
been
 
slightly
 
higher
 
than
 
the
 
urban.
 
But
 
once
 
again,
 
we
 
have
 
to
 
wait
 
for
 
some
 
more
 
time.
 
But
 
for
 
us,
 
one
 
good
 
thing
 
which
 
has
 
happened
 
during
 
this
 
time
 
is
 
that
 
the
 
South
 
has
 
not
 
been
 
doing
 
very
 
well
 
for
 
us.
 
Now
 
South
 
also
 
has
 
picked
 
up.
 
We
 
have
 
seen
 
very
 
good
 
growth.
 
And
 
East
 
has
 
done
 
really,
 
really
 
well
 
for
 
us
 
during
 
this
 
time.
 
That's
 
at
 
a
 
regional
 
level.
 
Also
 
rural
 
retail
 
growth
 
has
 
been
 
very
 
good
 
during
 
this
 
period.
 
Kapil  Singh:  Okay.  That's  great  to  hear.  And  sir,  one  question  was  on  the  raw  material  cost  to  sales  ratio,  
we've
 
seen
 
an
 
increase.
 
So
 
if
 
you
 
could
 
just
 
help
 
us
 
understand,
 
is
 
this
 
just
 
reflecting
 
the
 
mix
 
or
 
there
 
was
 
some
 
commodity
 
cost
 
pressure
 
as
 
well
 
for
 
the
 
quarter?
 
And
 
anything
 
further
 
that
 
you
 
are
 
expecting
 
on
 
the
 
cost
 
side
 
because
 
we've
 
seen
 
some
 
impact
 
in
 
precious
 
metals,
 
for
 
example?
 
Vidhya  Srinivasan:  Yes.  So  I  think  overall,  from  a  margin  standpoint  and  from  a  commodity  standpoint,  we're  
expecting
 
about
 
40
 
basis
 
points.
 
I
 
mean,
 
we
 
have
 
had
 
a
 
40
 
basis
 
point
 
impact
 
as
 
far
 
as
 
commodity
 
prices,
 
mainly
 
led
 
by
 
both
 
precious
 
metals
 
and
 
aluminum
 
alloys
 
and
 
all
 
that.
 
And
 
overall,
 
I
 
think
 
it's
 
been
 
offset.
 
We've
 
also
 
had
 
a
 
bit
 
of
 
price
 
increase,
 
which
 
has
 
also
 
given
 
us
 
a
 
positive
 
impact
 
of
 
about
 
50
 
basis
 
points.
 
The
 
rest
 
is
 
really
 
a
 
product
 
price
 
mix
 
kind
 
of
 
a
 
thing
 
that
 
comes
 
in.
 
B.  Govindarajan:  So  Kapil,  Inflation  pressure  is  there.  So  there  is  a  headwind,  and  we  are  looking  at  even  the  
precious
 
metal,
 
how
 
do
 
we
 
mitigate
 
it,
 
how
 
do
 
we
 
speed
 
up
 
the
 
value
 
engineering
 
activities,
 
and
 
as
 
Vidhya
 
mentioned
 
on
 
the
 
model
 
mix.
 
So
 
all
 
the
 
levers
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
used
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
inflation
 
pressure.
 
That's
 
the
 
current
 
scenario
 
now.
 
Kapil  Singh:  Thank  you  sir,  that’s  all.  
Moderator:  Thank  you.The  next  question  comes  from  the  line  of  Gunjan  Prithyani  from  Bank  of  America.  
Please
 
go
 
ahead
 
Gunjan  Prithyani:  Hi,  thanks  for  taking  my  question.  Firstly,  on  just  the  new  module  capacity  that  you  said  will  
sort
 
of
 
kick
 
in
 
from
 
1Q,
 
what
 
sort
 
of
 
debottlenecking
 
or
 
expansion
 
are
 
we
 
looking
 
at?

November  13,  2025   the  comments  on  the  post  GST  customer  demand  seeing  a  boost.  Is  there  a  little  bit  more  color  
that
 
you
 
can
 
share
 
as
 
to
 
what
 
sort
 
of
 
new
 
set
 
of
 
customers
 
are
 
coming
 
into
 
the
 
showrooms?
 
 I'm  just  trying  to  gauge  if  there  are  these  first-time  buyers?  Or  are  these  people  who  were  
fence-sitters
 
and
 
with
 
GST,
 
the
 
conversion
 
has
 
just
 
happened
 
much
 
quicker.
 
A
 
little
 
bit
 
more
 
thoughts
 
on
 
the
 
customer
 
buying
 
behavior
 
post
 
GST
 
change?
 
B.  Govindarajan:  So  first,  I'll  address  the  second  question,  Gunjan.  In  terms  of  the  customer  demographic  cut,  
first
 
time,
 
repeat,
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
were
 
all
 
very
 
busy
 
in
 
fulfilling
 
the
 
peak
 
demand
 
which
 
came
 
up
 
during
 
the
 
festive
 
time,
 
and
 
we
 
were
 
having
 
a
 
Board
 
meeting.
 
So
 
we
 
were
 
all,
 
I
 
think,
 
not
 
having
 
enough
 
bandwidth
 
to
 
do
 
the
 
analysis.
 
 But  anyway,  the  team  is  doing,  we  will  go  through  that.  We  will  come  back  maybe  after  a  
fortnight
 
time
 
window.
 
I
 
must
 
tell
 
you,
 
our
 
walk-in
 
conversion
 
has
 
gone
 
up,
 
our
 
tele
 
conversion
 
has
 
gone
 
up,
 
our
 
online
 
conversion
 
has
 
gone
 
up.
 
 So  the  E2B,  we  normally  say  enquiry  to  the  booking  conversion  has  actually  seen  a  10  
percentage
 
point
 
growth
 
during
 
this
 
point
 
of
 
time.
 
It
 
used
 
to
 
be
 
about
 
20%,
 
21%.
 
It
 
has
 
gone
 
to
 
about
 
29%,
 
30%.
 
So
 
the
 
efficiency
 
also
 
has
 
been
 
very
 
good.
 
But
 
to
 
tell
 
you
 
about
 
the
 
whole
 
analysis,
 
we
 
need
 
some
 
more
 
time.
 
November
 
also
 
is
 
holding
 
up.
 
So
 
we
 
will
 
do
 
it
 
in
 
another
 
fortnight.
 
 The  second  one,  which  you  asked  about  the  capacity.  As  we  mentioned,  we  had  built  a  
capacity
 
of
 
about
 
1.2
 
million
 
with
 
a
 
particular
 
mix
 
of
 
our
 
350cc,
 
450cc
 
and
 
650cc.
 
Now
 
what
 
is
 
happening
 
is
 
post
 
GST,
 
the
 
350cc
 
demand
 
is
 
slightly
 
higher
 
than
 
the
 
450
 
and
 
650.
 
As
 
I
 
mentioned,
 
650
 
is
 
catching
 
up
 
faster
 
than
 
the
 
450,
 
but
 
the
 
demand
 
of
 
350
 
is
 
higher
 
than
 
what
 
we
 
were
 
looking
 
at.
 
 So  the  debottlenecking,  which  we  were  talking  about,  is  how  do  we  do  some  operations  
whereby
 
the
 
350cc
 
can
 
be
 
produced
 
in
 
the
 
lines.
 
So
 
that's
 
what
 
is
 
the
 
focus
 
which
 
we
 
did
 
as
 
in
 
the
 
interim.
 
Thereby,
 
we
 
have
 
increased
 
the
 
capacity.
 
And
 
we
 
have
 
added
 
some
 
machineries
 
and
 
equipment
 
and
 
all.
 
 Looking  at  the  current  scenario  of  the  growth,  about  2  months  back,  we  also  kickstarted  
another
 
one
 
module
 
investment,
 
which
 
I
 
said,
 
which
 
will
 
kick
 
in
 
from
 
the
 
first
 
quarter
 
because
 
we
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
prepared
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
festive
 
demand
 
inventory
 
buildup.
 
 But  normally,  what  happens  nowadays  is  the  plant  will  run  at  a  particular  efficiency  during  H1  
and
 
at
 
a
 
particular
 
efficiency
 
during
 
H2.
 
Now
 
we
 
may
 
have
 
to
 
do
 
it,
 
depending
 
upon
 
the
 
inventory,
 
we
 
may
 
have
 
to
 
run
 
the
 
plant
 
continuously
 
to
 
build
 
some
 
inventories
 
till
 
the
 
new
 
capacity
 
kicks
 
in,
 
so
 
that
 
next
 
year
 
growth
 
also
 
is
 
taken
 
care.
 
Gunjan  Prithyani:  But  how  much  will  this  module  add,  which  you  just  referred  to  in  terms  of  capacity?  Does  1.35  
go
 
up?
 
That's
 
what
 
I'm
 
trying
 
to
 
get
 
at.
 
B.  Govindarajan:  Yes,  Gunjan,  it  is  being  looked  at.  It  should  be  higher  than  1.35  lakh.

Eicher
 
Motors

November  13,  2025   Gunjan  Prithyani:  Okay.  Sorry,  1.35  million  per  annum  or  you  are  referring  to  a  monthly  number?  
B.  Govindarajan:  Sorry,  sorry,  it  is  1.35  million.  
Gunjan  Prithyani:  Okay.  Got  it.  That's  clear.  The  second  question,  sir,  I  had  was  on  the  exports  business.  How  
should
 
we
 
now
 
think
 
of
 
growth
 
here?
 
There
 
was
 
a
 
period
 
where
 
we
 
were
 
sort
 
of
 
managing
 
the
 
retail,
 
wholesale,
 
trying
 
to
 
keep
 
the
 
gap
 
to
 
the
 
minimum.
 
That
 
sort
 
of
 
exercise
 
of
 
inventory
 
cleanup
 
to
 
me
 
seems
 
like
 
it
 
is
 
behind.
 
So
 
how
 
do
 
we
 
think
 
about
 
the
 
demand
 
growth
 
on
 
the
 
export
 
side?
 
And
 
any
 
market
 
color
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
give?
 
B.  Govindarajan:  So  our  international  volume  for  this  year  till  date  in  H1,  we  have  grown  almost  about  49%  
compared
 
to
 
last
 
year,
 
which
 
is
 
about
 
78,548
 
motorcycles.
 
The
 
retail
 
is
 
higher
 
than
 
the
 
wholesale
 
once
 
again,
 
and
 
it's
 
holding
 
up.
 
 Brazil  is  a  country  where,  once  again,  it  is  really  showing  it's  a  big  market  outside  India  for  us.  
Our
 
CKD
 
facilities
 
are
 
in
 
operation.
 
We
 
are
 
also
 
looking
 
at
 
establishing
 
our
 
own.
 
And
 
the
 
growth
 
rate
 
is
 
very
 
good.
 
Our
 
products
 
are
 
getting
 
accepted
 
very
 
well.
 
 Both  in  Argentina,  Latin  America,Argentina  and  Colombia  also,  it  is  doing  very  well.  U.S.A.  
tariff
 
situations,
 
we
 
are
 
waiting
 
and
 
watching.
 
Europe's
 
retail
 
is
 
holding,
 
it
 
is
 
catching
 
up
 
now.
 
And
 
the
 
APAC
 
market
 
is
 
yet
 
to
 
bounce
 
back.
 
APAC
 
is
 
going
 
slow
 
only.
 
Still
 
Thailand
 
is
 
not
 
fully,
 
fully
 
sorted
 
in
 
a
 
way
 
as
 
a
 
country.
 
 SAARC  has  been  doing  outstandingly  well  for  us.  During  this  H1,  if  I  have  to  tell  you  where  
we
 
are
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
market
 
share,
 
we
 
have
 
moved
 
to
 
number
 
1
 
position
 
in
 
SAARC.
 
Bangladesh
 
and
 
Nepal,
 
both
 
the
 
countries.
 
We
 
just
 
entered
 
into
 
this
 
market
 
effectively
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
1
 
year.
 
 And  we  retained  our  position  in  the  U.K.,  Brazil,  Argentina,  Thailand  at  number  2,  and  we  
retained
 
our
 
position
 
in
 
number
 
3
 
in
 
Australia
 
and
 
4
 
in
 
Italy
 
and
 
France.
 
And
 
in
 
the
 
EU
 
and
 
Germany,
 
we
 
are
 
in
 
fifth
 
position.
 
And
 
now
 
Germany,
 
we
 
are
 
taking
 
our
 
own
 
subsidiary,
 
which
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
come
 
in
 
full
 
zone
 
operations.
 
So
 
exports,
 
if
 
I
 
have
 
to
 
tell
 
you
 
in
 
one
 
liner,
 
it's
 
in
 
the
 
recovery
 
path,
 
it's
 
in
 
the
 
growth
 
and
 
recovery
 
path.
 
Gunjan  Prithyani:  Okay.  Got  it,   thank  you  so  much.  I  will  join  the  queue.  
Moderator:  Thank  you.  The  next  question  comes  from  the  line  of  Pramod  Kumar  from  UBS  Securities.  
Please
 
go
 
ahead.
 
Pramod  Kumar:  Yeah.  Thanks  a  lot  for  the  opportunity  and  Govind  just  wanted  to  continue  the  demand  trend.  If  
you
 
can
 
just
 
help
 
us
 
understand
 
with
 
the
 
GST
 
cut,
 
what's
 
the
 
kind
 
of
 
customer
 
profile
 
walking
 
in?
 
I
 
mean,
 
have
 
you
 
seen
 
customers
 
who
 
had
 
inquired
 
earlier,
 
who
 
were
 
not
 
converting,
 
coming
 
in
 
and
 
finally
 
making
 
the
 
purchase?
 
Or
 
have
 
you
 
seen
 
a
 
fresh
 
wave
 
of
 
customers
 
coming
 
in,
 
fresh
 
walk-ins
 
or
 
first
 
time
 
walk-ins
 
into
 
Royal
 
Enfield
 
dealerships?
 
 Just  trying  to  understand  how  much  of  this  is  upgrade  demand  which  is  coming  in  from  
customers
 
after
 
the
 
GST
 
cut
 
and
 
how
 
much
 
of
 
this
 
was
 
like
 
kind
 
of
 
a
 
pent-up
 
one,
 
given
 
that
 
Page  13  of  18   

 
Eicher
 
Motors

November  13,  2025   you  always  share  that  your,  what  do  you  say,  mind  share  of  a  consumer  is  much,  much  more  
higher
 
than
 
where
 
your
 
motorcycle
 
market
 
share
 
is?
 
 So  just  trying  to  understand  what  are  the  kind  of  qualitative  differences  you  have  seen  after  the  
GST
 
cut?
 
And
 
also
 
I
 
don't
 
know
 
if
 
you
 
kind
 
of
 
hit
 
this
 
number,
 
where
 
exactly
 
is
 
the
 
channel
 
inventory
 
ex
 
of
 
transit,
 
the
 
latest
 
data,
 
whatever
 
you
 
can
 
share?
 
B.  Govindarajan:  So  first  is  Pramod,  about  the  inquiry  and  booking.  If  I  have  to  tell  you,  not  that  pre-festive,  we  
were
 
having
 
a
 
host
 
of
 
booking
 
and
 
we
 
were
 
waiting
 
for
 
delivery
 
because
 
our
 
production
 
has
 
been
 
very
 
good.
 
So
 
our
 
inquiry
 
to
 
booking
 
ratio,
 
we
 
have
 
been
 
monitoring.
 
Post
 
GST,
 
inquiry
 
to
 
booking
 
the
 
conversion
 
percentage
 
has
 
gone
 
up.
 
 So  booking  was  better  because  obviously,  with  the  GST  reduction,  some  purchases  decisions  
were
 
taken
 
by
 
the
 
customers
 
and
 
it
 
has
 
happened.
 
But
 
currently,
 
if
 
I
 
have
 
to
 
look
 
at
 
just
 
to
 
give
 
you
 
some
 
color
 
of
 
what
 
is
 
happening
 
to
 
the
 
earlier
 
booking
 
to
 
the
 
current
 
booking
 
and
 
how
 
it
 
is
 
moving,
 
the
 
inquiry
 
levels
 
are
 
continuing
 
and
 
the
 
booking
 
levels
 
are
 
continuing
 
even
 
in
 
the
 
month
 
of
 
November
 
when
 
we
 
are
 
talking.
 
 So  the  GST  effect  and  the  new  products  and  our  campaign  effect  is  actually  there.  And  the  
good
 
thing
 
is
 
even
 
in
 
the
 
rural
 
markets,
 
as
 
the
 
question….
 
Anubhav  Bajpai:  There  is  some  background  noise.  
B.  Govindarajan:  Yes.  So  the  funnel,  which  you're  talking  about  an  inquiry  to  booking  to  conversion,  as  of  now,  
it
 
is
 
very
 
healthy.
 
The
 
top
 
of
 
the
 
funnel
 
inquiry
 
is
 
continuing.
 
So
 
that's
 
the
 
sign
 
which
 
we
 
are
 
seeing
 
that
 
everything
 
what
 
we
 
were
 
working
 
on
 
as
 
a
 
lever
 
plus
 
the
 
GST
 
has
 
really
 
helped
 
for
 
350cc
 
motorcycles.
 
 Above  350,  both  450cc  and  650cc,  during  the  GST  announcement  before  September  22,  the  
prebuy
 
has
 
actually
 
been
 
very
 
high.
 
So
 
we
 
stopped
 
it
 
also
 
very
 
well
 
because
 
we
 
were
 
anticipating
 
it.
 
So
 
we
 
stopped
 
the
 
450cc
 
and
 
650cc,
 
which
 
helped
 
us
 
to
 
retail
 
very
 
well,
 
and
 
that's
 
why
 
we
 
could
 
see
 
a
 
50%
 
overall
 
retail
 
growth
 
for
 
us
 
during
 
the
 
festive
 
season.
 
 In  fact,  the  September  to  October  window,  our  450cc  has  grown  by  almost  30%  and  650cc  has  
grown
 
by
 
almost
 
11%
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
previous
 
time,
 
primarily
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
pre-buy
 
which
 
has
 
taken
 
place.
 
Post
 
that,
 
there
 
was
 
a
 
slight
 
dip.
 
 Up  to  650  is  showing  better  and  450  is  slowly  recovering.  It  takes  some  time,  but  we  don't  see  
it
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
major
 
problem.
 
As
 
far
 
as
 
first
 
time
 
buyers,
 
age
 
of
 
that,
 
as
 
Gunjan
 
was
 
also
 
asking,
 
just
 
give
 
some
 
more
 
time.
 
We
 
are
 
doing
 
an
 
analysis.
 
Probably
 
in
 
the
 
next
 
call,
 
we
 
will
 
have
 
a
 
detailed
 
chart
 
on
 
that.
 
Pramod  Kumar:  And  Govind,  the  reason  why  I'm  asking  that  is  basically  there  have  been  talks  about  Royal  
Enfield
 
evaluating
 
a
 
250cc
 
motorcycle.
 
I'm
 
just
 
wondering
 
given
 
the
 
kind
 
of
 
demand
 
lift
 
what
 
you're
 
seeing
 
and
 
given
 
that
 
you're
 
saying
 
even
 
after
 
a
 
record
 
50%
 
retail
 
growth,
 
you're
 
still
 
seeing
 
sustained
 
momentum
 
in
 
November,
 
even
 
as
 
the
 
industry
 
sees
 
moderation
 
otherwise.

November  13,  2025    Does  it  mean  that  you  probably  as  a  company  need  to  think  hard  on  the  250cc  strategy  because  
the
 
GST
 
cut
 
makes
 
the
 
350cc
 
more
 
affordable?
 
So
 
how
 
should
 
one
 
think
 
about
 
this?
 
Because
 
you're
 
already
 
talking
 
about
 
a
 
capacity
 
expansion
 
on
 
the
 
350cc
 
side.
 
So
 
what
 
will
 
be
 
the
 
kind
 
of
 
numbers
 
we'll
 
be
 
looking
 
at
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
volume
 
ramp-up
 
or
 
capacity
 
expansion
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
commit
 
to
 
a
 
250cc
 
foray?
 
B.  Govindarajan:  So  it's  like  this.  Our  focus  as  a  company  will  be  in  the  middle  weight.  We  always  say  the  
middle
 
weight
 
definition
 
is
 
250
 
to
 
750cc.
 
Currently,
 
we
 
have
 
products
 
in
 
350cc
 
and
 
the
 
Sherpa
 
platform
 
450cc
 
and
 
twin
 
650cc.
 
Of
 
this
 
350cc
 
with
 
all
 
the
 
products
 
which
 
we
 
have
 
launched
 
now,
 
especially
 
the
 
Hunter,
 
the
 
new
 
color
 
which
 
we
 
launched
 
and
 
the
 
Guerrilla
 
new
 
color
 
which
 
we
 
have
 
launched,
 
the
 
Meteor
 
new
 
variants
 
which
 
we
 
have
 
launched
 
and
 
the
 
Classic
 
campaign
 
which
 
we
 
did.
 
 And  on  top  of  it,  the  GST  reduction,  it  all  has  helped  us  to  grow  further,  and  we  have  been  
always
 
maintaining
 
that
 
still
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
scope
 
for
 
our
 
350cc
 
products
 
to
 
continue
 
to
 
grow.
 
And
 
the
 
current
 
scenario
 
is
 
it
 
is
 
growing.
 
The
 
task
 
in
 
hand,
 
which
 
we
 
have
 
now
 
is
 
on
 
the
 
450cc
 
and
 
650cc
 
where
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
higher
 
GST
 
rate,
 
which
 
has
 
gone
 
to
 
almost
 
40%,
 
which
 
as
 
I
 
mentioned,
 
we
 
are
 
working
 
with
 
the
 
agencies
 
and
 
the
 
government
 
to
 
reduce
 
it.
 
 That  is  what  we  are  working.  Our  continue  to  focus  on  the  middle  weight  currently,  the  focus  
is
 
on
 
350cc,
 
how
 
do
 
we
 
get
 
the
 
capacity
 
fulfilling
 
the
 
demand
 
which
 
is
 
higher.
 
So
 
work
 
on
 
the
 
back
 
end
 
so
 
that
 
the
 
350cc
 
can
 
be
 
more
 
and
 
more
 
because
 
that's
 
the
 
split,
 
which
 
is
 
required
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
higher
 
number
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
GST.
 
So
 
the
 
current
 
focus
 
is
 
only
 
there,
 
Pramod.
 
Pramod  Kumar:  And  Govind,  when  you  talk  about  350cc  capacity  getting  rejigged  to  a  higher  number,  that  
ideally
 
should
 
come
 
with
 
benefits
 
from
 
sourcing
 
and
 
scale
 
and
 
everything,
 
right?
 
Because
 
it's
 
the
 
same
 
as
 
the
 
existing
 
product,
 
which
 
you'll
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
manufacture
 
more.
 
So
 
ideally
 
that
 
should
 
bring
 
down
 
your
 
unit
 
economics
 
on
 
that
 
particular
 
line
 
up,
 
right?
 
 And  also  any  comment  on  potential  price  hikes  which  you  can  take  in  the  medium  term  
because
 
we've
 
been
 
quite
 
disciplined
 
on
 
the
 
pricing
 
side
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
product
 
more
 
affordable.
 
So
 
but
 
with
 
the
 
kind
 
of
 
demand
 
you're
 
seeing
 
and
 
the
 
kind
 
of
 
traction,
 
should
 
one
 
expect
 
that
 
there
 
could
 
be
 
some
 
pricing
 
action
 
starting
 
with
 
next
 
calendar
 
year?
 
B.  Govindarajan:  So  first  is  about  the  capacity  extraction,  which  you  mentioned,  Pramod.  Yes,  we  have  to  use  all  
the
 
levers
 
now.
 
Though
 
the
 
build
 
capacity
 
can
 
be
 
higher,
 
but
 
the
 
model
 
level
 
350
 
needs
 
more.
 
So
 
we
 
have
 
to
 
do
 
all
 
the
 
levers
 
to
 
be
 
used,
 
including
 
the
 
value
 
engineering
 
activity,
 
including
 
the
 
productivity,
 
including
 
sourcing,
 
make
 
versus
 
by
 
discussions
 
and
 
some
 
investments
 
here
 
and
 
there
 
as
 
a
 
low-cost
 
automation,
 
everything
 
have
 
to
 
play
 
in
 
now
 
immediately
 
because
 
it's
 
here
 
and
 
now.
 
So
 
that
 
activity,
 
which
 
is
 
taking
 
place.
 
 As  far  as  price  increase  which  you  talked  about,  just  because  the  demand  is  higher,  that  doesn't  
mean
 
we
 
should
 
go
 
in
 
for
 
a
 
price
 
increase
 
because
 
that
 
is
 
not
 
what
 
we
 
are
 
as
 
an
 
organization.
 
But
 
there
 
is
 
inflation
 
and
 
there
 
are
 
costs.
 
So
 
we
 
will
 
normally
 
review
 
it
 
once
 
a
 
quarter
 
and
 
which
 
will
 
also,
 
we
 
will
 
be
 
reviewing
 
it.

November  13,  2025    In  the  month  of  April,  we  took  a  price  increase  in  a  few  models  and  then  also  in  a  few  models  
in
 
July,
 
we
 
took
 
a
 
price
 
increase
 
as
 
per
 
the
 
plan.
 
So
 
we
 
don't
 
do
 
anything
 
in
 
the
 
short
 
term.
 
We
 
will
 
review
 
the
 
price
 
value
 
equation,
 
how
 
is
 
the
 
market,
 
how
 
is
 
the
 
inflation,
 
what's
 
the
 
potential
 
which
 
is
 
there
 
and
 
from
 
time
 
to
 
time
 
and
 
quarterly,
 
we
 
will
 
review
 
it.
 
Pramod  Kumar:  Thanks  a  lot.  Wish  you  all  the  best  sir.  
B.  Govindarajan:  Thank  you.  
Moderator:  Thank  you.  The  last  question  comes  from  the  line  of  Yash  Agrawal  from  Nirmal  Bang  
Securities.
 
Please
 
go
 
ahead.
 
Yash  Agrawal:  Good  evening  sir.  Thank  you   for  the  opportunity.  I  just  wanted  to  know  more  about  the  online  
strategy
 
that
 
the
 
company
 
opted
 
for
 
by
 
selling
 
its
 
2-wheelers
 
on
 
the
 
Flipkart.
 
How
 
is
 
the
 
response?
 
What
 
percentage
 
of
 
booking
 
is
 
coming
 
from
 
the
 
online
 
digital
 
channel?
 
B.  Govindarajan:  Go  ahead,  Vidhya.  
Vidhya  Srinivasan:  Yes.  So  basically,  we  have  essentially  kick-started  an  early  pilot  as  it  were  in  a  limited  number  
of
 
outlets
 
during
 
the
 
festive
 
season
 
just
 
to
 
see
 
how
 
the
 
whole
 
price
 
journey,
 
discovery,
 
our
 
traction,
 
etc.,
 
is
 
coming.
 
So
 
it's
 
still
 
early
 
days
 
for
 
us
 
to
 
comment,
 
but
 
maybe
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
add
 
to
 
that.
 
B.  Govindarajan:  So  first  of  all,  as  an  organization,  you  have  to  be  there  in  omnichannel.  So  we  thought  that  we  
should
 
also
 
be
 
there
 
in
 
the
 
e-commerce
 
websites.
 
So
 
that's
 
why
 
we
 
signed
 
up
 
with
 
both
 
of
 
them.
 
And
 
both
 
of
 
them,
 
we
 
are
 
working
 
on
 
an
 
exclusive
 
basis
 
because
 
we
 
have
 
to
 
understand
 
more
 
who
 
the
 
customers
 
are,
 
what
 
are
 
they
 
looking
 
for,
 
what
 
frictionless
 
experience
 
which
 
we
 
can
 
give
 
to
 
them,
 
what
 
additional
 
benefits
 
they
 
will
 
get,
 
which
 
normally
 
they
 
won't
 
get
 
in
 
our
 
stores.
 
 So  those  are  all  the  learnings  which  we  have  to  get.  It  is  not  that  we  wanted  to  venture  in  and  
then
 
immediately
 
get
 
a
 
huge
 
volume.
 
You
 
know
 
us,
 
as
 
an
 
organization,
 
we
 
don't
 
do
 
like
 
that.
 
Even
 
in
 
the
 
international
 
market,
 
the
 
storyline
 
is
 
what,
 
the
 
storyline
 
is
 
we
 
go
 
to
 
the
 
country,
 
we
 
will
 
open
 
up
 
only
 
one
 
store
 
and
 
let
 
it
 
be
 
a
 
pull.
 
 Even  in  e-commerce  work,  it  is  only  like  that  that  we  have  to  learn.  It  is  a  pilot  for  us,  not  in  
any
 
tearing
 
rush
 
that
 
we
 
have
 
to
 
make
 
it
 
happen
 
always.
 
But
 
once
 
we
 
understand
 
what
 
it
 
is,
 
then
 
we
 
will
 
come
 
out
 
with
 
our
 
own
 
playbook.
 
 But  what  it  was  very  important  to  see  that  you  would  have  noticed  is  that  the  brand  page  of  
Royal
 
Enfield,
 
even
 
in
 
those
 
e-commerce
 
websites,
 
are
 
completely
 
managed
 
by
 
us
 
along
 
with
 
the
 
e-commerce
 
companies.
 
The
 
entire
 
brand
 
language,
 
the
 
way
 
it
 
has
 
to
 
be
 
presented,
 
the
 
way
 
no
 
discounts,
 
strike-throughs,
 
nothing
 
should
 
be
 
there
 
in
 
the
 
typical
 
way,
 
which
 
will
 
be
 
there
 
on
 
an
 
e-commerce
 
site.
 
 We  were  very,  very  particular  that  it  has  to  be  represented  in  a  particular  way.  And  that's  why  I  
said
 
it
 
is
 
a
 
pilot.
 
It's
 
not
 
in
 
a
 
tearing
 
rush.
 
The
 
pilot
 
is
 
showing
 
some
 
good
 
results.
 
We
 
are
 
Page  16  of  18   

 
Eicher
 
Motors
 
Limited
 
 
 
November  13,  2025   studying  a  bit  more.  We  are  analyzing  it  to  see  how  we  scale  it,  should  we  scale  it  and  where  
do
 
we
 
scale
 
it.
 
That's
 
the
 
discussion
 
which
 
is
 
ongoing
 
currently.
 
Yash  Agrawal:  Thank  you  sir.  The  second  question  is  for  VECV.  What's  the  product  road  map  in  CNG,  LNG  
and
 
electric
 
CVs?
 
And
 
how
 
do
 
you
 
expect
 
them
 
to
 
contribute
 
over
 
the
 
next
 
3
 
to
 
5
 
years?
 
Vinod  Aggarwal:  If  you  look  at  CNG,  we  are  already  one  of  the  market  leaders.  Our  CNG  trucks  and  buses,  both  
are
 
there
 
in
 
the
 
light
 
and
 
medium-duty
 
range.
 
As
 
far
 
as
 
electric
 
is
 
concerned,
 
we
 
have
 
now
 
2
 
to
 
3.5
 
tonne,
 
where
 
we
 
started
 
this
 
Pro
 
X
 
range
 
with
 
the
 
electric
 
trucks.
 
 And  we  also  have  some  units  sold  in  5.5  tonne,  but  there,  the  cost  of  ownership  basis,  viability  
is
 
a
 
bit
 
of
 
a
 
challenge.
 
And
 
then
 
of
 
course,
 
we
 
are
 
working
 
on
 
electric
 
models
 
for
 
the
 
tippers
 
and
 
for
 
the
 
tractor
 
trailers.
 
So
 
those
 
will
 
come
 
in
 
future.
 
 For  electric  buses,  we  are  there  in  9-meter  bus,  we  are  there  in  12-meter  bus  and  we  are  going  
to
 
participate
 
in
 
the
 
new
 
tender,
 
which
 
is
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
opening
 
shortly.
 
And
 
as
 
far
 
as
 
LNG
 
is
 
concerned,
 
we
 
are
 
already
 
there
 
in
 
LNG
 
trucks.
 
 We  have  sold,  I  think,  good  numbers  in  the  55  ton,  again,  tractor  trailer  segment.  So  we  are  
there
 
in
 
all
 
the
 
alternate
 
fuels.
 
And
 
of
 
course,
 
slowly
 
and
 
steadily,
 
these
 
alternate
 
fuels
 
will
 
become
 
more
 
popular,
 
especially
 
LNG
 
is
 
expected
 
to
 
become
 
more
 
popular.
 
 CNG  is  already  very  popular  for  the  metro  cities  and  distances  up  to  400,  500  kilometers.  Like  
for
 
example,
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
cities,
 
the
 
diesel
 
sales
 
are
 
not
 
allowed.
 
Therefore,
 
like
 
in
 
a
 
city
 
like
 
Delhi,
 
it's
 
only
 
CNG
 
which
 
sells.
 
So
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be,
 
I
 
think,
 
slow
 
and
 
steady
 
migration
 
to
 
the
 
better
 
fuels.
 
Yash  Agrawal:  And  what  are  the  key  hurdles  you  see  in  their  penetration  going  forward?  
Vinod  Aggarwal:  Key  hurdles  in  the  penetration?  
Yash  Agrawal:  Yes,  like...  
Vinod  Aggarwal:  For  the  long  haul  trucks,  the  key  hurdle  is  definitely  the  one  is  charging  infrastructure.  And  the  
other
 
is
 
in
 
the
 
long
 
haul
 
trucks,
 
when
 
you
 
put
 
more
 
weight
 
of
 
batteries,
 
the
 
payload
 
also
 
comes
 
down.
 
So
 
therefore,
 
in
 
long
 
haul,
 
the
 
popular
 
models
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
tipper
 
category
 
where
 
the
 
vehicles
 
operate
 
in
 
the
 
localized
 
environment
 
so
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
with
 
the
 
lesser
 
capacity
 
and
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
with
 
more
 
charging.
 
 And  then,  of  course,  the  tractor  trailers  from  the  port  to  warehouse  movement  where  the  
movement
 
is
 
only
 
200
 
kilometers.
 
So
 
those
 
are
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
routes
 
which
 
are
 
becoming
 
more
 
popular.
 
Otherwise,
 
the
 
smaller
 
trucks,
 
of
 
course,
 
will
 
be
 
more
 
popular.
 
But
 
there
 
again,
 
the
 
migration
 
has
 
been
 
very
 
slow.
 
 And  the  other  major  hurdle  comes  from  the  financier  side  because  financiers  are  also  still  not  
fully
 
open
 
to
 
finance
 
these
 
electric
 
trucks
 
or
 
electric
 
buses.
 
And
 
for
 
the
 
electric
 
buses,
 
of
 
course,
 
it
 
is
 
the
 
government
 
buying
 
largely.
 
There,
 
of
 
course,
 
the
 
government
 
has
 
now
 
given
 
Page  17  of  18   

 
Eicher

Limited
 
 
 
November  13,  2025   the  payment  security  mechanism  based  on  which  the  banks  and  financiers  are  giving  loans  to  
the
 
operators.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
things
 
are
 
evolving,
 
and
 
we
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
patient
 
in
 
this.
 
Yash  Agrawal:  Thank  you  sir,  that’s  very  helpful.  
Moderator:  Thank  you.  I  now  hand  the  conference  over  to  the  management  of  Eicher  Motors  Limited  for  
closing
 
comments.
 
Over

B.  Govindarajan:  Thank  you  very  much  everyone  for  attending  this  and  look  forward  to  having  a  chat  with  you  
soon.
 
See
 
you
 
all.
 
Cheers.
 
Vinod  Aggarwal:  Thank  you.  
Moderator:  Thank  you.  On  behalf  of  Eicher  Motors  Limited,  that  concludes  this  conference.  Thank  you  all  
for
 
joining
