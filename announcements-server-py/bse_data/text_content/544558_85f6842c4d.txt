Clarification on Corporate Identity  
Fabtech Technologies Limited & Fabtech Technologies Cleanrooms Limited are Separate Entities 
 
Mumbai, November 18, 2025 
It has come to our attention that there is a misconception among investors and the public that Fabtech Technologies 
Limited (FTL) and Fabtech Technologies Cleanrooms Limited (FTCL) are the same company. We wish to clarify that both 
are distinct, independently listed entities operating under separate management and business models.  
 
Fabtech Technologies Limited (FTL) – (Listed on Main Board – NSE & BSE | FABTECH | INE0HF201011) 
FTL is an international turnkey life sciences infrastructure company, delivering start -to-finish pharmaceutical and 
biotech manufacturing solutions across 62 countries. The company integrates design, engineering, process systems, and 
validation to build GM P-compliant, energy -efficient, and contamination -controlled facilities,  that support 
pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and healthcare facilities worldwide.  
Fabtech Technologies Cleanrooms Limited (FTCL) – (Listed on BSE SME | FABCLEAN | INE0HSD01011) 
FTCL is an India-focused cleanroom infrastructure company, offering in-house manufactured modular partitions, HVAC, 
and MEP systems for pharma, biotech, semiconductor, and green energy sectors. With FM Global-certified solutions, FTCL 
ensures safety, compliance, and innovation in controlled-environment engineering. 
While both share the Fabtech legacy, FTL and FTCL function as independent entities within their respective domains.
