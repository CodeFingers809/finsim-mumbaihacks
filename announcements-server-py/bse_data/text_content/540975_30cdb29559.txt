2 Aster DM Healthcare Limited – Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call  
 
 
 
Puneet Maheshwari: Good afternoon, everyone. I welcome you to Aster  DM Healthcare 
Earnings Conference call for the Q2 FY26. Today with us we have the senior 
management of Aster DM Healthcare, namely Ms. Alisha Moopen, Deputy 
Managing Director; Mr. T.J. Wilson, Non -Executive Director; Mr. Ramesh 
Kumar, Chief Operating Officer;  Mr. Sunil Kumar, Chief Financial Officer;  
and Mr. Hitesh Dhaddha, Chief Investor Relations and M&A O fficer. We 
are also delighted to have Mr. Varun Khanna, G roup MD of Quality Care. 
Mr. Khanna is here solely in the capacity of a representative of Quality 
Care, to give insights into the business and fu ture plans of Quality Care , 
the entity which is in process to get merged with Aster DM Healthcare. 
 It is to be noted that the merger is subject to further regulatory approvals. 
All external attendees will be in listen mode only for the duration of the 
entire call. We will start the call with the opening remarks by the 
management, followed by an interactive Q&A session. Certain forward -
looking statements in this meeting involve risk and uncertainties. 
 Aster DM Healthcare assumes no responsibility for actions based on these 
statements and undertakes no obligation to update the m for future 
events. With this, I will now request Ms. Alisha Mo open to start with the 
opening remarks. Over to you, Ms. Alisha. 
 
Alisha Moopen:                    Thank you, Puneet. Good afternoon , everyone, and thank you for joining 
us today. Let me begin with a brief look at the broader environment. The 
Indian economy continues to show remarkable resilience amid global 
uncertainties, underpinned by strong domestic demand and prudent fiscal 
management. Within this macro environment, the hospita l sector stands 
out as a key beneficiary. The Indian hospital services market is poised for 
healthy growth, driven by higher insurance penetr ation, expanding 
medical infrastructure, and growing demand for specialty and acute care 
services. The government’s recent GST rate reduction on select healthcare 
consumables and diagnostics is a constructive step towards making quality 
healthcare more affordable, while simultaneously improving cost 
efficiency for providers.  This environment creates strong tailwinds for 
organized private hospital networks such as Aster. With a well- balanced 
presence across Tier 1 metros and Tier 2 growth markets, we are uniquely 
positioned to serve both mature urban centers  — where demand is 
shifting towards high -acuity and complex care and emerging regional 
cities, which are witnessing faster volume growth and expanding 
catchment potential. This dual -market footprint provides stability, 
scalability, and a long runway for su stainable expansion.  Amid this 
backdrop, Q2 FY26 has been a period of meaningful progress for Aster, 
marked by steady financial performance, recovery in a key market i.e. 
Kerala, and continued advancement of our long -term strategic priorities. 
Taking a step back, our performance this quarter builds on a solid multi-
year trajectory. For the last  20 consecutive quarters, Aster has delivered 
year-on-year revenue growth —  a reflection of our strategic foresight, 
disciplined execution, and enduring resilience through varying market  
conditions. This consistent upward trend has translated into a 20% 
revenue CAGR and a 38% CAGR in Operating EBITDA over the past 5 years, 
demonstrating our ability to grow both scale and profitability in tandem.  
As we are making progress towards the completion of merger, both Aster 
and QCIL have demonstrated consistent and complementary growth 
across clusters, driven by efficient cost management, improved case mix, 

3 Aster DM Healthcare Limited – Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call  
and continued focus on clinical excellence. The combined platform, on a 
proforma basis, delivered a healthy performance this quarter, with 
proforma revenues organically growing 13% YoY to INR 2,390 Crore on 
back of 8% growth in total patient volumes and  10% growth in ARPP (IP), 
with operating EBITDA growing 17% to INR 550 Crore and Normalised PAT 
growing 22% to INR 258 Crore, translating into a robust 23% operating 
EBITDA margin and a ROCE exceeding 22%. This consistent strong 
performance reflects the under lying strength and scalability of the 
combined entity. As we move forward, our focus will be on unlocking the 
full synergy potential of this integration through clinical collaboration, 
shared technology platforms, optimised procurement, network 
rationalisation, and talent mobility. These efforts will further e nhance 
profitability and capital efficiency while enabling us to deliver consistent, 
high-quality, and affordable care at scale across India. 
 
Coming to the Kerala cluster which is really a story of recovery and 
momentum — The Kerala cluster’s journey over the past year has been 
one of transformation and resilience. After a phase of softness in Q3 and 
Q4 FY25 — resulting from leadership transitions, seasonal factors like 
Ramadan and a dip in international patient inflows — we entered FY26 
with a clear focus on rebuilding momentum. The team responded 
decisively, strengthening leadership, tightening operational processes, 
and re -engaging with key MV T partners and referral networks. These 
interventions began to bear fruit in Q1 FY26, with sequential growth in 
inpatient volumes in Q2 FY26 and confidence gradually returning across 
hospitals. The true inflection came in Q2 FY26, when Kerala delivered its 
highest-ever quarterly revenue of INR 620 Crore, growing 24% increase 
over INR 499 Crore in Q4 FY25. This was supported by a 13% sequential 
increase in inpatient volumes and a strong rebound in MVT, which grew 
67% QoQ and 49% YoY. Occupancy improved to 69% in Q2 FY26 from 64% 
last quarter, reflecting sustained recovery in electives and high -acuity 
admissions. ARPP (IP) grew 5% YoY, supported by a stronger specialty mix, 
increased share of complex procedures, and disciplined pricing. 
Profitability improved sharply, with Operating EBITDA margins expanding 
to 26.8% from 22.3% in Q4 FY25, supported by a stronger specialty mix as 
well as  cost discipline. Overall, Kerala has not only recovered from last 
year’s softness but has re-established itself as a key growth engine for the 
India business — combining scale, profitability, and operational excellence 
with renewed momentum.  
 
 Now coming to the consolidated performance for the quarter. In Q2 FY26, 
we continued to build on the strong foundation laid in the first quarter, 
reinforcing both growth and efficiency across our core performance 
metrics. Despite softer seasonal infections this year, the business delivered 
resilient growth across clusters and sustained improvement in profitability 
drivers.  
 Revenue grew by 10% YoY to INR 1,197 Crore. Adjusting for the temporary 
seasonal effect, our underlying revenue growth stood at a healthy mid -
teen i.e. 13% — demonstrating the strength of our underlying business 
momentum. 
 The ARPP IP increased by 10% YoY driven by a richer specialty mix with 
stronger contributions from Oncology and also the discontinuation of low-
yield schemes. 
 Our focus on complex, high-value care continued to deliver results — with 
Oncology revenue growing 26% YoY, and its share of total revenue rising 
to 11%, compared to 9% just a year ago. 
4 Aster DM Healthcare Limited – Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call  
 Given that we are in a phase of recovery post certain key leadership 
changes, it is important to also focus on the quarter-on-quarter changes in 
the performance for this quarter. On a sequential basis, total patient 
volume grew by 15% QoQ with Inpatient volume growing by 12% QoQ and 
Outpatient volume growing by 15% QoQ in Q2 FY26. Kerala’s total patient 
volume increased by 17% QoQ with Inpatient by 13% QoQ and Outpatient 
by 17% QoQ. Andhra & Telangana had 16% QoQ increase in both Inpatient 
and Outpatient volume. Occupancy grew to 64% in Q2 FY26 from 59% in 
Q1 FY26 with Kerala at 69% in Q2 vs. 64% in Q1 FY26 . K&M at 62% in Q2 
vs. 56% in Q1 FY26 and A&T at 55% in Q2 vs. 50% in Q1 FY26. 
 The MVT segment shown strong momentum, growing 60% QoQ and 26%  
YoY led by higher international patient footfall in Kerala with its MVT 
business growing by 67%, particularly from Maldives, Middle East and 
North African countries.  
 
 Now moving onto the bottom-line performance - Operating EBITDA 
margin expanded 200 basis points to 22% in Q2 FY26, compared with 20% 
in Q1 FY26, reflecting the combined impact of Kerala’s recovery, enhanced 
cost control, better specialty mix, clinical efficiency across the network and 
the steady improvement in the Labs and Pharmacy business. 
 Kerala Cluster Operating EBITDA grew 19% YoY with margins expanding to 
26.8% in Q2 from 25.3% in Q1 FY26. Andhra & Telangana Operating EBITDA 
nearly doubled QoQ with margins expanding significantly to 13.2% in Q2 
FY26 from 7.9% in Q1 FY26. Labs’ operating margins significantly improved 
to 17.8% in Q2 FY26 as compared to 7.6% in Q1 FY26. On a Normalised  
basis (i.e. excluding one -time merger related costs), PAT rose 23% 
sequentially to INR 110 Crore. 
 Collectively, these trends reflect the tangible impact of the strategic and 
operational measures implemented earlier in the year — reinforcing our 
focus on sustainable, high -quality growth while enhancing efficiency 
across the network. 
 Moving on to our capex - Our growth story isn’t just about performance — 
it’s also about preparing for the future. Over the past year, we have added 
more than 200 beds, bringing our total capacity to 5,199 beds as of 
September 30, 2025. 
 
 The Kerala cluster is also set for expanding its footprint in Q3 FY26 with 
the commissioning of our new 264 -bed hospital in Kasaragod on October 
2, 2025, taking our network to 20 hospitals across India, including over 
2,900 beds in Kerala. This addition enhances access to quality care in 
northern Kerala and reinforces our focus on deepening regional presence 
and patient reach. The hospital has made a promising start, with average 
daily OPD footfall exceeding 150 and a steady rise in inpatient admissions. 
We have also ensured a strong clinical backbone from day one with 50+ 
doctors are already onboard. 
 Apart from Kasargod, in the coming years, we plan to add another 2,300+ 
beds, through both greenfield and brownfield projects, taking our capacity 
beyond 7,800 beds. 
 
 During the quarter, we further strengthened our presence in Andhra 
Pradesh by acquiring an additional 13% stake in Aster Ramesh Hospitals 
bringing Aster’s stake to over 70%. This strategic move consolidates our 
regional network and deepens our footprint in Southern India. 
 Now moving over to the merger - A notable development in the quarter 
was the continued progress on our merger process with Quality Care India 
Limited. The merger has now received no -objection letters with no 
5 Aster DM Healthcare Limited – Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call  
adverse observations from both BSE and NSE, following earlier approvals. 
 
 Over the past few months, the transaction has advanced smoothly through 
key regulatory milestones. A quick snapshot of the progress on merger 
process includes: 
 Shareholders have approved the preferential share issuance.  The 
Competition Commission of India has granted its approval. 
 We completed a strategic share swap, acquiring a 5% stake in QCIL in 
exchange for a 3.6% preferential allotment in Aster. These shares are now 
listed on the stock exchanges.  Most recently, BSE and NSE ‘no -objection’ 
have further advanced the merger process, paving the way for the next 
phase of integration. 
 
 The Company will now approach the NCLT to initiate the final approval 
phase. Post-application, a shareholders’ meeting will be held to approve 
the merger, following which the NCLT’s sanction will make the merger 
effective, leading to the issuance of new sh ares. Upon completion, the 
merged platform will have 38 hospitals across 27 cities, with a combined 
capacity of over 10,360 beds, positioning us among the leading healthcare 
providers in the country. 
 
 Q2 FY26 has been a quarter of notable recognitions for both our leadership 
and institutions. Our Founder Chairman and Managing Director, Dr. Azad 
Moopen, was honoured across multiple national platforms — being 
named ‘Healthcare Icon of the Year’ at The Eco nomic Times Healthcare 
Awards 2025, ‘Legend in the Healthcare Industry’ at FICCI Heal 2025 and 
receiving the ‘Lifetime Achievement Award’ from Entrepreneur India, 
celebrating his visionary leadership and lifelong contribution to 
healthcare. He was also featured among ‘Forbes Middle East’s Top 5 
Healthcare Leaders 2025’ and recognised as one of ‘Forbes Middle East’s 
Sustainability Leaders 2025’, for championing Aster’s journey towards an 
equitable and sustainable healthcare future. 
 At the institutional level, many of our hospitals were recognized at ET 
Healthcare Awards 2025 for their leadership positioning across complex 
specialties and procedures. 
 
 Also, Aster Whitefield Hospital received the ‘Technology Transformation 
Initiative of the Year’ award at FICCI Heal 2025 for its pioneering Walk -in 
FAPI PET/CT Imaging Services, reaffirming our commitment to advancing 
patient outcomes through technology and innovation. 
 As we close the quarter, our performance underscores the strength of 
Aster’s diversified healthcare model and disciplined execution across 
markets. Despite softer seasonal trends, we delivered healthy growth 
across clusters and expanded margins through ope rational efficiency and 
a sharper focus on high-value care. 
 Our continued investments in capacity expansion, digital transformation, 
and clinical talent are building a future -ready platform designed for scale 
and sustainability. 
 The upcoming merger with QCIL will further reinforce this foundation, 
creating one of India’s most comprehensive and efficient healthcare 
networks. 
 This consistency, agility to bounce back, and strategic foresight reflect a 
resilient growth trajectory, marked by steady earnings expansion, 
improving returns, and long -term value creation. With strong 
fundamentals, an expanding footprint, and a clear pathway to integration 
and innovation, Aster is well positioned to deliver sustainable and 
6 Aster DM Healthcare Limited – Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call  
profitable growth in the quarters ahead. 
 Together, these developments mark an inflection point in Aster’s journey. 
We are poised to deepen clinical excellence and deliver greater value to 
patients, partners, and shareholders in the years ahead. 
 
 I now invite our COO, Mr. Ramesh Kumar, to take you through the detailed 
cluster-wise performance. 
Ramesh Kumar:  Thank you, Alisha, and good afternoon, everyone. 
 I’ll take a few minutes to share how each of our clusters performed during 
the quarter and how our operational and expansion priorities are shaping 
up. 
 This quarter’s results once again highlight the strength of our cluster 
model and disciplined execution across markets. 
 Let me begin with Kerala. The cluster delivered a solid year- on-year 
performance, with revenue increasing 11% YoY to INR 620 Crore. The 
improvement was driven primarily by a richer specialty mix, and an 5% YoY 
increase in ARPP ( IP), supported by higher contribution from complex 
procedures and MVT business growth. 
 With a lower incidence of seasonal illness this year, which kept absolute 
volume growth moderated, the cluster maintained strong throughput in 
elective and specialty -led admissions. Operating EBITDA increased 19% 
YoY to INR 166 Crore, with margins improving to 26.8% from 25.0% last 
year. The improvement in profitability was driven by disciplined cost 
control, stabilization of leadership team, and a more balanced payor and 
case mix. This reflects a meaningful recovery from the softness seen in the 
second half of FY25. 
 In Karnataka and Maharashtra, the cluster reported 10% YoY revenue 
growth, supported by continued ramp- up in Aster Whitefield and strong 
ARPP (IP) improvement led by high -value programs, including oncology, 
neurosciences, and other complex surgical care. However, it is important 
to note that the shift towards med ical oncology has also led to higher 
material cost, driven by Immunotherapy and targeted therapy services. As 
a result, Operating EBITDA grew 6% YoY during the quarter.  
 In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, revenue grew 8% YoY, supported by 4% 
growth in inpatient flow and 4% growth in ARPP (IP) driven by better case 
mix. Year -on-year Operating EBITDA growth also reflected higher 
replacement cost of clinical talent. However, quarter-on -quarter basis 
Operating EBITDA has almost doubled. These investments were necessary 
to enhance long-term clinical capability for the cluster. 
 In summary, this has been a strong quarter of execution and growth across 
clusters. Kerala delivered a record -high performance, Karnataka and 
Maharashtra maintained steady double -digit growth, and Andhra and 
Telangana continued its upward trajectory, despite the impact of lower 
seasonal incidence. With approximately 2,300 additional beds planned 
across these regions over the years, we are entering a phase of 
accelerated scale, deeper penetration, and stronger operating leverage. 
 Thank you. I’ll now hand it over to Sunil for a detailed review of the 
financial performance. 
Sunil Kumar:  Thank you, Mr. Ramesh. Good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to share 
Aster DM Healthcare’s financial performance for Q2 FY26:  
7 Aster DM Healthcare Limited – Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call  
For the quarter ended 30th Sep 25, revenues have increased to INR 1,197 
Cr, up by 10% from INR  1,086 Cr in Q2 FY25 and Operating EBIT DA has 
increased to INR 263 Cr with a margin of 22.0% compared to INR 233 Cr in 
Q2 FY25 with a growth of 13%. Normalised PAT (Post NCI) for Q2 FY26 is 
at INR 110 Cr compared to INR 97 Cr in Q2 FY25 with growth of 14 % YoY. 
For the half year ended 30th September 2025, India revenues have 
increased to INR 2,275 Cr, up by 9% from INR  2,088 Cr in H1 FY25 and 
Operating EBITDA has increased to  INR 478 Cr with the margin of 21.0% 
compared to INR 410 Cr in H1 FY25 with a growth of 17%. PAT (Post NCI) 
for H1 FY26 is at INR  200 Cr compared to INR  171 Cr in H1 FY25 with 
growth of 17 % YoY.  
Despite lower incidence of vector -borne diseases - which typically carry 
higher margins - I’m pleased to share that our Operating EBITDA improved 
by 13% YoY . It’s important to note that Q2 FY25 had an unusually high 
base, driven by elevated seasonal medical admissions. In contrast, Q2 
FY26 saw a softer medical case mix. Yet, even against this backdrop, we 
achieved an EBITDA margin improvement of 53 basis points.  
This margin expansion was driven by multiple strategic levers.  
In line with our focus on driving sustainable profitability, we have 
continued to execute on our cost optimization and operational 
efficiencies. During the quarter, we made meaningful progress through 
initiatives such as centralized procurement of services and non- medical 
consumables, as well as the adoption of renewable energy across our 
hospitals. These actions, supported by the benefits of operating leverage, 
delivered nearly a 100 basis-point reduction in overhead costs.  
Our renewable energy program is already delivering tangible results - we 
have commissioned 13 MW of projects across 3 hospitals in Kerala and 
Karnataka, with visible savings flowing through to our overhead costs. We 
are on track to go live with an additional 21 MW across 7 more hospitals 
during the second half of this year and early next year.  
We also achieved ~30 basis point efficiencies in manpower cost. These 
gains were partially offset by an ~80 basis point increase in material costs, 
primarily due to the strong growth in CONGO specialties - particularly 
Oncology, which grew by 26% YoY - and the lower incidence of vector -
borne diseases.  
Turning to our diagnostics business, I am pleased to share that Aster Labs 
has successfully delivered a turnaround since the start of FY25. EBITDA 
margins have expanded sharply from 11.0% in Q2 FY25 to 17.8% in Q2 
FY26, driven by a robust 31% YoY growth in external business, enhanced 
operating leverage, and improved material cost efficiencies. This 
turnaround has translated into a healthy ROCE of 23%, a remarkable 
recovery from the negative levels a year ago.  
As of H1 FY26, our total capital expenditure stood at INR 302 Cr, with 
nearly 50% allocated towards expansion projects. We continue to 
maintain a robust liquidity position, with cash and cash equivalents of INR 
1,276 Cr, while our gross debt remains moderate at INR 639 Cr. 
Additionally, we have seen a significant improvement in ROCE, which has 
increased by over 290 basis points - from 18.0% to 20.9%.  
With this, we have laid a solid foundation for future growth. As we move 
into future, we are confident of building on this momentum with the same 
discipline and focus.  
8 Aster DM Healthcare Limited – Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call  
On that note, I conclude my remarks.   
Now, I request Mr. Varun Khanna to take you through performance of 
Quality Care India Limited.   
Varun Khanna: Thank you, Sunil. Good afternoon and Thank You for joining us today. This 
quarter reaffirmed our unwavering commitment to our patients and 
excellence in care. Our focus on the fundamentals has enabled us to 
deliver strong clinical & financial outcomes in Q2, demonstrating our 
resilience and reduced dependence on seasonality. 
 During the quarter, we witnessed several of our key initiatives not only 
delivering strong outcomes but also becoming institutionalized within our 
operations. These initiatives are now gearing up for scale, reflecting the 
strength of our strategic direction and execution capabilities. This 
progress gives us added confidence in sustaining growth and driving long 
term value creation as we look ahead to the upcoming quarters. 
 Overall performance in Q2 has been strong, with revenue growing by 
15.1% YoY to INR 1,193 Crore, while post-Ind AS EBITDA rose by 21.6% YoY 
to INR 287 Crore. The EBITDA margin (post-Ind AS) improved by 130 basis 
points YoY to reach 24.1% in Q2 FY26. 
 This strong revenue performance was primarily driven by growth in ARPP 
and volume expansion. ARPP grew by 10% YoY to approximately INR 125k 
in Q2 FY26 (from INR 161k in Q2 FY25), supported by an improved 
specialty mix — with CONGO -T share increasing by 80 b asis p oints to 
58.5% — and a favorable  shift in payor mix, as the share of cash and 
insurance business rose by 240 basis points to 81%. 
 The EBITDA growth further reflects the early success of key synergy 
initiatives across procurement centraliz ation and F&B in- sourcing 
implemented in H2 FY25. Our efforts on clinical talent 
recruitment/management, and the strong ramp of the Nagercoil unit 
launched In Oct  2024, also contributed meaningfully to our EBITDA 
growth. 
 Our mature units (accounting for ~60% of revenue) delivered a 14.4% YoY 
revenue growth and 27.4% YoY EBITDA growth, achieving a 33.2% margin. 
Meanwhile, our emerging units which is ~6% of revenue continued to 
scale effectively, reporting 16.3% QoQ revenue growth and 90.1% QoQ 
EBITDA growth. 
 Our focus units which is ~29% of revenue also recorded a robust 30.4% 
QoQ EBITDA growth, reflecting our continued emphasis on operational 
excellence and disciplined execution across all facets of the business. 
 Another important aspect is leadership. We continue to attract 
exceptional talent from across the healthcare industry. Dr. Pawan Kumar 
recently joined our leadership team as CEO of CARE Hospitals. A graduate 
of JIPMER and PGIMER (Chandigarh) with an MBA from ISB, Dr. Pawan 
brings extensive leadership experience from his previous roles at Max, 
Cloudnine, and LIVASA Hospitals. 
 With this, we have onboarded over 10 – CXO level leaders to our team 
over the last few months, each bringing unique and complementary 
expertise, enabling us as we drive our next phase of growth and excellence 
in care.  
 We have been continuously advancing our doctor hiring models in a 
9 Aster DM Healthcare Limited – Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call  
structured manner and have onboard over 100 clinicians across the 
network during the quarter. While these initiatives were launched a few 
quarters ago, this quarter has shown significant progress — with the 
Monthly Recurring Revenue Run Rate (MRR) from the newly hired cohort 
of clinicians reaching INR 20 Crore. 
 Moreover, these new hires have been instrumental in driving a shift 
toward higher-acuity care, with our CONGO-T share increasing by 80 basis 
points to 58.5%, further reinforcing our commitment to clinical excellence 
and superior patient outcomes. 
 Our drive to advance clinical excellence has led to several milestones: the 
first robotic-assisted CABG in Andhra Pradesh, the first TAVI with real-time 
CT integration at KIMS, the first buccal cell culture urethral re -
implantation in Central India, and an  awake, beating -heart CABG on a 
high-risk 71-year-old patient with triple vessel disease and chronic total 
occlusions. We continue to place unwavering focus on improve our ability 
to manage clinical complexity so we can create the best outcomes for our 
patients. 
Our continued focus on clinical protocols has also enabled us to reduce 
our ALOS by 6% YoY, decreasing from 4.08 to 3.85 days. 
 With the launch of new clinical programs, we have also invested in 
advanced technologies, including one LINAC to support the Oncology 
ramp-up in Nagercoil, as well as the commissioning of 2 Cath labs, 2 OCT 
units (in Bhubaneswar and Trivandrum), and 2 MRI units to enhance our 
presence in key micro -markets. Additionally, we continue to strengthen 
our Robotics Program with the installation of a new robot in Hyderabad. 
 Expansion continues to be a key strategic priority. We remain committed 
to strengthening our presence in existing markets and entering new ones 
through greenfield developments, brownfield expansions, and strategic 
M&A. Our enhanced near - to medium -term gro wth plan includes an 
investment of around INR 2,000 Crore to add over 1,700 beds in the next 
3-4 years. In line with our mission to improve accessibility to high quality 
care, ~1,300 of the 1,700+ beds will be added in non -Metro / Tier-2 
markets. 
We also remain steadfast in our focus on improving access to state-of-the-
art clinical infrastructure, this is reinforced by our investments in setting 
up 5-7 LINAC systems across Tier -2 markets, strengthening our oncology 
capabilities in these regions. To enhance outcomes and support ALOS 
reduction, we are also expanding our robotic programs. 
 In the last quarter, we had rolled out a series of operational initiatives 
driving growth — including the first phase of call centre modernization in 
partnership with Tech Mahindra, and the beta launch of a CRM -based 
patient enrolment system to enhance engagement and service efficiency. 
I’m actually very pleased to share that we are already 100% on track to 
achieve this target, ensuring the project’s trajectory is well-positioned for 
scale. For the group, we plan to extend this initiative to the entire KIM S 
network in the coming quarter. 
 While we continue to receive numerous accolades across our hospital 
network, a few highlight the strength of our unified platform and brand:  
Quality CARE India Limited received the ‘Visionary Healthcare Leadership 
Award’ from the Hon’ble Governor of Telangana at the AHPI Annual 
Conference. India Health Summit & Awards recognized us as the ‘Best 
10 Aster DM Healthcare Limited – Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call  
Hospital Network’ by the TIMES Group. KIMS Health, Trivandrum earned 
‘Platinum Green OT Certification’ for all operation theatres, meeting 
global standards in energy efficiency, patient safety, and sustainability . 
Thank you so much for joining us this afternoon.

out your name after which your line will be un-muted, and you will be able 
to ask your questions. I would also like to request to all the participants, if 
you can introduce yourself with your name and the company that you are 
associated with before asking the question.  
If you are not associated with any company, if you are an individual 
investor, you can highlight that as well.  
Moving on to the Q&A session, the first question is from Mr. Tausif.  
 
Tausif Shaikh:  This is Tausif from BNP Paribas.  Thanks for the opportunity and congrats 
on a good set of numbers.  My first question is to Ramesh.  
 Can you give us some qualitative update on the Kerala business, especially 
when Aster DM has focused at last 1 year in the clinical program and also 
this quarter where the growth which you have seen in Kerala business, 
whether it pertains to your flagship hospital Medcity or the growth was a 
broad based? 
 
Ramesh Kumar:  Thank you, Ta usif, for that very good question. I mean, in fact, this, as I 
mentioned about the Kerala has been performing very well.  And in fact, it 
is not only Medcity alone, but also across the board. Just to give a highlight, 
I’ll throw some highlights, as far as the overall business has been very good, 
as far as the case mix is concerned, you'll find that it is all high -end and 
CONGO-T mix is really doing very well.  And you see the M VT business 
grown by 49%. So, we have all high-end procedures happening, especially 
in Medcity, you will find that robotic procedures, which has been doing 
exceedingly well, and in fact, some months we have crossed even 80 
numbers per month. So that is a kind of high-end procedures what we have 
started doing. Oncology has been doing exceedingly well across the board, 
and especially in Medcity. The leadership you'll see whom we have hired, 
especially in M VT, and the unit -wise leadership is stabilized, you'll find 
efficiency is settled , especially when it comes to manpower optimi zation 
or cost optimization as far as the material consumption is concerned. I 
think overall Kerala has been steadily doing exceedingly  well. And it will 
continue to do well. Unlike FY25, we had some vector-borne disease at that 
time. The volumes were very high as far as pulmonology, internal medicine, 
and pediatric is concerned. But Q2 FY26, you'll find that quality electives, 
surgical numbers have really gone up.  So, that's where the specialty mix 
have changed and the performance is really good. 
 
Tausif Shaikh:  Ramesh, anything on the MVT patient footfall means the growth of 26% 
which you have seen YoY.  
 
Ramesh Kumar:  Yeah.  So, especially there are 2, as we said, Middle East, especially from 
Oman, we had a significant growth. So , that is one area. Maldives, have 
also refocused on Maldives, have brought in a lot of attraction of patients. 
So overall, we have a pan India, we have taken a leadership for MVT now, 
more focus on each of these cluster wise focus has been happening.  So 
thereby, even African countries have been one of the good number of 
11 Aster DM Healthcare Limited – Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call  
patients have been coming from the African belt as well. So, overall MVT 
business, you'll find a good growth of 23% across the board across India. 
 
Tausif Shaikh:  Thanks Ramesh. My second question is to Varun. Just wanted to 
understand your expansion plan beyond FY28 for the merged entity. 
Whether you plan to pursue aggressive M&A in areas like Western India 
and Northern India, where we don't have much presence?  
 
Varun Khanna:  Tausif, good afternoon and thanks for the question. Tausif, I just reiterated 
that we are very clear in terms of brownfield and greenfield expansion. I 
think that's been laid out very clearly. Strategic M&A, you know, you can't 
really make plans, but we'll always be open for it. 
 
Tausif Shaikh:  Thanks. I think I'll get back in the queue. 
 
Puneet Maheshwari:  Thank you, Tausif. The next question is coming from Mr. Am ey. Can you 
please unmute your line and ask the question? 
 
Amey Chalke:  Thank you for giving opportunity and congrats on good set of numbers.  
So, first question I have on the Karnataka and Maharashtra cluster, which 
is showing around 10% growth. I believe the Whitefield you have written 
in the PPT that is doing well, delivering 25% + growth during the quarter. 
So, which is the hospital which is overall affecting the performance here 
and the reason for the same? 
 
Alisha Moopen: Thank you for the question, Amey. So, I think the main unit which is giving 
us the growth in Karnataka right now is still Whitefield, because it's 
obviously a newer unit. So, when you look at the growth on Whitefield, 
there's a significant, I think it's almost 27% growth that we're seeing.  
Ramesh, do you want to expand more on. 
 
Ramesh Kumar: Yeah, rightly said. So, there is a good growth as far as Whitefield is 
concerned with 27% growth happening there, especially oncology has 
grown very well.  The contribution from oncology is almost 17% towards 
the total revenue of Karnataka. So, you find that overall performance has 
done very good as far as Whitefield and Aster RV is concerned. Aster CMI, 
it's slightly we are having a single digit growth, but definitely it  is also 
growing as for the market, the traction has been very good in and around 
north part of Bangalore. So , we can see a better growth, definitely there 
should be a better growth with the Aster CMI as well.  But if you compare 
it to FY25, again, I did mention about the vector -borne disease, we had a 
higher volume there in last year, FY25 second quarter. 
 So that is a reason, and you will find a moderate growth happening this 
year over FY25, in FY26.   
 
Sunil Kumar: Just to add to that, to give you a number so that can be sort, basically you 
club in seasonal impact. Overall, India, the internal medicine, Pulmonology 
and Pediatrician, right, so there we have got a 12% de-growth across India 
and Kerala impact is little lower than compared to Karnataka.  Kerala 
impact is only 6% but Karnataka very specifically the Bangalore impact is 
almost 26% right so that's a huge impact that's where on the year-on-year 
we used to go to the mid -teens or higher te en growth that is not visible 
because of that just giving the numbers on that.  
 
Amey Chalke: Got it, got it. Thank you so much. And the second question I have is on the 
FY27 guidance on the expansion side. We have 3 greenfield units coming 
12 Aster DM Healthcare Limited – Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call  
up. Obviously, on a long-term basis, it's quite positive, but specifically for 
FY27 modeling on the margin side, what EBITDA impact should we take 
into account? And is there a possibility of QCIL brownfield expansion 
helping these margins to have a lower impact? If you can give some clarity 
on FY27. 
 
Sunil Kumar: So, yeah, if I can take up this question, Amey , see, I think we have, we're 
not giving a guidance just for 1 year, right. So, I think even in the last call, 
or even the previous meetings, we have always told that, as a combined 
entity, we are now at 23 % for the quarter , on a YTD basis  we are 
somewhere around 21 .5%, and going post -merger, right. So , we are 
looking at in 2-3 years to be near 24 -25%. Now, very specifically with 
respect to the greenfield, you see that both the greenfield,  the major  
greenfield, Hyderabad is anyway one which is coming, which is more of 
women and children.  But the important one is our Sarjapur, which is 
coming quite in the end of the year, because the brownfield just 
commenced the work there. So, it'll take at least somewhere in the end of 
the H2. And the capital should come around middle of the year. That's 
what we put across as H2 FY27. And we've seen that wherever we have a 
strong cluster, we tend to do well. So , we expect not to have a too much 
drag on the EBITDA margin. And it's very, very important by then, I think, 
with merger on the way, we should also have synergies also coming into 
the picture.  That should also help in a very big way in addressing any 
losses, initial losses there. 
 
Amey Chalke: Sure. So, should we assume that combined entity margin should be well 
maintained with accounting for the synergies during that year? 
 
Sunil Kumar: Yeah, as I said, I don't want to give a guidance exactly on the particular 
year. 
 
Alisha Moopen: I think Amey, maybe we haven't, we might not be able to say exactly how 
much the margin will be maintained or if there's any dilution, but I think 
what's really helpful to note is how complimentary this is, right? The 
Trivandrum asset, which is coming 500 beds, it's almost going to be now 
with the presence that KIMS has in Trivandrum. It's going to really help us 
kind of expand that capacity and create that cluster in Trivandrum.  Again, 
building on the leadership that KIMS has, building on the brand that Aster 
has.  I think that's a powerful story for us to kind of double down on. And 
even in Hyderabad, now with Women & Child, again, with the network 
that CARE has in Hyderabad, once the merger is complete, you will be able 
to see that network effect coming through.  So, we do see that both  of 
these are positives from a merger standpoint.  So, to the point you're 
making, we see this shift should help  us accelerate the performance of 
both these units on account of the merger as well.   
  
Amey Chalke: Sure. Thank you so much. I just have last question to Varun  ji. He 
mentioned that there is a 700-bed expansion for the QCIL asset. 300 beds 
are in Tier 2.  So just wanted to understand the thought process here when 
we have to choose the expansion between metros and Tier 2 , What is 
generally the thought process?  Because I believe the metros typically, 
although it has competition, it has quicker turnaround timelines as well as 
higher EBITDA per bed.  But Tier 2 typically have a longer timelines as well 
as lower EBITDA per bed. So , ROCE might be better, but it takes ti me for 
you to achieve those ROC E. How should we one think about it when it 
comes to expansion?  How should we balance it going ahead?  What's our 
13 Aster DM Healthcare Limited – Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call  
thought process there? 
 
Varun Khanna: Thanks for the question again. I think there are 2, 3 ways to see this.  One, 
the numbers are 1,700, 1,300. So, we're looking at those many beds  add 
over the next 3-4 years. I think on the point that Tier 2 markets take longer, 
I want to quote an example. We opened Nagercoil,  our hospital in Tamil 
Nadu in October 2024.  We were profitable from an EBITDA standpoint in 
the 3rd month. And I think, 1 year into the hospital, our current margins 
are in excess of 20%.  So, Tier 2 markets, if done right, the opportunity to 
scale them up fast is, in my opinion, better than many Tier 1 markets. But 
again, it depends on how you roll out a hospital. If you are able to bring 
the clinical team, the infrastructure, open it right, and the market is 
something that knows the brand, like Alisha mentioned on Trivandrum, 
the scale-up will be significantly faster. So, that's one way to look at it. 
When it comes to expansion also, I think one of the good things about 
expansion is that we are expanding where we are already present.  If you 
see, we are adding Indore, we are adding beds in Bhubaneswar, which is 
where we are constrained for capacity.  So, any bed addition will get 
occupied sooner than later. Then we are adding O ncology capabilities 
across Raipur, in Indore, in Bhubaneswar.  And I just told you about 
Nagercoil. So, we had initially planned that we will expand beds in 
Nagercoil probably in FY28, but the way we've grown in Nagercoil, the 
sense is that we will be adding beds in FY27. So, I think all of that will play 
well for our expansion as well as margin story. 
 
Amey Chalke: Sure, Thank you so much. I will join back. 
 
Puneet Maheshwari: Thanks, Amey. The next question is from Mr. Harith. 
 
Harith Ahmad: Hi, I hope I'm audible. So firstly, on QCIL, the margin profile that we're at 
currently around 20 -23%, if I look at on H1  basis. So, Varun if you could 
talk about some of the additional levers that we have to take this further 
up keeping the synergies aside. And what were the levels before you took 
over at the beginning of FY25 or towards the end of F Y24, what was the 
margin level that we were operating at on a pro -forma basis for all the 3 
platforms within QCIL put together? 
 
Varun Khanna: Margin has been a good story, Harith. We've done a lot of work on this. I 
just announced that we were at 24.1 % for the last quarter. At some point 
in time, we had given that as guidance as well a few quarters back.  So, 
what's impacting? I told you that we have a synergy wheel. Of course, we 
don't talk about the entire wheel, but there are 10 initiatives that we focus 
on. And I can't put synergy outside because this is a constant endeavor 
that will continue to happen.  Synergy is generally not when you only 
merge companies, it is a synergy that you continue to play from one 
hospital to the other. But from a margin expansion standpoint, there are 
3-4 things that have really helped us. One is the procurement side of it.  
We've been able to create efficiency and that efficiency is outside of what 
the planned efficiencies are post the merger as well. We've also done 
things that, KIMS as a network had F&B insourced. And we knew that that 
was the right thing to do because there are 2 elements around it. Patient 
complaints around food in Indian healthcare sector are number one. And 
if you're able to enhance that quality, it all goes very well for the patient 
experience. And it also does good to the P&L. So that's another piece that 
we've rolled out in QCIL across the network. So, we've started to insource 
F&B. Outside of that, there are multiple things. We are working on Capex 
14 Aster DM Healthcare Limited – Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call  
procurement, on enhancing, working on group strength, on the AMCs, etc.  
One of the other things the second part outside of procurement and the 
synergy wheel is really the payor mix. That is one thing that is, I mentioned 
in my commentary as well, it's easier said than done. But the fact that 
we've been able to move the payor mix by 280 basis points is phenomenal. 
I think there is business focus and operating focus, and when you do things 
right, you're able to grow the right payor  pretty well. So , our cash and 
insurance payor is doing extremely well, which is a very healthy sign for 
the business from a long- term standpoint as well. And needless to say, 
that is margin accretive. And we are today at about 81%.  Do I see this 
continue to grow?  Absolutely. I think the 3rd part is that we've always 
broken our business into the 4 categories that we spoke about, and we've 
been very focused on that. We know that there is a mature part of our 
network, which is about 60% of our business. There, what we try and do 
is we try and enhance the performance metrics there. So, there should be 
growth, and that part of our network is growing about 15% currently from 
a top standpoint, with a very significant EBITDA upside . We've started to 
see turnaround in most of our focus units as well.  And that's a large 
component, 25 -27% of our business comes in from there. We've seen 
significant upside there. So, our Hyderabad assets are now performing 
much better. And then matured units, which are underperforming, start 
to do better. The translation to EBITDA is quite significant. So, I think all of 
that is giving us the traction and will continue to in the foreseeable future.  
Also, the fact that we've been able to launch our new hospitals well and 
we're able to get to 25% profitability in the  third or fourth  quarter, the 
question that was asked to Sunil earlier, I think we know how to scale up 
fast. And that will keep us in good st rand, even when we add capacity 
going forward. 
 
Harith Ahmad: Got it. By keeping synergies aside, I meant the synergies with Aster.  That's 
very helpful  Varun. Yeah.  On Aster standalone, Sunil, I understand this 
question has come up in the previous quarters, but looking at the ARPOB 
growth, it's quite strong. And when I think of F Y27, some of the drivers 
like, you know, the Whitefield ramp up or the ALOS  reduction, the payor 
mix optimisation, these might not be as relevant or significant as we have 
seen in FY26. So, you know, is there guidance or some in dication 
directionally that you can give for FY27 for our ARPOB growth? 
 
Sunil Kumar: Thanks, Harit h. See,  if you know, I've always never given a 1 year or 1 
quarter growth, I always given on next 2-3 years where it could be. And 
also we want to see ARP OB also is very camouflaged with a lot of things, 
you know, making that particular KPI move, right, for example, our A LOS 
is being efficient I think this is our 3rd quarter where from 3.2-3.3 we have 
come down to 3.1 right so even in the 5%  ALOS reduction and that 5%  
directly moves to the ARPOB.  So, I think we should start moving out of 
ARPOB and move to the more of a ARPP (IP) also right ARPP for IP patients 
there also we've seen a movement even in the current, I would say quarter 
or the first H 1 also there are important things , one is that specifically in 
Karnataka & Maharashtra cluster scheme is very important wherein our 
Aadhar, Kolhapur is there.  We stopped the scheme because we already 
reached around 75% occupancy. We didn't have the space to occupy for 
our cash and TPA patients, right. So , on their 1,500 patients, for the 
quarter or 1,600 patients for the quarter was the reduction. And that has 
really moved the ARPP up. Second, Whitefield, see Whitefield just a 2nd 
year. Oncology is still driving the growth. Neuro is doing really,  well. 
Cardiac is doing well there. So that is also driving the, ARPOB . And, 
15 Aster DM Healthcare Limited – Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call  
specifically because Oncology is driving, our 60% of our Oncology comes 
from MedOnc.  And today in MedOnc, 40%-50% of that revenue is derived 
by Immunotherapy and targeted therapies. And their material cost is quite 
high, and also ticket sizes are high. And that's where you're seeing that 
year ARPP (IP). Second, I would say third-fourth item is the season. I think 
I called it in another question, that even though overall season impact for 
specifically these 3 specialties is 12% degrowth, what you're seeing. In 
Karnataka, the impact is quite high year- on-year. It's 26%. We had too 
much on the last year, and that's where the whole growth has come, only 
from CONGO-T specialties. That is one of the reasons why it looks very, 
very high. So, I think these are the factors, which are Whitefield anyway, 
once it gets Normalised  in just 1 more year. So other things, yeah, you'll 
always have. But my future thing will be is that look at A RPP (IP) growth 
somewhere between 7%-8% from a long-term point of view, like 2-3 years. 
 
Harith Ahmad: Thanks, Sunil. I'll get back in queue. 
 
Puneet Maheshwari: Thank you, Harith. I would request you to please raise your hand for any 
queries. The next question is from Mr. Bino. Mr. Bino, can you please ask 
your question? 
 
Bino Pathiparampil: Good afternoon, all of you, and congratulations on a great set of numbers 
and the recovery in Kerala cluster. Just 1 question remaining was around 
GST, i n your opening remarks, you mentioned that the production GST 
augurs well for the cost of service. Have you tried to quantify the benefit 
to margins that this can accrue? 
 
Sunil Kumar: Bino, thanks for the question. If I'm trying to get that question right we are 
talking about the GST impact. See, GST impact there's no impact in the OP 
services because we always choose to take the input and pay output to 
the department. So there's no impact on whether it's on the top line or in 
the cost from the OP. Only in case of IP very specifically open cases where 
you have also seen the benefit also because with the MRP going down 
there GST is coming down in the both in sales and the cost , so the both-
way impact is there. From Aster's point of view, the top -line impact, 
overall top-line impact on a monthly basis is around 1.1%.  And out of that, 
35-40 basis points impacts our EBITDA. But at the same time, it's very 
important to know that recently, I think sometime in October, we’ve also 
seen the CGHS price increase after more than a decade, more than 2,000 
procedures pricing has happened. And there we usually do ESI, ECHS, 
where they follow the CGHS rates and other PSU corporates what we do. 
We do approximately  INR 20 Crores of revenue every month.  There we 
see a positive INR 2 Crore impact in the revenue. And EBITDA out of that 
impact in the incremen tal revenue, around 75% -80% should flow to 
EBITDA. So, with that, whatever the negative impact what we're seeing in 
the GST should get compensated by the CGHS EBITDA increase.  
 
Bino Pathiparampil: Sorry, just a clarification. So why would there be a negative impact from 
the GST? I would assume that your cost will come down, and it will 
positively benefit the EBITDA.  
 
Sunil Kumar: So Bino, I can always share the mathematics later. But what also happens 
is that if I want to give an example, say , specifically in the open billing, 
what is happening is that on the MRP is what we used to sell, right. So, the 
MRP, for example, all the medicines used to be approximate 12%, now it 
has come down to 5%. Right, so what is the on the MRP, the GST has come 
16 Aster DM Healthcare Limited – Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call  
down by 12%.  And we used to have a margin of approximately 50% in the 
medicines specifically. So there, it has come down by 50%.  You got my 
point, right. So, whatever the revenue or loss what we are seeing on the 
MRP, only the 50% has come down. So, balance 50% is the one who's going 
to hit your P&L. It's very natural. And, also if you want, we can offline give 
you the mathematics to explain to you how it's impacting our data. 
 
Bino Pathiparampil: Understood, understood.  Thank you, that's fine. And one question about 
what is the thought behind shifting of the headquarters from Bangalore 
to Hyderabad?  
 
Hitesh Dhaddha: So, thanks Bino, for the question. As part of the merger, we just felt it's 
better to have the NCLT application for approval going from one state so 
that the process timelines can be better. And that was the key reason why 
we just thought that then because the head offices currently are in two 
different states. We just felt it's better to have happening. So that's why 
process will be more efficient. That was the reason why we did this. 
 
Bino Pathiparampil: Understood. Thank you. 
 
Puneet Maheshwari: Thanks, Bino. We request you to please limit your question to two but not 
more than three at a time.  Moving on to the next. The next question is 
from Damayanti. Damayanti, can you please ask your question? 
 
Damayanti Kerai: Yeah, hi, thank you for the opportunity. Most of the questions have been 
answered. I have 2 questions. First, now you have majority stake in D r. 
Ramesh hospital. So, with that, is there any change in the broader strategy 
for the Andhra and Telangana cluster? Because although it's a small 
cluster, but it's one of the least profitable in your network.  So, any 
comment will be helpful.   
 
Alisha Moopen: Hi, Damayan ti. So , we are working with Dr. Ramesh to kind of build a 
strategy for Andhra. I think probably a bit too early to say it, but we are 
doing some of the market studies on the potential.  So, there are a few 
proposals under review. So, we will see how, I mean, there is potential for 
the cluster. It's all about prioritizing where we want to put the capital, 
right?  So, we will come back.  Maybe in the next couple of quarters to you 
on that.   
 
Damayanti Kerai:  Sure, but it's I think it’s logical to assume that the margin profile could 
significantly improve from here because like other two clusters. It's in low 
double digit so maybe like there is more room to improve on this cluster.  
 
Alisha Moopen: So, I think we've seen some growth recently, there has been investments 
made in the doctors as well.  Of course, there is potential, we're trying to 
see there's also a lot of competition that's come in the market. So, we are 
making sure that  we keep improving in each of the clusters as much as 
possible. So yeah, so let us come back to you. I think we are seeing 
improvements in the cluster anyways, I think over the last year. 
 
Damayanti Kerai: Sure. My second question is, how  do you see your medium -term EBITDA 
margin in view of you know very strong performance in your core clusters 
like Kerala and then having a great visibility on drivers like O ncology etc.  
So where do you see your margins say in next 3-5 years from now? 
 
Sunil Kumar: So, again, we would like to resist on the cluster wise EBITDA margins, but 
17 Aster DM Healthcare Limited – Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call  
we already given a broad guidance on a merged entity post-merger, we're 
looking at 24 -25%, but still, you understand that margins are indirectly 
linked to the ARPP , for the IP patients, right? So , the higher the ARPP, 
because the material cost is going where we get the leverage. But at the 
same time, you've seen the Kerala cluster has done really well because of 
the capacity, which we added almost a brown field expansions happened 
both in Aster Medcity and in Kannur. And we've seen that Kannur, which 
used to be in high  teens, has gone beyond 20% of the margins.  And our 
Medcity, where it was around 750 beds, we added another 100 beds.  
There, the margins have gone beyond 30%. And also it's a very big hospital, 
we're inching towards more than INR 90-100 Crores of revenue per 
month. With all this, I think it's all about the brownfield expansion and 
how we can bring the efficiency. But as I said, yes, I understand where 
we're coming from. With the Oncology happening, yes, with the material 
cost being higher, there could be some stress. But also, we're looking at 
not specifically trying to grow only one specialty. We are also interested 
to grow across the C ONGO-T specialties. So, with that, I think we will be 
able to manage the EBITDA margins better.   
 
Damayanti Kerai: Yeah, actually, I was wondering like if it could be higher because Oncology 
although there is high material cost but the realisation,  I understand it is 
better than many specialties. So, I was just thinking like more than 24-25% 
if you can achieve. 
 
Alisha Moopen: We give this statement, right?  Like even if you look at just the last quarter 
with the GST change, with the CGHS price change, so many things keep 
happening in the sector, right? And rightfully so, I think our commitment 
is to always kind of like what Varun was saying earlier, looking at each 
lever constantly, dynamically, seeing what can be optimised, what are the 
options that we have. And of course, even with the merger, there'd be a 
lot of synergies that comes in.  But we maintain this balance of which 
clinical programs to run, what makes sense for the different clusters for 
each unit, detailing out what clinical programs to kind of focus on, and 
then also making sure at the same time, we are able to improve the 
efficiency and the margins as well. So , I think it's really hard to then say 
specifically this will improve by 100 basis points or 200 basis points.  
 
Damayanti Kerai: Sure, that's helpful. Thank you very much.   
 
Puneet Maheshwari:  Thanks, Damayanti. We request you to please limit your questions to 2 , 
but not more than 3 per participant with this. The next question is from 
Sumit. Sumit, can you please ask a question?   
 
Sumit Gupta:  Hi, thank you for the opportunity. My question is to Varun. What is the 
ARPOB of QCIL? 
 
Varun Khanna: Hey, Sumit. All right. So, again, I think sometimes ARPOB is a misnomer 
and Sunil mention about it. We've released the number, which is the ARPP 
number. The ARPP growth is 10% for this quarter.  The ARPOB number 
would be about INR 44,000, if that's the number in specific you're looking 
at for Q2, for QCIL. 
 
Puneet Maheshwari: Thanks. So, we have the next question. Again, joining back to the queue, 
Mr. Tausif. Tausif, can you please ask the question? 
 
Tausif Shaikh: Hey, thanks for the follow -up. Ramesh, can you share some color on the 
18 Aster DM Healthcare Limited – Q2 FY26 Earnings Conference Call  
recently commercialised Kasargod Hospital, how the early trends are, and 
does this hospital stop current patient in Kerala to travel to Karnataka for 
treatment? 
 
Ramesh Kumar: On October 2nd, we have launched the hospital. It is a 264 bedded hospital 
and right now we have opened 100 beds. The other 2 would be shortly 
commissioned as well. And the OPD numbers are anywhere between 150-
200 on any given day. So that's a head start what we had. If you look at 
Inpatient, we are talking around 35 -40 inpatients. IP admissions, we are 
around 7 number, 7 to anywhere between 10 admissions are happening.  
Discharges are also on the same.  We have the best of the clinicians 
onboarded. So, it's a higher tertiary care center. So Kasargod, I don't think 
so, in and around Kasargod, you have such a higher tertiary care center, 
which even Oncology where MedOnc  and even S urgical Oncology, we 
have started there.  Right now, all patients are accessing Kasargod 
Hospital. O nce the awareness is pretty high, we have started a good 
amount of campaign, a good amount of public  awareness programs. So, 
I'm sure patients have started flowing into the hospital. I don't think so 
they're cutting across Karnataka now. Because this is one of the state-of-
the-art centre what we have come up. 
 
Tausif Shaikh: Thanks Ramesh, that’s helpful.  
 
Puneet Maheshwari:  Thanks, Tausif. We have Sumit joining back to the queue. Sumit, now you 
can ask the question. 
 
Sumit Gupta: Okay. My question is to Varun . So, what was the performance of the 
mature and the focus units in this quarter? And have you witnessed any 
margin improvement in the focus units? 
 
Varun Khanna: So, Sumit, I gave some numbers earlier. So, our mature units, actually from 
a top standpoint, grew 14.5% YoY. Our emerging units grew 85% YoY, and 
our focus units grew 9% YoY.   
 
Sumit Gupta:  And how should we look at it, look at the units over the next 3-4 years?  
And is there any kind of margin improvement in the at least the focus units 
and the mature units?   
 
Varun Khanna: Of course. In the emerging and the focus units, margin expansion is the 
reason why they are in that category.  And that certainly will happen.  And 
I don't see a question around it.  As I mentioned earlier, a couple of units, 
or more in our focus group, have started to do extremely well. Our 
Hyderabad units were a bit challenged last year, if you recall. And that's 
where we've started to see. In fact, the last month of the 2nd quarter, our 
numbers were mid-double-digit growth rate for our Hyderabad assets. So, 
I think that's looking good. So, there's a significant turnaround underway 
in the focus units. And emerging, of course, the newer units will do well.  
Also, another hospital in Perinthalmanna , where we had challenges 
around it, was a part of the focus unit, is doing extremely well now. In fact, 
we are now looking at adding complexity there. One of the linear 
accelerators that I spoke about is getting into Perinthalmanna. We've just 
ordered a robot for Perinthalmanna. So, again, the strategy continues to 
be the same. Bring in more complexity, more modalities, ensure that, you 
know, anything and everything that the patients want are delivered in our 
centers.  And with that said, you will continue to see patient retention in 
a significant way, and therefore, complexity, pa yor mix, etc., growing,

leading to an evolved margin condition. 
 
Sumit Gupta: Understood. Thank you 
 
Puneet Maheshwari: Thanks, Sumit. I will request to attendees, please raise your hand for any 
question to the management. The next question is from Mr. Gaurav.  
Gaurav, can you please ask your question? 
 
Gaurav: Yeah, thank you.  My question is to Mr. Varun. So broadly, if I look at Aster 
and Quality Care, all the parameters are comparable. In fact, Quality Care 
is doing better. But if you look at the ALOS, Aster is at 3.2 and Quality Care 
is at 3.9.  I just wanted to understand why this delta is there?  Is it because 
of the case mix or something? How can this go and how will that help our 
capacity in the future? 
 
Varun Khanna: If I start defining as to why the 3.9, I think it may not be fair. So, it's driven 
by multiple factors. It's driven by the specialty that you focus on. It's driven 
by what kind of surgical mix you have, etc.  How much is the medical mix? 
If you're able to do, sometimes medicine can stay longer, etc. So, I think a 
lot of the way I'd look at it is not really compared to.  The second part of 
your question, the way I read it is, is there  scope to enhance it? Yes. Our 
focus will be to continue enhancing that. We've bettered over the last year 
by 6%.  As I told you that we were in excess of 4 , we've come down to 
about 3.85.  Will this continue to improve?  My sense is yes, if that answers 
your question. 
 
Gaurav: Thank you. 
 
Puneet Maheshwari: Thanks Varun . If anyone has any other attendees would like to ask a 
question, please raise your hand. Okay, that's been the last question. So , 
there is no more question to the management.  Thank you all. This 
concludes the earnings call for this quarter for Ast er DM  Healthcare. I 
thank the management and all the attendees for joining us today. If you 
have any further questions and queries, please do get in touch with us.  
Thank you.  Thanks, everyone.
