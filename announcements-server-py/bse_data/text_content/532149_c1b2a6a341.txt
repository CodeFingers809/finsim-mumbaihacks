The rating(s) are specific to the terms and conditions of the instruments as indicated to us by you, and any change in the terms or 
size of the same would require a review of the rating(s) by us. In case there is any change in the terms and conditions or the size of 
the rated instrument, the same must be brought to our notice before the instrument is used by you. In the event such changes 
occur after the rating(s) have been assigned by us and their use has been confirmed by you, the rating(s) would be subject to our 
review, following which there could be a change in the rating(s) previously assigned. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any change in 
the over-all limit of the instrument from that specified in this letter, would constitute an enhancement that would not be covered 
by or under the said Rating Agreement. 
The rating(s) assigned must be understood solely as an opinion and should not be treated, or cause to be treated, as 
recommendation to buy, sell, or hold the rated [Instrument] availed/issued by your company. 
You are also requested to forthwith inform us about any default or delay in repayment of interest or principal amount of the 
instrument rated, as above, or any other debt instruments/ borrowing and keep us informed of any other developments which may

utilize the penny-drop verification service as provided by banks. This measure is intended to prevent payment failures when 
disbursing principal and/or interest to respective investors or debenture holders.

payments. Once an account has been verified through this facility, it can be used for subsequent transactions related to interest 
and principal payments, thereby ensuring successful remittance and avoiding failure.
