Limited Review Report on unaudited standalone financial results of Exide Industries 
Limited for the quarter ended 30 September 2025 and year to date results for the 
period from 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025 pursuant to Regulation 33 of 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listjng Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended 
To the Board of Directors of Exide Industries Limited 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of unaudited standalone financial results of Exide
Industries Limited (hereinafter referred to as "the Company") for the quarter ended 30 September
2025 and year to date results for the period from 01 April 2025 to 30 September 2025 ("the
Statement").
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's management and approved by its Board
of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid
down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" ("Ind AS 34"), prescribed under
Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India
and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, ·as amended ("Listing Regulations").
Our responsibility is to issue a report on the Statement based on our review.
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements
(SRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the
Entity", issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting
matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope
than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable
us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified
in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe
that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement
principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standard and other accounting principles
generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of
Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it
contains any material misstatement.

Limited Review Report on unaudited consolidated financial results of Exide 
Industries Limited for the quarter ended 30 September 2025 and year to date results 
for the period from 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025 pursuant to Regulation 33 of 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended 
To the Board of Directors of Exide Industries Limited 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of unaudited consolidated financial results of Exide
Industries Limited (hereinafter referred to as "the Parent"), and its subsidiaries (the Parent and its
subsidiaries together referred to as "the Group") and its share of the net profit after tax and total
comprehensive income of its associates for the quarter ended 30 September 2025 and year to date

the Parent pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the Securities and Exchange Board of
India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended ("Listing
Regulations").
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Parent's management and approved by the Parent's
Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement
principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting' ("Ind AS 34"),
prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and other accounting principles generally
accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. Our responsibility
is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review.
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements
(SRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the
Entity", issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting
matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope
than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable
us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified
in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
We also performed procedures in accordance with the circular issued by the Securities and Exchange
Board of India under Regulation 33(8) of the Listing Regulations, to the extent applicable.
4. The Statement includes the results of the following entities:

5. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above and based
on the consideration of the review report of the other auditor referred to in paragraph 6 below, nothing
has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in
accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian
Accounting Standard and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed
the information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations, including
the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
6. We did not review the interim financial information of one subsidiary included in the Statement, whose
interim financial information reflects total assets (before consolidation adjustments) of Rs.1, 140.44
crores as at 30 September 2025 and total revenues (before consolidation adjustments) of Rs.
1,447.49 crores and Rs. 2,940.55 crores , total net profit after tax (before consolidation adjustments)
of Rs. 9.58 crores and Rs. 4.64 crores and total comprehensive income (before consolidation
adjustments) of Rs. 9.72 crores and Rs 4.73 crores, for the quarter ended 30 September 2025 and
for the period from 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025 respectively, and cash flows (net) (before
consolidation adjustments) of Rs 2.10 Crores for the period from 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025
as considered in the Statement. This interim financial information has been reviewed by other auditor
whose report has been furnished to us by the Parent's management and our conclusion on the
Statement, in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of this subsidiary,
is based solely on the report of the other auditor and the procedures performed by us as stated in 
paragraph 3 above.
Our conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter.
7. The Statement includes the interim financial information of four Subsidiaries which have not been
reviewed, whose interim financial information reflect total assets (before consolidation adjustments)
of Rs. 339.68 Crores as at 30 September 2025 and total revenues (before consolidation adjustments)

outflows (net) (before consolidation adjustments) of Rs. 3.68 Crores for the period from 1 April 2025

Press Release

Key business highlights 
• GST 2.0 reform as announced on 15th Aug'25, is a welcome move by the government and
expected to drive consumption going forward. The GST rate on batteries were reduced
from 28% to 18% effective 22nd Sept'25. The Company is fully aligned to the Government's
goal of reducing burden to the end-consumer by passing on the full benefit of the GST
rate reduction to the consumer.
• Any large reform like GST 2.0 is accompanied by short term challenges. The Company
started on a strong note in this quarter with double digit growth in the Trade Business.
However, we experienced a shift in momentum once the GST rate cuts were announced
on 15th August. Our channel partners postponed their buying in anticipation of receiving
new stocks with updated prices.
• The Company took production cuts in August and September in anticipation of the
subdued demand in this quarter. This helped in reducing inventory significantly at the end
of September. However, the drop in demand also led to lower profitability because of
under-recovery of fixed costs.

• Despite the challenges, the Company achieved standalone revenues of Rs. 8688 Crore
during Hl FY26, registering an increase of 1.3% on a YoY basis. Domestic business grew
by 5% YoY. Export business continue to be significantly impacted in certain markets and
tariff linked challenges.
• EBITDA margin for H1FY26 was 10.9% primarily impacted by higher input materials prices
and hence there remains a continuous pressure on material cost. The Company is accruing
benefits from various cost excellence project to partially offset the adverse cost impacts.
• The Company expects growth in the current quarter (03 FY26) to come back much
stronger, especially in trade and Auto OEM business which are seeing significant benefits
from the GST rate cut move by the Government.
• Liquidity position remains comfortable with zero debt and high cash flow generation.
Key information about business verticals 
• Solar business was the fastest growing supported by various government programs.
• Overall Trade Mobility showed double digit growth in Hl.
• Industrial Infra business (excluding Telecom) performance has improved on YoY basis as
order inflow and order execution picking up in sectors like power, railways, traction, etc.
• Reserve Power vertical has been impacted due to prolonged monsoon in almost all parts
of the country resulting in de-growth during Q2.
• Exports business showed degrowth due to geo-political tension and tariff uncertainties.
Other key updates 
• EESL's (Exide Energy Solutions Limited) project site is witnessing steady progress. Exide
Industries Limited has invested Rs 580 crores in H1FY26 and further Rs 65 crores in Oct'25

Below are some latest pictures of the lithium-ion cell manufacturing project site: 
Commenting on the performance - Mr. Avik Roy, MD & CEO, said: 
'We had a strong first half of the quarter until mid-August when the GST cut was announced. 
The growth was muted in the second half, especially in trade business, driven by channel de­
stocking. However, it is a welcome move by the government as it will drive demand in H2 FY26. 
Global trade situation remained uncertain and impacted our exports. 
Domestic Macro outlook is favourable with low inflation, low interest rates and higher 
disposable incomes. We expect the strong growth momentum, especially in Trade and 
Automotive OEM business, to be back in Q3 
There is continuous pressure from input material costs. In this environment, the company's 
priority has been on managing profitable growth and focusing on preserving cash. We pro­
actively cut down production in the second half of the quarter in anticipation of the muted 
demand from channel partners. This helped us to reduce our inventory levels. Investments in 
our manufacturing technologies have started showing results which will be further realized as 
volumes grow. 
In our lithium-ion cell manufacturing project, construction work is going on in full swing to 
ensure timely project completion. We wish to commercialise operations in FY26.'
