WIND SECTOR IN INDIA – A MULTI-DECADAL GROWTH STORY BOOSTED BY 
FAVORABLE POLICY & REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
12
INDIA WIND SECTOR – A MULTI-DECADAL GROWTH STORY
Sources: CEA, SECI, MNRE, NIWE, GWEC, NITI Aayog, PIB, National Green Hydrogen Mission , JMK Research
• India targets 122 GW of installed wind capacity from 53 GW currently  – provides visibility of > Rs 5 trn for wind OEMs 
and a large multi-year opportunity for O&M service providers
• Demand from commercial & industrial (C&I) players for renewable power continues to be strong due to its green 
credentials and price arbitrage w.r.t. grid based / merchant power.
• India’s Green Hydrogen targets of 5 mmtpa may result in incremental ~ 125 GW of RE capacity addition (solar + wind)
• Wind continues to be one of the cheapest sources of power, much lower than APPC
• Wind’s complementarity to solar in Indian conditions makes it an important source for grid stabilization and higher grid 
utilization 
• Hybrid / RTC / FDRE projects, with significant proportion of wind capacity, is the way forward due to: 1. Higher project 
PLFs, 2. Increased grid utilization & stability, 3. Round-the-clock generation potentially replacing conventional sources for 
base power supply, 4. Lower LCoE and better IRRs for project developers
• GST on wind components reduced from 12% to 5%
• MNRE notifies ALMM (Wind) and ALMM (Wind Turbine Components) mandating domestic sourcing of ~75-80% of WTG 
components including blades, towers, gearbox, generators and special bearings, as well as locating R&D, data centers & 
servers within India
• CERC has notified amendments to connectivity and GNA regulations for ISTS, allowing hybridization of existing solar and 
wind transmission projects with capacity upwards of 50 MW.
• India’s onshore wind potential stands at 695 GW at 120m hub height and 1,164 GW at 150m hub height
• NIWE estimates India’s repowering potential at ~ 25 GW across multiple states
• India has announced a VGF scheme for setting up 1 GW of offshore wind capacity with ~ Rs 7,500 crore outlay
