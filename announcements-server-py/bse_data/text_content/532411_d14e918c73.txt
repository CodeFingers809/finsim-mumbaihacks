Independent Auditors Limited Review Report on Unaudited Standalone Financial Results of the 
company for the Quarter and half vear ended September 30, 2025 (Pursuant to the Regulation 33 of 
the SEBI (Listing Obligation and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 as amended. 
The Board of Directors, 
MPS Infotecnics Limited 
We have reviewed the accompanying statement of Unaudited Standalone Financial Results of M/s MPS 
Infotecnics Limited for the Quarter and half year Ended September 30, 2025 ("the Statement"), being 
submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended. 
This statement which is the responsibility of the Company’s Management and has been approved by the 
Board of Directors has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid 
down in the Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" ("Ind AS 34"), prescribed under 
Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to issue a report on these financial statements 
based on our review. 
We have conducted our review in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagement (SRE) 2410, 
Engagements to “Review of Interim Financial Information performed by Independent Auditor of the 
entities”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and 
perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of company personnel and an analytical procedure 
applied to financial data and thus provides less assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit 
and accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.

year Ended September 30, 2025.

loss account, reserves, and surplus is not ascertained. 
Investment in subsidiaries Rs. 61.75 Crores - There are no operations in these overseas subsidiaries and no 
audit of accounts has been done and no updated information has been received. No provision has been made 
for the shortfall in value of the investment in accordance with Ind AS 36;

The Company has shown in the balance sheet, bank balances in Banco Efisa (Lisbon Portugal) amounting to 
Rs. 347,892,163 (USD 8,883,210.75) which the bank has adjusted and the matter is in the court of law. 
Consequently the bank balances shown in balance sheet are overstated by Rs. 347,892,163/- The above 
bank balance relates to FY 2008-09 which is treated as a current asset. No provision has been made for the 
possible loss on account of the same. 
Other non-current assets include other loans and advances of Rs. 222.09 Cr. which are considered to be good 
for recovery. However as the terms and conditions regarding these loans have not been provided to us we 
are unable to ascertain and comment on the extent of realizability of this asset; 
The Company had increased its Authorized Capital from Rs. 52.45 Crores to Rs. 377.50 crores during the 
period from FY-2010 -11 to FY 2012-13. However necessary form i.e. Form SH-7 (Earlier Form-2) could not 
be filed and appropriate fees could not be paid. By the time the Company could file Form SH-7, the 
Companies Act, 1956 was replaced by The Companies Act, 2013 and accordingly the Companies 
(Registration office and fees) Rules, 2014 came into effect from 1st April 2014. According to these rules, the 
fees payable on increase in Authorised Capital increased many fold. Though the company had increased the 
Authorised capital during the FY 2010-11 to 2012-13, but the company was asked by the authorities to pay 
the fees in terms of the provisions of Companies Act, 2013 and not under the Companies Act, 1956. 
Representations were made with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, but did not bore any fruit hence The 
Company filed writ petition before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court which was dismissed vide order dated 
15/01/2019, Aggrieved by the orders passed by the Hon’ble Delhi High Court, the company had preferred 
Special Leave Petition (SLP) before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. The Hon’ble Supreme Court vide its 
order dated 7th November 2023 has dismissed the said SLP. Upon dismissal of the said SLP, the ROC fees in 
terms of provisions of Companies Act, 2013 has become due and payable. The company has already 
provided for The normal Fees of Rs. 16,252,500.00 and additional fees of Rs. 61,862,728.36 as on 31st 
March 2024 as per the provisions of Companies Act, 1956. In terms of the provisions of the Companies 
(Registration Office and Fees) Rules, 2014, the normal fees and Additional fees computed is Rs. 
24,378,750.00 and Rs. 121,160,106.80 respectively. As on 31st March 2025 provision amounting to Rs. 
81,26,250/- and Rs. 5,92,97,378/- towards normal fees and Additional Fees i.e. the difference between the 
fees computed as per the Companies Act, 1956 and fees computed as per Companies Act, 2013 has been 
made. Out of the additional fees amounting to Rs. 5,92,97,378/-, Rs. 8,776,350.00 relate to the financial year 
2024-25 and Rs. 50,521,028.45 relates to previous financial years. For the half year ended 30.09.2025, a 
provision of Rs. 44,00,197/- computed as per Companies Act 2013, has been made towards additional fees 
for the half year ended 30.09.2025 and total fees (Normal and additional) amounting to Rs. 14,99,39,054/- 
appearing under the head “Current Liabilities. There is no further impact on the financial statements of the 
Company 
Income Tax for the Assessment year 2013-14 amounting to Rs. 20.80 lacs and interest thereon is still 
payable although principal liability has been provided in the books of Accounts. 
The Company has considered sundry debtors of Rs. 1,660.09 Lacs due for more than six months as good. 
However in the opinion of auditors there should be a regular process of identification and making provision 
for bad and doubtful debts. Such a process has not been followed. We therefore are unable to comment on 
the extent of un-provided bad and doubtful debts and their impact on loss and reserves. 
SEBI investigated the GDR issue of the Company and SEBI vide its order dated 6th March 2020 restrained 
the company from accessing the securities market and further prohibited from buying, selling or dealing in 
securities, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever or being associated with the securities market in 
any manner whatsoever, till compliance with directions contained in the said order, and for an additional 
period of 2 years from the date of bringing back the money. Further SEBI vide its order dated 27.11.2020 
had imposed a penalty of Rs. 10,00,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Crores) on the Company. Since the penalty has not 
been paid, SEBI has also frozen the Bank Accounts of the Company. Against the said orders of SEBI the 
Company filed appeals before the Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT). SAT vides tder~dated 
27/09/2023 has reduced the penalty from Rs. 10,00,00,000/- to Rs. 25,00,000/-. The review | led-agai

the said order of SAT was dismissed vide order dated 8th December 2023. Aggrieved by the said order the 
Company had filed Special Leave Petition before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. The Hon’ble Apex Court 
vide its order dated 16th April 2024 dismissed the said Appeal. The Review Petition filed before the Hon’ble 
Apex Court was also dismissed vide order dated 26th September 2024. The company has not paid the 
penalty amount of Rs. 25.00 lacs, as of the date of this Audit Report, but necessary provision w.r.t. to the 
penalty of Rs. 25 lacs has been made in the books which appear under the head “Current Liabilities”, 
however, provision w.r.t. interest @ 12% p.a. from November 2020 to September 2025 aggregating to Rs. 
14.75 lacs (Out of which Rs. 1.50 lac relates to Half Year ended 30.09.2025) has not been provided in the 
Books. To the extent of Rs.14.75 lacs the losses are under stated. 
Listing fees for FY 2022-23, 2023-24, 2024-25 and 2025-26 to NSE and BSE amounting to Rs. 28.08 lacs & 
Rs. 24.02 lacs respectively is due and outstanding. Since the Listing Fees has not been paid the demat 
accounts of promoters have been frozen by the Exchanges in terms of the provisions of Chapter VII, Section 
VII(A) of the SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/ CIR/P/2023/120 dated July 11, 2023 
(Erstwhile SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/CMD/CIR/P/2020/12 dated January 22, 2020). In terms of the 
invoices raised by the exchange, the delay in payment of Annual Listing Fees attracts interest @ 18% p.a. by 
NSE and 12% p.a. by BSE. Provision for interest on the outstanding Annual Listing Fees amounting to Rs. 
9.71 Lacs and Rs. 4.95 Lacs to NSE and BSE respectively has not been made. 
Custodial Charges to CDSL & NSDL for FY 2023-24 and 2024-25 amounting to Rs. 124.99 lacs & Rs. 17.49 
lacs respectively is outstanding due to which the depositories have blocked Benpos data. The Company has 
raised disputes with the Depositories and has made representations with the Depositories & SEBI. Further, 
the delay in payment of Annual Custodial Charges to the depositories attracts interest @ 12% p.a. Since the 
company has disputed the charges being charged by the Depositories hence no provision towards Annual 
Custodial Charges has been made in the books of account w.r.t. Custodial charges payable to CDSL & NSDL 
hence losses of the company to the extent of Rs. 142.48 lacs (being Annual Custodial Charges for FY 2023-24 
& 2024-25) are under stated. However, company has disclosed the said liability under the head “Contingent 
Liability” in the Financial Statements. Further custodial charges for the FY 2025-26( Amount not 
ascertainable) due to CDSL and NSDL have also not been provided in the books of accounts. 
Consequently Annual General Meeting of the Company which was scheduled to be held on or before 30th 
December 2023 (the extended time) for FY 2022-23 and on or before 30th September 2024 for FY 2023-24 
had not been convened which is in contravention of the provisions of sections 96, 97 & 98 of the Companies 
Act, 2013 which is punishable under section 99 of the Companies Act, 2013. Consequently, the Audited 
financial statements of the Company for the FY 2022-23 and 2023-24 are not adopted by Shareholders of the 
Company till the date of the Limited Review Report for the half year ended 30.09.2025. 
Consequently Shareholding Pattern for the quarter ended 30/09/2023; 31/12/2023 ,31/03/2024, 
30/06/2024, 30/09/2024, 31/12/2024 & 31/03/2025, pursuant to the provisions of Regulation 31(1)(b) of

published a public notice in Business Standard on 6th February 2025 in compliance with the said delisting 
regulations though without informing the Company. The Company took note of the same and the company 
vide its letter dated 21st February 2025 sought an opportunity of personal hearing. The said request was 
acceded to by NSE and NSE vide its email dated 18th March 2025 requested the company and its promoter 
to attend the meeting of the De-listing Committee scheduled for 7th April 2025. Due to the wedding of Mr. 
Peeyush Aggarwal’s daughter during that period, the Company requested a rescheduling of the meeting to a 
date after April 27, 2025. NSE accepted this request and subsequently scheduled the Delisting Committee 
meeting for June 26, 2025.Mr. Peeyush Kumar Aggarwal, Promoter Director of the Company, attended the 
meeting on June 26, 2025. During the meeting, the Delisting Committee requested the Company to submit a 
detailed representation. The Company submitted its representation to NSE on July 4, 2025. A response from 
NSE is currently awaited. 
The Company received a Show Cause Notice (SCN) bearing No. LIST/COMP/AS/SCN/223/2025-26 dated 
June 10, 2025, from BSE Limited, requiring the Company to show cause as to why its equity shares should 
not be delisted pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Delisting of Equity Shares) 
Regulations, 2011.The Company duly responded to the SCN on 21.06.2025. BSE Limited provided the 
Company with an opportunity for a personal hearing before its Delisting Committee and requested a formal 
representation, including the request for such a hearing. On June 21, 2025, BSE Limited published an Initial 
Public Notice regarding the proposed delisting of the Company in Financial Express and Navshakti. 
Subsequently, BSE, vide letter No. LIST/COMP/MR/326/532411/2025-26 dated July 15, 2025, granted a 
personal hearing before the Delisting Committee, scheduled to be held via video conferencing on August 6, 
2025, between 9:30 AM and 11:30 AM. The Exchange also requested submission of a detailed representation 
prior to the hearing. The Company confirmed its availability for the scheduled hearing. However, due to the 
unfortunate demise of the mother of Mr. Peeyush Kumar Aggarwal, Promoter Director of the Company, a 
request was made on July 30, 2025, to reschedule the meeting. The Stock Exchange vide email dated 16th 
October 2025 has reschduled the personal hearing to 10/11/2025 which was attended by Mr. Peeyush 
Kumar Aggarwal, Director and Principal Promoter of the Company . Prior to the personal Hearing the 
Company has filed its Written submission vide email dated 04/11/2025. As on the date of Board meeting, it 
is being informed that in the personal hearing granted to Mr. Peeyush Kumar Aggarwal, the Exchange has 
advised us to pay the outstanding listing fees by 28th February 2026 and make good the non-compliances by 
31st march 2026. There is nothing further to add, 
Mr. Peeyush Kumar Aggarwal, was managing Director of the Company till 9th August 2024 on which date he 
resigned from his post. The Company since then has not appointed Managing Director or CEO. The non- 
appointment of Managing Director or CEO attracts penalty on the company and the Directors and KMPs in 
terms of the provisions of section 203 of the Companies Act, 2013. Additionally, the current composition of 
the Board of Directors does not comply with Regulation 17(1) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015. As the Company is classified among the top 2000 listed entities 
by market capitalization for the financial year 2023-24, it is required to maintain an appropriate board 
structure in accordance with the said regulation i.e., minimum six members on the Board. The company has 
since appointed Mr. Ram Niwas Sharma as CEO w.e.f. May 21, 2025

figures). The above bank balance relates to FY 2008-09 which is treated as a current asset. No provision has been made for the possible loss on account of the

(c) Opening Stock (Source Codes) - Rs. 62.22 Crores 
In the absence of valuation reports of above assets the extent of impairment and its impact on profit 
and loss account, reserves and surplus is not ascertained. 
Assets of subsidiaries - Rs. 18.60 Crore. Total’Revenue of Rs. Nil and Net Cash outflows / 
Inflows of Rs. Nil - No audit of the subsidiaries has been done either by us or local audit firm have 
been audited. such unaudited financial statements and information furnished to us by the 
Management. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, in so far as it relates to the 
amounts and disclosure included in respect of these subsidiaries and our report in terms of 
subsections 3 and 11 of section 143 of the Act, in so far as it relates to the aforesaid subsidiaries, 
is based solely on such un-audited financial information. 
Goodwill amounting to Rs. 61.69 Crores- There are no operations in these overseas subsidiaries 
and no audit of accounts has been done and no updated information has been received. No 
provision has been made for the shortfall in value of the investment in accordance with Ind AS. 
The Company has shown in the balance sheet, bank balances in Banco Efisa (Lisbon Portugal) 
amounting to Rs. 347,892,163 (USD 8,883,210.75) which the bank has adjusted and the matter is 
in the court of law. Consequently the bank balances shown in balance sheet are overstated by Rs. 
347,892,163/- The above bank balance relates to FY 2008-09 which is treated as a current asset. 
No provision has been made for the possible loss on account of the same. 
Other non-current assets include other loans and advances of Rs. 222.21 Cr. which are considered 
to be good for recovery. However as the terms and conditions regarding these loans have not been 
provided to us we are unable to ascertain and comment on the extent of realizability of this asset; 
The Company had increased its Authorized Capital from Rs. 52.45 Crores to Rs. 377.50 crores 
during the period from FY-2010 -11 to FY 2012-13. However necessary form i.e. Form SH-7 (Earlier 
Form-2) could not be filed and appropriate fees could not be paid. By the time the Company could 
file Form SH-7, the Companies Act, 1956 was replaced by The Companies Act, 2013 and accordingly 
the Companies (Registration office and fees) Rules, 2014 came into effect from 1st April 2014. 
According to these rules, the fees payable on increase in Authorised Capital increased many fold. 
Though the company had increased the Authorised capital during the FY 2010-11 to 2012-13, but 
the company was asked by the authorities to pay the fees in terms of the provisions of Companies 
Act, 2013 and not under the Companies Act, 1956. Representations were made with the Ministry of 
Corporate Affairs, but did not bore any fruit hence The Company filed writ petition before the 
Hon’ble Delhi High Court which was dismissed vide order dated 15/01/2019, Aggrieved by the 
orders passed by the Hon’ble Delhi High Court, the company had preferred Special Leave Petition 
(SLP) before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. The Hon’ble Supreme Court vide its order dated

loss and reserves.

attracts interest @ 12% p.a. Since the company has disputed the charges being charged by the 
Depositories hence no provision towards Annual Custodial Charges has been made in the books of 
account w.r.t. Custodial charges payable to CDSL & NSDL hence losses of the company to the extent 
of Rs. 142.48 lacs (being Annual Custodial Charges for FY 2023-24 & 2024-25) are under stated.
