Notes to Operational Performance 
1. Revenue Growth 
Revenue has increased by 4.57 % YoY. Growth remains muted as the Company is currently operating at 
near 100% capacity. Ongoing capital expenditure (refer to “Business & Capital Expenditure Highlights”) is 
expected to be commercially operational by 31st January 2026, enabling sustainable growth over the next 
several years. 
 
2. Improved Gross Profit & Margins 
Despite muted revenue growth, EBITDA and PBT (excluding Other Income) increased by 53.61% and 
45%, respectively, supported by an improvement in gross profit. The improvement is driven by:  
a. Better product mix, resulting in stronger realisations. 
b. Boiler steel approval, received during FY 2025–26, which has enabled premium pricing of the 
product. 
This improvement in realisations is expected to continue over the next 2–3 years. 
 
3. Resilient Profitability Despite Higher Costs 
EBITDA and PBT growth were achieved despite higher employee costs and depreciation, both linked to 
the ongoing capex and the hiring required for new facilities. Revenue contribution from the new capacity is 
expected from Q4 FY 2025–26.

Business & Capital Expenditure Highlights  
AMIC Forging Limited procures high-quality ingots which are forged and precision-machined in-house to 
deliver fully finished components tailored to customer specifications. 
A majority of the ongoing capital expenditure is directed towards backward integration, specifically 
establishing in-house ingot manufacturing capability and expanding forging and machining capacity. These 
strategic investments enable us to become a fully integrated precision engineering c ompany which is a pre-
requisite for approvals in certain industry like aerospace etc. These investments will also help us achieving 
operational efficiency at scale - supporting long term sustainable growth.

Note: The previously committed go-live date was 1 September 2025, but civil construction was delayed due 
to heavy rainfall in West Bengal. 
Key Milestones Achieved in FY 2025–26 
Boiler Steel Approval 
The Company received boiler steel approval 
during FY 2025–26. This certification 
reinforces the quality of AMIC products and 
supports premium realisation. 
 
Strategic Supply Agreement 
AMIC Forging Limited has entered into an agreement with 
Prime Metal for the supply of rolls. Prime Metal is a joint 
venture of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, further validating 
AMIC’s capabilities in high-precision forging. 
 
Director’s Message – Mr. Anshul Chamaria 
“At AMIC Forging Limited, we have made significant investments in machinery, 
people, and technical know-how. We have worked diligently to obtain critical 
industry approvals that enable us to manufacture complex and high-precision 
engineering products. 
There was an unavoidable delay in capex going commercially live due to 
unprecedented heavy rainfall in West Bengal, which disrupted foundation and civil 
work. With the capex now nearing completion and the essential approvals in place, 
AMIC Forging Limited is well-positioned for the next phase of growth.”
