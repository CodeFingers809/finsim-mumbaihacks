Future Opportunities 
Global E-waste Monitor 2024: Key Updates Ecoreco’ Eco Recycling Limited 
Accelerated E-waste Generation: 
* Global E-waste surpassed 62.5 Mn metric tones (Mt) annually, exceeding previous projections. 
Marginal Improvement in Recycling: 
* Documented recycling increased from 17.4% in 2020 to 21% in 2024, leaving approximately 79% of E-waste 
improperly managed. 
Escalating Environmental Concerns: 
* Annual COz-equivalent emissions from mismanaged E-waste now exceed 100 million Mt. 
* Increased reliance on non-renewable resources for electronics production. 
Regional Performance: 
* Leaders: Europe boasts collection rates over 50% due to stringent policies like the WEEE Directive; Japan 
and South Korea implement effective extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes. 
* Lagging Regions: Africa and Asia face challenges with limited formal recycling infrastructure, leading to 
reliance on informal sectors with associated health and environmental risks. 
Emerging Challenges: 
* Proliferation of devices with embedded lithium-ion batteries increases fire hazards during disposal and 
recycling processes. 
* Integration of Al and robotics in recycling is enhancing material recovery efficiency.

Precious Metal Recovery: Unlocking Gold, Silver & More From E-waste @) Ecoreco — o0 0— 
Besides curbing informal 
E-waste practices and preventing the introduction 
of harmful substances into the environment, 
embracing systematic recycling methods presents 
an opportunity to reclaim valuable metals such as 
gold, silver, palladium and platinum. 
In E-waste, there are 17 precious metals that can 
be extracted technologically. 
| These metals become available for industries to 
use, promoting self-reliance. 
Implementation of scientific approaches allows to 
extract pure precious & rare earth metals, which 
can then be redeployed into circular ecosystem.
