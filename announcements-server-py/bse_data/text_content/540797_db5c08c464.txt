The growth has been attributed to a couple of things. We have initiated cutting-edge technology 
by introducing robots in our product portfolio, not only to boost our implant sales but also to 
generate robotical income -- rental income from the hospitals. 
We have launched Duraniom, the only U.S. FDA-approved U.S. manufactured TiNbN knee in 
India and continued efforts on sales and marketing across India, U.S.A. and Southeast Asia. On 
COGS reduction, our implant manufacturing entity COGS has been reduced by 9% on a year-
on-year basis and 3% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. 
From a supply chain excellence, we will establ ish multiple vendors to mitigate tariff impacts 
and improve procurement and trade efficiencies, aiming to reduce cost by 15% to 20%. 
Distribution efficiencies will be tailored to each market to ensure timely and cost-effective 
delivery. We have improved our order-to-cash and asset utilization and started to address our 
high inventory.  
Further inventory improvements will be an area of continued focus in 2026 to enhance working 
capital and ROCE. Capacity improvement, we have done, but we still have some distance to 
cover, which will happen during the end of quarter 3 and start of quarter 4. 
From an organization and talent development standpoint, new engineering leadership set up and 
setting up an R&D office in India is happening in this quarter as well as in U.S.A. to drive new 
product development. 
In conclusion, our roadmap for 2025-2026 is designed to drive sustainable growth, operational 
efficiency and innovation leadership in the orthopedic market. We are confident that our 
strategic initiatives combined with favorable market dynamics and technological advancements 
will position us strongly for the future. 
Thank you for your continued support and trust. We look forward to a successful year. Thank 
you so much. Over to you, Amit. 
Amit Kumar: So we can now move to Q&A session. 
Moderator: Thank you, now we will begin our Question-Answer session. Any one who wishes to ask 
question, may press * and 1 on their touchtone telephone. If you wish to remove from 
queue, you may press * & 2. Participants are requested to use their handset for asking the 
question. Ladeis and Gentlemen, we will wait while the queue assembles.  
The first question is from the line of Kush Jain, an Individual Investor, please go ahead Mr. Kush 
you can unmute yourself and go ahead with the question. 
Kush Jain: My question is regarding the Shalby International Hospital. This quarter, the hospital reported a 
year-on-year revenue decline and EBITDA loss and very low occupancy rate of 21%. Could you 
share the specific challenges this hospital is faci ng in the market? And also share the detail of 
  Shalby Limited

the specific strategies that will be implemented to achieve high occupancy and become profitable 
as well as the expected timeline for this recovery. 
Amit Kumar: Yes. Thank you, Kush, for your question. In order to answer -- to answering your second 
question first on to the strategy, I would answer it into the threefold actions, which are underway. 
First of all, we have revisited and revised our marketing strategy for the unit in Gurgaon. And 
as a result, you see that we have rebranded the hospital from Sanar International to Shalby 
International, and it is widely deployed and you would be seeing that across very soon. 
The second, we have also done leadership restructuring, bringing in more stronger leadership, 
which is already has started taking actions. And that effect would also be coming in the 
upcoming quarters. Third and last, that we have  started onboarding new clinical talent. Certain 
steps have been taken and a few more renowned doctors would be in panel soon as the discussion 
is under conclusion with them. 
On to the performance, as overall, we are confid ent to see the hospital performing better to the 
optimum levels in about 2 quarters from here. And in the next year, we are pretty sure that we 
would have a positive EBITDA coming forward from these hospitals. 
Khush Jain: My next question is regarding the long-term growth of the implant business to become $1000 
million revenue, could you clarify if the growth is expected to lead by the particular U.S. market 
or new market entries? And furthermore, what are the specific strategies that's been employed 
to achieve this growth? 
Deepak Anand: So the growth powered by not only the U.S. market, but also the developing markets. U.S. will 
obviously play a role. But specifically on a gr owth standpoint, will be  a lot of development 
markets playing a role. How are we looking at from a future standpoint is, again, speaking about 
it is just going to be focused -- very focused on the 5 pillars that we are working towards right 
from ensuring that regulatory approvals in new markets and get sales going through our current 
channel of sales and distribution through channel partners as well as our own team members, 
reducing -- continued efforts to reduce cost, continued effort to increase the capacity. 
And fourth, but important one is our new product development. We have already -- like I said, 
we have set up an R&D which is a large team, which is starting to work on a lot of new product 
development. It is imperative to have the portfolio complete, so we are working towards that. 
And the last pillar would be right talent at the right place. So these are the 5 pillars that we'll be 
focusing on from -- to ensure that this is a sustained growth. And that's the strategy that we will 
be implementing. 
Khush Jain: So sir, how much capacity would be increased? 
Deepak Anand: So when -- if you're talking about our current plant, current plant itself, we have capacity to take 
care of our next 5 years need, so we'll be more focused on that to increase our current capacity.

It's just about adding shifts and maybe adding certain extra time hours and things like that, so 
which we are working towards. 
Khush Jain: ok Thank you. I am done with the question. 
Moderator: The next question comes from the line of Kashish Thakur from Elara Securities. 
Kashish Thakur: Hi, Thank you, Sir, a few questions from my end. Sir, so IP and OP volumes have declined in 
Q2, despite our ARPOB has increased around 5%. So what has led to this softness in the footfall? 
And what do you think in like H2 will there be  a recovery in volume? And how do you expect 
in that number? 
Amit Kumar: Yes. So I would request Nishita ma'am to answer this question. 
Nishita Shukla: If we see quarter 1 to quarter 2, there is 5% growth. But as comparative to last year quarter to 
this year's quarter, there were 3 major reasons for drop in OP and IP. The reasons mainly were 
heavy rainfalls during the season, which had a drop in patient footfall, walk-in footfalls as well 
as cancellations of all planned surgeries. 
Secondly, for the medicine part, there was no season for malaria and dengue this year if we 
compare to last year. And the third of which was also very important was our TPA negotiations 
were going on strongly. So like 5 to 6 TPAs were on hold, and that is how we had a surgical 
drop with that patient. 
Kashish Thakur: Understood ma'am. And how we are looking this volume recovery in H2? 
Nishita Shukla: So for volume recovery, if you see we are on a constant increase in good doctors, taking -- 
leading higher clinical teams. So last year, if you see, we were on  370 doctors at group level. 
And this year, it is now 454-doctors. So bringing in more doctors, more talent, as well as 
renegotiation of TPAs are nearly to be closed. So 3 of 5 companies have already closed with 
good rates and it will be again starting. And then again, more digital promotion and bring 
international promotion for Sanar. 
Kashish Thakur: Just 1 question on TPA. We have renegotiations with these companies after every 2 years or 
how is it? 
Nishita Shukla: No, this was mid negotiation as there were a lot of issues of deductions and rate revision. So 
usually, it is like 2 years, but they don't take it at 2 years, they make 4 years to give us the final 
new rate. But then this was all mix like -- there were a lot of deductions coming after approval 
from TPA and this was mid negotiation going on from their side to again reduce rates in between 
2 years. So that is how we had to keep some TPAs on hold. And now it has -- majority of them 
has been closed with a new renegotiated rates.

Kashish Thakur: My second question is on occupancy. What levels do you expect our occupancy -- like it has 
been hovering around 47% to 50% over quite a while. Like what push do we require so that our 
occupancy can go back to the levels of somewhere around 55%. 
Amit Kumar: So this is Amit. I would like to answer it. The an swer here is, one, the hospital in PK, which is 
operating at a low capacity. The actions I had already briefed which are underway to bring back 
the occupancy hire. 
For a minute, exclude the performance of that hos pital currently, the other hospital has already 
reached a 50% of occupancy mark. As soon the PK would be showing the traction which the 
measures are underway, we will soon see the consistent performance of the occupancy going up 
by about 400 to 500 basis points in the coming quarters. 
Kashish Thakur: Understood, understood. And 1 last question as of now, so stand-alone EBITDA margin has 
improved to 19.5%, right, this time around. So how sustainable is this margin? And like what 
kind of margins can we expect for FY '26 and going ahead for stand-alone business? 
Amit Kumar: So yes, on the stand-alone basis, the margin has about, for the quarter 2, 19.5%. And on to your 
question, how sustainable it is, the measures which have been taken are permanent, and they 
would be showing the consistent growth in the EBITDA margin as to what the forecast which 
we see, it would surely be increasing from here to a trend line of 200 to 300 basis points. 
Kashish Thakur: Understood. And really growth of 200 to -- 200 to 300 basis points, right? 
Shanay Shah: Yes. And also, I think the uptick of robotic surgeries in orthopedics has picked up significantly 
across all the group entities. So not only is that contributing, but if you also contribute more 
meaningfully in the quarters to come. 
We have also invested significant capacity in terms of adding 2 more linac bunkers in Surat and 
Ahmedabad in 2 units where we did not have a bunker earlier. And these 2 units will start 
contributing to top line subject to approvals from Q4 onwards. 
So all of these things along with an additional PET/CT scan machine, which will be installed at 
Naroda at some point of time in Ahmedabad in the next quarter or the next fiscal. So we are 
planning a lot of these investments and all of these investments put together will further fuel this 
growth beyond the occupancy going up because of the addition of doctors that Dr. Nishita 
alluded to earlier. 
Kashish Thakur: Understood, sir. Sir, so in light of that, how many da Vinci robotic robots do we have as of now 
in our facility all around? And what kind of capex do we see for FY '26 and '27 like we are 
adding a few of capex-heavy machineries, right? So what kind of capex do we see for these 
years? 
  Shalby Limited

Nishita Shukla: So at present, we have 5 orthopedic robots, and we are in purchase for general surgery, onco 
surgery, neurosurgery robot. So we will be going for SSI Mantra to start with, and then it will 
be da Vinci later on, so as per capex allocation, what we get. 
Shanay Shah: The investments for the radiotherapy machines are already made. And for the orthopedic 
surgeries also, major investments have been made. 
Kashish Thakur: Understood sir. Sir, can you quantify capex, if possible? Or what we are aiming for? 
Amit Kumar: Yes. So the quarter 2 spend has been about INR70 crores. For the first 6 months about we have 
done a INR70 crores of the investment. It largely included the robotic and onco machines for 
about INR50 crores. That was the larger portion. 
Moderator: The next question comes from the line of Naman from AUM Capital. 
Naman: Thanks for the opportunity. I just wanted to understand that on a standalone basis, if you look at 
your MedTech business, despite around 100% growth in your revenues on a Y-o-Y basis, the 
reported EBITDA was negative. So could you please help us understand how should we read 
that? 
Amit Kumar: Deepak, would you like to answer this? 
Deepak Anand: Yes, I can take it part and then you can add up -- my understanding is, can you just repeat the 
question once again? I kind of got the question, but it will be good if you can just repeat it? 
Naman: Yes, sure. Like if you look at your MedTech business on a stand-alone basis, the EBITDA has 
been negative, like despite 100% growth in revenue, like if you could just help us understand 
why this drop in EBITDA for a better understanding? 
Deepak Anand: So it's a function of a couple of things. Number 1 is -- our COGS did go up a little bit high 
because of the dollar fluctuation, okay, between last quarter and this quarter. That's number one. 
Number 2 is also from a mix of products, we did have some extra sales of hits happening which 
-- some product mix, which are lower EBITDA just from a standpoint of capturing the market. 
So these are 2 large contributors for it. 
Naman: And like how should we expect it ahead like in the upcoming quarters? 
Deepak Anand: You're talking about the stand-alone? 
Naman: Yes, yes. The trend in the upcoming quarter.

similar kind -- we are working on certain capacity challenges, which should open up, like I

mentioned, by end of this quarter. So by quarter 4, you will start seeing a good amount of growth 
that will come in place.  
We will also start seeing the EBITDA getting recovered as a part of 2 things. One is on the 
strength of robotics and robotic rentals that are coming through, and also from a standpoint of 
the product mix that we'll focus to sell, which are higher margin ones. So you will see a better 
in quarter coming year for stand-alone. 
Naman: And like -- what exactly led to the rise in our ALOS during the quarter, like on a Y-o-Y basis, it 
stands at INR3.7 crores, growing by approximately 4%. So if you could just help us understand. 
Amit Kumar: Could you clarify your question again? It was -- there was a noise behind it, and we could not 
hear it properly. 
Naman: Yes. So I just wanted to know that what led to the rise in your ALOS during the quarter, like if 
you compare it on a Y-o-Y basis, it has grown up by 4%. So if you could just help us understand. 
Amit Kumar: So it is just that there is a mix change of the specialty, which we have dealt in the period you are 
talking about. It had led to a slight increase in there. 
Naman: And let me ask 1 last question. Does the company have any expansion plan in the northeastern 
region, there has been a lot of expansions going on. So like are you planning to expand your 
presence in the northeastern region? 
Amit Kumar: The answer is no. Not on the cards right now. 
Moderator: The next question comes from the line of Shubham from Purnartha Investment Advisers. 
Shubham: Hi, thanks for the opportunity. I just want to ask about the strategy of ours regarding government 
business because I think so earlier, we have said that we will reduce the government business 
gradually. 
Nishita Shukla: Yes. Hello, sir. I'm Nishita. And regarding government business, if you see all big hospitals and 
the government business has reduced in Surat and all, where we are planning to reduce 
Ayushman and converting it to self-paying and TPA patients. 
The increase of business is only at Mohali unit, if comparatively we see all the hospitals. Mohali 
unit, we have a lot of ECHS patients, and that  is how we are getting the patients more to 
emergencies and all. So we are treating that patient. So as such, the strategy remains same of 
increasing our TPA self-paying work, but at 1 or 2 units, we have allowed them to have and treat 
that patient.

Shanay Shah: I'll just to add. In Mohali, it is very difficult to operate without the without the empowerment of 
ECHS. And similarly, in Jabalpur, a big majority of the patients come from CGHS. So these 2 
cities, we have to take up a lot more government work than we would want to. 
Shubham: So you are saying basically due to Mohali and Gwalior, the government business has increased 
from 23% last year to 27% in current quarter. 
Shanay Shah: The increase is because of Mohali, but most of the government work, significant government 
work is being done in Jabalpur and in Mohali for ECHS and CGHS, respectively. 
Shubham: And that conclude -- that will increase your government business by 4% approximately. 
Shanay Shah: For this quarter, yes, it has increased. Yes. And the fact that what Dr. Nishita alluded to earlier 
on the fact that some of the insurance work was postponed to this quarter because of the ongoing 
negotiations with the insurance company, that has also translated into lesser TPA business, 
which has by default kind of -- because of that reason, you'll see a higher government number 
for this quarter. 
Shubham: And second question on Shalby Inte rnational. Earlier, I think so  you have said that TPAs are 
enrolled -- TPAs are going to be enrolled in Shalby International, so has been TPAs are enrolled 
currently or what's status there? 
Nishita Shukla: Yes, we are in negotiation, like 2 or 3 TPAs  are closed, but we are also waiting for NABH 
accreditation. As per NABH accreditation, our TPA rate negotiations are different. So 
everything has been applied. We are just waiting for the certification of NABH. So once it is 
done, another 4, 5 more TPAs will be on-boarded. 
Shubham: So Shalby International only, our focus is on international business there more or domestic also 
we want to tap up? 
Nishita Shukla: So we will be doing domestic also. So international was already there earlier, but now we are 
also focusing on domestic business. As Dr. Vikram Shah starting his OPD and IP over there, he 
is already receiving a lot of domestic patients. 
Shubham: And on tax rate, what would be the tax rate going forward? 
Amit Kumar: It would be 25%. 
Shubham: From Q3 only, it would be 25% going forward. 
Amit Kumar: So for the year, which is '26 year, which we are underway, the applicable rate would be 25%. 
Moderator: The next question comes from the line of Kashish Thakur from Elara Securities.

Kashish Thakur: Just like -- everyone from the management, I just wanted to dig your brain around or what kind 
of benefit we can get from the CGHS rate revision, which happened earlier this quarter. What 
kind of like growth on top line orders on EBITDA, we can expect from that because as we said 
that we have some -- we have increased our revenue 4% from the Mohali hospital as we have 
undertaken CGHS. So can you just help around that? 
Shanay Shah: Yes. So on the CGHS front, the rate revisions wi ll definitely help us. And we will basically be 
seeing -- we are seeing that the CGHS rates have inched closer to the self-paying rates also. So 
we will start seeing an impact -- we will -- basi cally, at this point of time, we are not able to 
share what is the incremental impact. But yes, there will be a positive impact on the margins and 
a positive impact on the revenues. 
Kashish Thakur: And what -- do we have a positive impact from GST as well? 
Shanay Shah: Yes. There will be a positive impact on GST as well, yes, absolutely. 
Kashish Thakur: Sir, 1 just question on our revenue mix. Still around 34% is driven from ortho-related stuff. Are 
we planning some measures to reduce that? Or is it going to continue in a similar manner? 
Shanay Shah: So we have come to 34% level. And earlier, even if you look at the numbers, 4 quarters earlier 
or 8 quarters earlier, you could see that we were at about 40%, right? So about 10 years ago, this 
number was close to 60%, 70%. And so I think it has drastically come down despite the 
arthroplasty business growing for the group. So the reason is that some of the other specialties 
have picked up faster in some of the new locations where we started. 
So as we speak from the investor presentation also, you could make out that the mix is very well 
diversified between cardiology, neurology, nephro logy, oncology, transplant, critical care. So 
about 10% coming from each of these 10 specialtie s. So now I think from here on, we believe 
that it will further come down arthroplasty business. But be very gradual because arthroplasty 
business will also continue to grow along with some of the other specialties. 
Kashish Thakur: Also, just last on how are FOSO and FOSM business has performed for this quarter? If you can 
quantify, usually, we used to quantify earlier presentation, what has been the performance, and 
if you can quantify that. 
Amit Kumar: Yes. So on to the performance, we are awaiting the outcome to be better off in the coming 
quarters. There are certain measures underway. The performance is -- the results of that is 
expected to come in the coming quarters. 
Moderator: As there are no further questions, I would now like to hand the conference over to management 
for closing comments.
