Chairman’s Message – Strategic Growth & Vision 2028
Dr. Vishnukumar Patel
(Chairman)
“H1 FY26 has demonstrated strong top-line momentum, with consolidated total income 
growing 28.94% to ₹77.71 crore, driven by the continued expansion of our hospitality portfolio 
and consistent performance in our events and advertising businesses. While margins were 
impacted due to higher operating costs at newly launched properties and four seasonal 
properties that remained closed during Q2 FY26 and initial ramp-up expenses related to recent 
expansions; these effects are temporary and inherent to the scale-up phase of new 
destinations. In addition, profitability was affected by the fixed lease commitments payable to 
the Government under the PPP model for our resorts, which continue even during periods of 
lower occupancy in non-season months and for seasonal properties that remained closed 
during Q2 FY26.
With a portfolio of over 825 rooms across 17 operational resorts along with one five-star hotel, 
we are well positioned for sustained operational leverage. As occupancy levels mature and 
efficiencies normalize, we anticipate meaningful improvement in profitability metrics.
The launch of new initiatives, most notably the Praveg Adalaj Theme Park will further 
strengthen our growth trajectory. Our strategy remains firmly focused on disciplined 
expansion, operational excellence, and enhancing our eco-responsible luxury offerings. We 
remain confident in delivering sustainable longterm growth and creating enduring value for 
all stakeholders.”

Praveg At A Glance 
Praveg is a pioneer in eco-responsible luxury hospitality. The Company’s resorts are located in areas of significance from a cultural and heritage point of view and 
places of exotic and natural beauty. The company’s luxury tents allow access to locations, where no traditional construction is possible, which allows tourism to 
flourish while ensuring the preservation of delicate local ecosystems. Due to the premium quality of the company’s tents and the high-end experience, the resorts 
enjoy very high occupancy, strong pre-sales at luxury hotel rates and a high return on capital due to the non-permanent structure of the resort.
Praveg is also a strong player in events due to its roots in event management and expertise in creating large, non-permanent, world-class structures in very short 
periods of time. The Events division has recently diversified into Weddings and Banquets hotels.
