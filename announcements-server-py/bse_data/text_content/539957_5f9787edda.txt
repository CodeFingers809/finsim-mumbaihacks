Dear Sir/ Madam,   
 
Sub.: Regulation 30(10) of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015 – Clarification on Media Reports regarding CNG Supply 
Interruption 
 
Ref:  Media Report  appeared in the “www. moneycontrol.com” dated November 18, 
2025 titled ‘Mumbai CNG crisis: Can city ’s crippled transport system recover by 
Tuesday?’ 
 
This is with reference to your query seeking clarification sought on the recent media reports 
concerning an interruption of CNG supply in the Mumbai region. 
 
In this respect, we would like to submit the following: 
 
Gas pipeline of GAIL (India) Limited (‘GAIL’) was damaged by a third party. The damaged 
pipeline is a feeder pipeline for receiving gas at MGL’s City Gate Station ( ‘CGS’) at Wadala. 
Due to this incident gas supply to CGS at Wadala was interrupted. T his resulted in 
interruption of gas supply to Mumbai city and suburbs. It may be noted that pipeline network 
of Mumbai city and suburbs is inter -connected with other CGS of MGL situated at Mahape, 
Ambernath, Taloja, Usarghar and Savaroli. MGL immediately restored the gas supply to the 
maximum extent possible through other CGS to Mumbai city and suburbs continuously 
throughout this interruption. 
 
Thus, MGL maintained 100% supply to all domestic household consumers and all small / 
medium commercial establishments. Large Industrial customers were asked to stop their 
consumption unless critical. 
 
Since gas supply to Mumbai city and suburbs  was through distant CGSs, to maintain pressure 
at CNG station in whole region it was ensured that all large CNG station s remain operational 
in all pockets of the city. Thus, 60% of the CNG stations  including CNG station at State 
Transport Undertakings were fully operational most of the time in the affected region.

The Company confirms that gas supply by GAIL is fully restored and all operations of MGL 
back to normalcy from afternoon of Tuesday, November 18, 2025. 
 
Given that a majority of MGL’s operations continued without interruption and gas supply 
services remained functional, the materiality thresholds prescribed under Regulation 30 of 
SEBI (L isting Obligations and D isclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 were not 
triggered warranting a disclosure under the captioned regulation. 
 
We trust the above clarifies the matter and adequately addresses your query. 
 
Thanking You, 
 
Yours Sincerely, 
 
For Mahanagar Gas Limited
