India’s power inverter market, valued at USD 6 billion in 2024, is expected to reach USD 22 billion by 2034, growing at a CAGR of 15%. The surge is driven by rising 
demand for backup power, renewable energy adoption, and supportive government policies.. Rising demand for uninterrupted power in industrial, commercial, and 
residential segments. The Indian uninterrupted power supply market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 8% –10% during the forecasted period 2023-28.
Key Growth Drivers:
• Rising Power Reliability Issues: Frequent outages and voltage fluctuations across urban and semi-urban India
• Growth in Data Centers & Critical Infrastructure: Surge in digital services, healthcare, BFSI, telecom, defence, airport, smart cities, etc. 
• Government Incentives & Policy Support: Schemes like MNRE subsidies, net metering, and PLI for battery manufacturing
• Push for Energy Efficiency & Sustainability (ESG): Corporate ESG goals and shift from diesel gensets to clean, efficient alternatives
• Rapid Rooftop Solar Adoption: Strong uptake in residential and C&I rooftop solar drives
• Government Focus: Initiatives like Viability Gap Funding and higher capacity targets aim to strengthen grid stability, boost renewable integration, and cut fossil 
fuel reliance

Industrial Outlook- BESS & Solar EPC 
India’s Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) market is set to grow from under 0.2 GW to 66 GW by 2032. With an 
investment potential of INR 5,000 billion, widespread adoption could avoid over 2,000 million tonnes of CO₂ 
emissions. Valued at USD 7.8 billion in 2024, the market is projected to reach USD 32 billion by 2030, growing at a 
27% CAGR during 2025–30.
Key Drivers
• Renewable Energy Integration- BESS is critical for managing the intermittency of solar and wind power, enabling 
round-the-clock (RTC) clean energy supply and ensuring grid stability.
• Policy Support: The government is boosting BESS adoption through PLI schemes, VGF support, and ISTS charge 
waivers extended till 2028.
• Growing EV Adoption: India’s expanding EV ecosystem is driving demand for BESS to support charging 
infrastructure and manage peak loads.
• Grid Stability: BESS is essential for ancillary services like frequency regulation, voltage support, and peak shaving, 
enhancing overall grid reliability and resilience.
Indian BESS Market
Key Drivers
• Government Push for Renewable Energy: India targets 280 GW renewable energy by 2032, including 81 GW solar, 
supported by solar parks, INR 24,000 Cr PLI, SECI’s solar-battery tenders, and INR 8,580 Cr CPSU EPC projects.
• Rising Demand for Rooftop Solar: Driven by 34% market growth in 2024 and strong ESG commitments, industrial 
and commercial sectors are leading rooftop solar adoption in India.

Operational Highlight
INR 1.53 / Share 
• Revenue for the first half declined due to a high base from a large one-time order in 
H1 FY25, while Q2 revenue grew 20% sequentially on improved execution, although 
overall demand saw short-term deferral following GST recalibration on battery 
categories.
• In the first half, PAT declined due to lower turnover. However, PAT margin improved 
to 8.36% from 7.59% in H1 FY25, supported by better operating efficiency. 
Sequentially, profitability strengthened sharply, with Q2 PAT increasing to INR 83 
million, representing a rise of about 350% over Q1 FY26, which stood at INR 18 
million.
• We secured multiple notable order wins during the quarter, including the 
Maharashtra State Police CCTNS project, a major UPS-rental and transformer order 
from Electronics Payments & Services, and a large BESS project from KPTCL, while 
maintaining strong visibility with bids under evaluation of about INR 8,380 million.
• We continued to strengthen our balance sheet, with long-term debt reducing from 
INR 34 million in March 2025 to INR 10 million in H1 FY26, and short-term debt 
declining sharply from INR 638 million to INR 152 million over the same period, 
resulting in a materially improved net-debt position.
• We also achieved regulatory closure on the customs matter, with the Commissioner 
of Customs issuing a favorable order on 29 July 2025, resulting in the complete 
dropping of the Show Cause Notice and closure of all related proceedings.
• Our expansion remains on track, with the 1.2 GWh Jhajjar BESS facility nearing 
commissioning, SAP B1 and Salesforce implementation underway, the launch of our 
lithium-based BESS for the Commercial and Industrial segment, and plans to 
introduce a full range of Home ESS solutions.
