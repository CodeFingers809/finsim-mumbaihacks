Press Release 
Kotak Mahindra Bank Announces Stock Split on 40th Foundation Day 
Mumbai, November 21, 2025 : Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited (“Kotak” or “the Bank”) today 
announced that its Board of Directors, at a meeting held on the occasion of  the Bank’s 40th 
Foundation Day, approved a sub -division (stock split) of its equity shares, subject to regulatory 
and statutory approvals. 
The Board has approved the sub -division of one existing equity share of the Bank having a face 
value of ₹5/- each, fully paid-up, into equity shares having a face value of ₹  1/-each, fully paid-
up. This move aims to make Kotak’s equity shares more affordable and enhance liquidity, thereby 
encouraging wider market participation, particularly among retail investors. 
C S Rajan, Part-time Chairman, Kotak Mahindra Bank, said: 
"As we celebrate 40 years of our journey, we reaffirm our commitment to creating long -term 
value for our shareholders. This milestone is not just a reflection of our legacy, but a Kotak for 
the future. On this momentous occasion, to encourage wider investor  participation by making 
the Bank’s equity shares more affordable and liquid, the Board has, subject to regulatory and 
statutory approvals, decided to sub-divide the existing equity shares of face value of ₹ 5/-  each 
into equity shares of a smaller denomination of ₹ 1/-  each." 
Ashok Vaswani, Managing Director and CEO, Kotak Mahindra Bank, said: 
"Forty years ago, we began a journey rooted in trust and innovation. Today, as we celebrate this 
remarkable milestone, we also look ahead with a renewed ambition. The decision to implement 
a stock split echoes our commitment to inclusivity, so that more investors can join us in the Kotak 
growth story." 
Consequently, the Board has also approved an amendment to the Capital Clause of the 
Memorandum of Association of the Bank to reflect the revised share structure, post-split. 
These approvals are subject to consent from the Bank’s members, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), 
and other applicable regulatory authorities. The process is expected to be completed within two 
months from receiving all necessary clearances. 
The Bank will share further details, including regulatory updates, on its investor relations website:
