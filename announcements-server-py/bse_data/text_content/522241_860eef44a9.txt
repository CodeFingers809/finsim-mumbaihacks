The global economic landscape remains characterized by ongoing volatility and shifting geopoliticaldynamics. Rising concerns over potential tariff escalations, especially among leading economieshave introduced additional complexity into global supply chains, disrupting the movement of goodsand raw materials across borders.The performance of the Indian automotive industry, particularly on the export front, has softenedduring H1FY26 amid global economic slowdown and macroeconomic headwinds. Escalating tarifftensions, especially involving the United States, have further dampened export momentum,adversely affecting auto component shipments from several countries. Additionally, rising inputcosts, evolving regulatory frameworks, and muted retail sentiment have collectively weighed on thesector’s overall performance.During H1FY26, the Company experienced a modest, market-driven moderation in growth.Nevertheless, our unwavering focus on operational efficiency, innovation, and cost optimizationcontinues to strengthen our long-term growth trajectory. Supported by strong businessfundamentals, the Company remains well-positioned to sustain its resilience and deliver enduringvalue.I herewith present the performance of the Company for the period ended 30 Sept’ 2025.
