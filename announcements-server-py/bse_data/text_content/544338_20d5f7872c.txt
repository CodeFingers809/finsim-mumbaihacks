 Press Release 
Commenting on the performance, Mr. Hare Krishna, Joint CEO of Capital Infra Trust, said: “We are pleased to 
share that the Trust continues to deliver stable operations across all nine HAM assets, with consistent riding quality 
and maintenance standards.  
 
A key development is the successful preferential issue of ~₹ 3,450 million, which has strengthened our balance sheet 
and reduced net debt to 45.6% as of 14th Nov 2025. This capital infusion supports our disciplined leverage strategy 
and positions us well for upcoming asset acquisitions. Additionally, our FY26 growth plan is progressing well, with 
three operational and value-accretive ROFO assets expected to add over ₹ 25,000 million to AUM, taking total AUM 
to more than ~₹68 ,000+ million from the current ₹ 42,820 million and enhancing returns through predictable 
annuity inflows.  The Trust’s fundamentals remain stron g, supported by  a ‘AAA Stable’ CRISIL /CARE rating, and 
leverage ratio within SEBI limits. 
 
In the medium term, we aspire to achieve an AUM of around ₹ 1,00,000 million by FY27E while continuing to deliver 
a consistent DPU to our unitholders.”
