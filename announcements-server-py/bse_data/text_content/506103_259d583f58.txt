Independent Auditor's Review Report on Standalone Un-Audited Financial Results of the 
Company for the Quarter ended September 30, 2025 pursuant to Regulation 33 of the SEBI 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements [LODR]) Regulations, 2015, as amended.  
 
Review Report to 
The Board of Directors of  
VICTORIA ENTERPRISES LIMITED 
 
a.  We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Standalone Unaudited Financial 
Results of VICTORIA ENTERPRISES LIMITED  (the “Company”) for the quarter 
ended September 30, 2025  (“the Statement”) prepared in accordance with the 
recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 
(Interim Financial Reporting ) (“Ind AS 34”), prescribed under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 and relevant rules issued thereunder, and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended, and SEBI 
Circulars issued thereunder. 
 
b.  This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company’s Management and 
approved by the Board of Directors at their meeting held on November 20, 2025 , has 
been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles of Ind 
AS 34 and other applicable accounting standards and policies. The management is 
responsible for the maintenance of adequate accounting records, for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company, and for preventing and detecting fraud and other irregularities. 
 
c.  Our responsibility is to issue a report on the Statement based on our review. We 
conducted our review in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 
2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent 
Auditor of the Entity , issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A 
review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of those 
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other 
review procedures. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance 
with Standards on Auditing and accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.  
 
d.  Basis for Qualified Conclusion: 
We draw attention to the following matters as stated in notes of the financial result for 
the quarter ended 30 
 September 2025: 
 
 Attention is invited to Note 5 of the results wherein 5% Non-Cumulative 
Redeemable Preference Shares issued by the company are due for refund as on 
as on 30th September 2025 (as well as on 31st March 2020, 31st March 2021, 31st 
March 2022, 31st March 2023, 31st March 2024 & 31st March 2025). The 
management is in the process of negotiation with the respective investor to 
restructure the terms of issue of Preference Shares. Hence the same are 
appropriately recognized as Non-Current Liability in the opinion of the Board. 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 Attention is invited to Note 6 of the results wherein, Balance of Receivables and 
Payables, including borrowings taken, loans & advances given, payable to 
vendors, security deposits given, other advances given, other liabilities, advances 
from customers, etc, are subject to confirmation and consequent reconciliation 
and adjustments, if any. Hence, the effect thereof, on Profit/ Loss, Assets and 
Liabilities, if any, is not ascertainable, which may be considerable. The Board of 
the Directors has established a procedure controls to review the reconciliation 
and recoverability of all the assets and payability of all the liabilities, on a regular 
basis, based on the formal/ informal agreements/ arrangements with the 
respective parties involved. As per the opinion of the Board, there will be no 
substantial impact on their reconciliation with their balance confirmations as on 
the reporting date.  
 
 Attention is invited to Note 7 of the results wherein, Balance appearing in the 
financial statements are subject to reconciliation with the returns and 
submissions made with statutory authorities, including GST department. Hence, 
the effect thereof, on Profit/ Loss, Assets and Liabilities, if any, is not 
ascertainable. 
 
 
e.  Qualified Conclusion: 
 
Based on our review, except for the effects/possible effects of the matter described in the 
Basis for Qualified Conclusion  paragraph above, nothing has come to our attention that 
causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the 
recognition and measurement principles laid down in Ind AS 34, prescribed under 
Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and other accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of 
Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be 
disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
