Q2/H1-FY26 Operational Highlights
• Strong Order Book Position: Maintained a robust order book of over INR 50,010 million, providing revenue visibility for the next 24-
36 months. The portfolio remains well-diversified across government infrastructure projects, EPC contracts, and specialized works for 
Public Sector Undertakings, ensuring stability and balanced project exposure.
• Project Execution & Delivery: Sustained an on-time delivery rate of over 90% despite sectoral challenges, reflecting strong 
operational control. Execution activity remained broad-based across multiple states, with continued expansion into high-growth 
regions. Focus on efficient deployment of manpower, machinery, and materials further enhanced productivity and overall cost 
efficiency.
• Financial Discipline & Liquidity Management: Demonstrated strengthened financial discipline with total banking and Non-Banking 
Financial Company exposure reducing to INR 4,880 million as of September 2025 (versus INR 6,480 million in March 2025). Liquidity 
improved meaningfully with continued promoter support through interest-free unsecured loans, rising from INR 600 million in March 
2025 to INR 2,290 million in September 2025. This, along with lower external borrowings, is expected to materially reduce interest 
costs in the coming quarters. Receivable collections improved, aided by significant payment releases from the Rajasthan Government 
in October.
• Business Development: Maintained healthy momentum in business development with over INR 30,000 million worth of tenders 
submitted or under evaluation. Key areas of focus included roads, bridges, urban infrastructure, and renewable-linked construction 
projects, aligned with the Company’s strategic diversification.
• Future Growth Outlook: Well-positioned for sustained growth by leveraging a strong order book to enter new geographies, deepen 
client engagement, and pursue higher-margin segments. A robust pipeline of upcoming bids is expected to translate into order 
inflows in the near term, reinforcing business momentum and long-term expansion prospects.
