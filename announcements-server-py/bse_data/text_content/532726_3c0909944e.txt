reference number Ref. No.: L/SURV/ONL/PV/SK|2O2S-2O261684 requiring us to provide
clarification regarding significant increase in volume of securities of the Company.
ln this regard, we wish to inform you that the Company has made all the necessary disclosures
pursuant to regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations,
