(l) The abovementioned direct and indirect acquisition of shares and voting rights by the Acquirer Trusts in the Target Company would attract the applicability of the provisions of sub-regulation (2) of regulation 3 and regulation 5 read with regulation 4 of the SAST Regulations, 2011. Vide the Application, the Acquirer Trusts have sought exemption from SEBI in respect of the same.   Grounds for seeking exemption -  4. Vide the Application, the Acquirer Trusts have sought the abovementioned exemption, inter-alia, on the following grounds: (a) The proposed acquisitions are pursuant to an estate and succession planning exercise within the family members of Mr. M. P. Ramachandran and Mrs. M. G. Shanthakumari and their immediate relatives. It is intended to efficiently streamline ownership, succession and promote family harmony on a multi-generational basis. The proposed acquisitions would be a non-commercial transaction which would not affect or prejudice the interests of the public shareholders of the Target Company in any manner.  (b) SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2018 (as amended from time to time) as the trustee and ultimate beneficiaries of the Acquirer Trusts are promoters and/ or members of the promoter group of the Target Company. Thus, the proposed acquisitions would not result in any increase / decrease in the holding of the promoters or promoter group of the Target Company. Further, there is no change in control of the Target Company on account of the transfer of shares of SAL (which holds 3.95% shareholding in the Target Company) to the Acquirer Trusts.  (c) The proposed acquisitions of shares by the Acquirer Trusts would also not result in change in control and management of the Target Company. The trustees of the Acquirer Trusts, through whom control would be exercised over the assets of the Acquirer Trusts, are part of the promoter/promoter group of the Target Company as well shareholders of the Target Company. 
 
__________________________________________________________________________________________ Page  of 
(d) There is no effective change in the exercise of voting power or in the control / management of the Target Company. The pre-acquisition shareholding and post-acquisition shareholding of promoter and promoter group in the Target Company would therefore remain same. The change in the identity of persons exercising voting rights over the Target Company would only be between persons, who in their personal capacities, are persons belonging to promoter and promoter group of the Target Company and are the immediate relatives of the person transferring the shares. (e) Trustees are individuals who always represent the trust and all regulations can therefore be enforced on the trustees in their individual capacity. Accordingly, there shall be no difficulty as regards enforceability of the provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 and the regulations framed thereunder if the shares of the Target Company are held by the trustee for the benefit of the beneficiaries. (f) The Acquirer Trusts are private family trusts. The trustee and the ultimate beneficiaries are family members of Mr. M. P. Ramachandran and Mrs. M. G. Shanthakumari and their immediate relatives. The structure in no way results in lack of transparency and does not in any way impact the interest of public shareholders. (g) The transfers of shares to the Acquirer Trusts are for efficient succession planning for the next generation. (h) The Acquirer Trusts have provided undertakings regarding compliance with the criteria stipulated in guidelines stated in Chapter 8 of the Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD-1/P/CIR/2023/31 dated February 16, 2023 (SEBI Master Circular), which contains the following clauses: (i) The Acquirer Trusts are in substance, only a mirror image of the ownership or control of the shares or voting rights in the target company. (ii) Only individual promoters or their immediate relatives or lineal descendants are trustees and beneficiaries of the Acquirer Trusts. 
 
__________________________________________________________________________________________ Page  of 
(iii) The beneficial interest of the beneficiaries of the Acquirer Trusts has not been and will not in the future, be transferred, assigned or encumbered in any manner including by way of pledge/mortgage. (iv) In case of dissolution of the Acquirer Trusts, the assets will be distributed only to the beneficiaries of the trust or to their legal heirs; (v) The Trustees will not be entitled to transfer or delegate any of their powers to any person other than one or more of themselves. (vi) Any change in the trustees/beneficiaries and any change in ownership or control of shares or voting rights held by the Acquirer Trusts shall be disclosed within 2 days to the concerned stock exchanges with a copy endorsed to SEBI for its record. (vii) As far as the provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 and the regulations framed thereunder are concerned, the ownership or control of shares or voting rights will be treated as vesting not only with the trustees but also indirectly with the beneficiaries. (viii) The liabilities and obligations of individual transferors under the SEBI Act, 1992 and the regulations framed thereunder will not change or get diluted due to transfers to the Acquirer Trusts. (ix) The Acquirer Trusts shall confirm, on an annual basis, that they are in compliance with the exemption order passed by SEBI. The said confirmation shall be furnished to the Target Company which it shall disclose prominently as a note to the shareholding pattern filed for the quarter ending March 31 each year, under regulation 31 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015. (x) The Acquirer Trusts shall get their compliance status certified by an independent auditor annually and furnish the certificate to the Stock Exchanges for public disclosure with a copy endorsed to SEBI for its records. (xi) The proposed acquisitions are in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and other applicable laws. 
 
__________________________________________________________________________________________ Page  of 
(xii) The transferors are disclosed as promoters in the shareholding pattern filed with the Stock Exchanges for a period of at least 3 years prior to the proposed acquisition. (xiii) There is no layering in terms of trustees/beneficiaries in the case of the Acquirer Trusts. (xiv) The Trust Deeds do not contain any limitation of liability of the trustees/beneficiaries in relation to the provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 and all regulations framed thereunder. Consideration-  5. I have considered the Application submitted by the Acquirer Trusts and other material available on record. I note that the abovementioned transactions are triggering open offer obligations under sub-regulations (1) and (2) of regulation 3 and regulation 5 read with regulation 4 of the SAST Regulations, 2011. Before I proceed further, I deem it fit to draw reference to the said provisions, which state as under   Substantial acquisition of shares or voting rights.  3(1). No acquirer shall acquire shares or voting rights in a target company which taken together with shares or voting rights, if any, held by him and by persons acting in concert with him in such target company, entitle them to exercise twenty-five per cent or more of the voting rights in such target company unless the acquirer makes a public announcement of an open offer for acquiring shares of such target company in accordance with these regulations.  3(2): No acquirer, who together with persons acting in concert with him, has acquired and holds in accordance with these regulations shares or voting rights in a target company entitling them to exercise twenty-five per cent or more of the voting rights in the target company but less than the maximum permissible non-public shareholding, shall acquire within any financial year additional shares or voting rights in such target company entitling them to exercise more than five per cent of the voting rights, unless the acquirer makes a public announcement of an open offer for acquiring shares of such target company in accordance with these regulations  Acquisition of control  4: Irrespective of acquisition or holding of shares or voting rights in a target company, no acquirer shall acquire, directly or indirectly, control over such target
