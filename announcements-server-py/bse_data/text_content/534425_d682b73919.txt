Board of India (Listing Obligation and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended
To the  Board of Directors of
Speciality Restaurants  Limited
1      We  have  reviewed  the  accompanying  Statement  of  Unaudited  Standalone  Financial  Results  of  Speciality
Restaurallts Limited ("the Company") for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 and year to date from April
01,   2025  to  September  30,  2025  (the  "Statement")  attached  herewith,   belng  submitted   by  the  Company
pursuant  to  the  requ.irements  Of  Regulation  33  of Security  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (Llsting  Obligations
and  D.Isclosure  Requirements)  Regulatlclns,  2015,  as  amended  (the  ''Listlng  Regulations"),  lnclud.Ing  relevant
clrculars  Issued  by the Security and  Exchange Board  of India from time to time.
2      This  Statement,  whlch  is  the  responsib.ility  of the  Company's  Management and  approved  by  the  Company's
Board  of  Dlrectors,  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  recognltion  and  measurement  prlnciples  laid
down  ln  the  lndlan  Accountlng  Standards  34  "lnterlm  Financial  Reporting"  ("Ind  AS  34"),   prescribed  under
sectlcln  133  of the  Companies Act,  2013  as  amended,  read  with  relevant  rules  Issued  thereunder and  other
accounting   principles   generally   accepted   in   India   and   ln   compliance   with   Regulation   33   of   the   Llsting
Regulatlons   Our responslbility  is to express a concluslon  on the Statement based  on  our review
3      We conducted  our review of the  Statement in  accordance with  the  Standartl  on  Review  Engagement (SRE)
2410,  "Review  of  lnterirn  Flnanclal  lnformatlon  Performed  by  the  Independent Auditor of the  Entlty",  Issued
by the  lnstltute of Chartered Accountants of India  (lcAl),  This standard  requires that we plan  and  perform the
revlew to obtain  moderate  assurance  as to whether the  Statement  ls free of material  misstatement.  A  review
of interim financial  information  conslsts of maklng  inqulrles,  primarily  of persons  responsible for financial and
accounting  matters,  and  applying  analytlcal  and  other  review  procedures.  A  review  is  substantially  less  in
scope than  an  audit conducted  ln  accordance with  Standards on  Auditing  specified  under section  143(10)  of
the Companles Act,  2013 and  consequently does  not enable us to  obtain assurance that we would  become
aware  of aH  slgn.ificant  matters  that  mlght  be  identifled  ln  an  audit   Accordlngly,  we  do  riot express  an  audit
Opinion.
4.     Based  on  our  revlew  conducted  as  stated  .In  paragraph  3  above,   nothing  has  come  to  our  attent.Ion  that
causes   us   to   believe   that  the   accompanying   Statement   prepared   in   accordance   with   the   applicable
acoounting   standards   (`IND   AS')   prescribed   under  sectlon   133   of  the  Companies  Act,   2013,   read   with
relevant  rules  issued  there  under  and  other  recognized  accounting  practices  and  policies  has  not  disclosed
the  informatlon  requlred  to  be  disclosed   in  terms  of  Regulation  33  of  the  SEBI   (listing  Obligations  and
Disclosure   Requirements)   Regulations,   2015   as   amended,   including   the   manner   ln   whlch   it   is   to   be
disclosed,  or that it contains any material  mis-statement.
