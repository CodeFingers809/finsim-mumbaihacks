arrangements, and gunmen have also been deployed. The RP stated that it cannot be conclusively

that the details of the deployed security personnel have already been mentioned in the notice. With

The RP further apprised the Committee that the engagement of consultants was carried out after 
consultation with the Successful Resolution Applicant (SRA), Krish Infrastructure Private Limited, 
to ensure adherence to all procedural, and regulatory requirements in relation to the DTCP approval 
and for the reason that the said funds have been provided by SRA , being part of Interim Finance , 
in accordance with the terms of approved resolution plan. The consultants facilitated coordination 
with DTCP authorities, assisted in preparation and submission of required documentation and 
ensured timely receipt of approval, necessary for continuation of the project.

engaged by the SRA be provided. The RP clarified that the consultants are licensed professionals 
of the DTCP and undertake various categories of work. They were engaged based on the specific 
requirements at the relevant time. The RP further stated that brief details of their scope of work will

ANY OTHER MATTER: 
AGENDA ITEM NO. 44.10 
TO DISCUSS & SEEK APPROVAL OF EXCLUSION OF CIRP PERIOD ELAPSED SINCE 
THE FILING OF RESOLUTION PLAN APPLICATION AND FURTHER EXTENSION OF 
CIRP PERIOD BY 60 DAYS OF CIRP PERIOD AND TO AUTHORIZE THE 
RESOLUTION PROFESSIONAL TO MOVE APPLICATION(S) BEFORE HON’BLE 
NCLT, NEW DELHI BENCH SEEKING EXCLUSION AND EXTENSION OF CIRP 
PERIOD 
The Chairman apprised the Committee of Creditors that the application for approval of the 
Resolution Plan was listed for hearing on 17.11.2025. After hearing the applications objecting the 
resolution plan, the Hon’ble NCLT directed that the Resolution Plan be remitted back to the CoC, 
for reconsideration, in accordance with judicial precedents. The RP further apprised the CoC that 
the copy of order dated 17.11.2025 has not yet been uploaded on the official website of NCLT. 
Since the order was dictated in the open court, the RP placed the agenda for the consideration and 
approval of COC. 
The RP further apprised the CoC that the extended CIRP period was expired on 14.06.2024 and the 
application for the approval of the Resolution Plan had already been submitted before the Hon’ble 
16
 
 
NCLT within the extended timeline. Accordingly, no further extension of the CIRP period was 
required at that stage. However, in light of the recent directions of the Hon’ble NCLT to reconsider 
the Resolution Plan, a further extension of 60 days from the date of the order is required, to enable 
detailed deliberations and to facilitate the reconsideration of the Resolution Plan in compliance with 
the Hon’ble NCLT’s directions. 
The RP further apprised the CoC that there is a requirement for exclusion of the CIRP period from 
14.06.2024 (the last date of the extended CIRP period) until the application seeking further 
extension of the CIRP period is allowed by the Hon’ble NCLT. 
Accordingly, in due compliance of the directions issued by the Hon’ble NCLT, the RP shall file an 
application with Hon’ble NCLT , wherein , the exclusion of the period from 14.06.2024 until the 
disposal of the extension application shall be prayed for, along with a further extension of CIRP 
Period by 60 days from the date of the order, to allow sufficient time for receipt of revised resolution 
plan, deliberations on the same, further modifications and placing the modified resolution plan on 
voting and subsequently filing an application with the Hon’ble NCLT for approval of revised 
resolution plan. 
Accordingly, after due deliberations upon the agenda, it was decided that the following resolutions 
shall be put for seeking approval of the COC members through e-voting: 
Resolution: 
To consider and, if thought fit, to pass with or without modification the following resolution- 
“RESOLVED THAT the CoC hereby approves to file an exclusion application before the Hon’ble NCLT 
seeking exclusion of the intervening period from the last date of extended CIRP period i.e., 
14.06.2025 till the disposal of the extension application; 
RESOLVED FURTHER THAT pursuant to Section 12 (3) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy 
Code, 2016 read with regulation 40 of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency 
Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016, the COC be and hereby approved the 
extension of CIRP period for a period of sixty (60) days from the date of order of Hon’ble NCLT 
extending the CIRP; 
RESOLVED FURTHER THAT, Mr. Jalesh Kumar Grover, Resolution Professional is hereby 
authorized to move appropriate applications under Section 12(3) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy 
Code, 2016, and other applicable provisions, before the Hon’ble NCLT, New Delhi Bench, seeking 
exclusion of the intervening period from the last date of extended CIRP period i.e., 14.06.2025 till 
17
 
 
the disposal of the extension application and further extension period of sixty (60) days from the 
date of order.”  
 
Further, the Chairman invited the Homebuyers, who were attending the meeting virtually, to share 
their queries one by one. A brief record of the discussions held with the Homebuyers is as 
mentioned below: 
The AR raised a query stating that, three meetings has been attended by her in the capacity of AR, 
and as per Regulation 16A of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, attendance for two meetings 
stands automatically ratified. Further, the AR requested that this agenda shall also be placed for 
voting. The RP clarified that the same shall be part of the CIRP Expenses Ratification Agenda. 
S. No. Homebuyer Queries Responses 
1.  One of the homebuyers raised a query 
stating that a physical meeting was held 
2–3 days ago with the RP and the SRA, 
and that the said meeting now appears 
to have been dispensed with and no 
action is proposed to be taken pursuant 
to it. The homebuyer sought 
clarification regarding the reason for 
the same. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It was further queried that, as discussed 
in the earlier meeting, Krish had been 
informed that efforts would be made to 
bring their proposal at par with 
The RP clarified that the meeting was not 
dispensed with but was duly conducted. 
During the meeting, it was proposed that a 
committee would be constituted to compare 
the plans of Samyak and Krish, as requested 
by some HBs. However, this is no longer 
required at present, as the resolution plan of 
Krish has been sent back by the Hon’ble 
NCLT. The RP stated that once the revised 
plan or addendum is received, discussions 
on revised proposal will be undertaken. If 
all challenges are addressed satisfactorily, a 
comparison shall be prepared with the 
earlier resolution plan of Krish and the same 
shall be presented to the committee.  
 
The RP clarified that since the Hon’ble 
NCLT has reminded back the plan and all 
objections raised in respect of the plan are 
now required to be addressed by the SRA. 
18
 
 
Samyak’s plan. Clarification was 
sought as to whether this process would 
still continue. 
Once the SRA incorporates the necessary 
corrections, the RP will examine whether 
all challenges and objections have been 
duly resolved. 
 
2.  One of the homebuyers asked, is there 
any timeline for the Krish to submit the 
revised proposal? 
 
 
 
 
 
A query was raised as to whether, if the 
SRA does not submit the revised 
proposal within one week, there is a 
possibility that the hearing scheduled 
for 28.11.2025 may get delayed. 
The RP clarified that Krish has been 
requested to submit the revised proposal 
within one week. The RP further informed 
that an extension of 60 days will be 
required, for which the CoC’s approval will 
be sought in the present meeting. Upon 
approval, an application for extension will 
be filed before the Hon’ble NCLT. The 
intention is to have the application listed on 
28.11.2025. 
 
 
The RP clarified that the hearing on 
28.11.2025 is already fixed and is 
independent of the submission of the 
revised Resolution Plan. He further clarified 
that the hearing scheduled for 28.11.2025 
pertains to other matters and will not be 
affected by the SRA’s timeline for 
submitting the revised proposal. 
3.  One of the homebuyers sought update 
on the retrofitting. 
 
 
 
The RP clarified that the report on 
retrofitting has already been received, along 
with the estimated expenses. RP further 
informed that the retrofitting work will 
commence once fit out work/construction 
activity at the site begins. 
 
 
19
 
 
A query was raised as to whether any 
penalty has been imposed on the 
previous security agency. 
 
 
 
A query was raised regarding the 
consequences in the event Samyak 
repeats a similar incident with the 
newly appointed security agency. Then 
any action against Security agency will 
be taken? 
 
Is bouncers of Samyak from the site has 
been removed?  
The RP responded that the earlier security 
agency has already been replaced. It was 
further clarified that no penalty can be 
imposed on the previous agency, as 
apparently, there was no fault on the part of 
security guards. 
 
 
The RP replied that the newly appointed 
security agency is more competent 
compared to the earlier one. It was further 
stated that every security agency functions 
in accordance with its own operational 
capacity and protocols. The RP expressed 
his view that no such incident is expected to 
be repeated by Samyak in this regard. 
 
The RP clarified that there are no bouncers 
at the site; however, three security guards 
have been deployed by Samyak Projects 
Private Limited. 
 
4.  A query was raised regarding whether 
the internal retrofitting work can be 
commenced at the site. 
The RP clarified that the Hon’ble NCLT has 
remanded the Resolution Plan back to the 
CoC and the only matters presently pending 
before the NCLT are the applications filed 
by or against Samyak, to ensure that 
Samyak does not cause any disruption at the 
site. 
The RP further informed that internal 
retrofitting work cannot commence at this 
stage, as the inventory process is still 
underway. Once the inventory is completed, 
the next step will be preparation of the 
20
 
 
budget. In the meantime, the RP is making 
efforts to obtain order from the Hon’ble 
NCLT. 
5.  One of the homebuyers raised a query 
as to whether, since the plan has been 
remanded back, it can now be 
compared with other plans, and 
whether the other Resolution 
Applicants would be involved in this 
process. 
 
The homebuyers sought update on 
another project of Krish. 
The RP clarified that since the plan has been 
remanded back by the Hon’ble NCLT, it has 
been remanded solely for the purpose of 
addressing and rectifying the objections 
raised. No fresh or additional process can be 
initiated. 
 
 
The RP stated that a brief note on the other 
projects of Krish will be presented. He 
further informed that the relevant details 
will be obtained from Krish to ensure that 
there is no inconsistency in the information 
provided. 
6.  A request was made to initiate a 
settlement with Samyak, being the 
landowner, prior to the submission of 
the revised Resolution Plan, so that the 
issue does not continue to linger any 
further. 
It was suggested that any liability 
arising in this regard should be 
expressly stated to be the sole 
responsibility of the SRA. 
The RP stated that the matter has already 
been communicated to the SRA, and 
discussions in this regard are ongoing. 
 
7.  Whether Homebuyers who have paid 
less than 35% of the consideration, and 
to whom no legal notice has been 
issued by Ansal, are eligible to submit 
their claims? 
The RP clarified that, although several 
judgments exist on this issue, the legal 
position is not yet conclusively settled. 
Further, reference was made to a published 
legal article which states that the 
21
 
 
Information Memorandum, prepared by the 
RP shall include the details of all allottees, 
including their names, amounts due, and 
units allotted, as reflected in the corporate 
debtor’s records, irrespective of whether 
such allottees have filed claims; and  
the resolution plan shall provide for 
treatment of such allottees.  
 
 
 
8.  Tower-wise fit out work was 
previously underway. Kindly clarify 
the current status of the construction in 
this regard. 
A request was made by the 
Homebuyers to the Resolution 
Applicant to consider initiating 
construction of the towers that have not 
yet commenced, Parallelly with the 
ongoing towers, so that the overall 
progress of the project may be 
expedited. 
The RP stated that the construction 
activities have been temporarily put on 
hold. The matter will be reconsidered once 
the Modified Resolution Plan is received. 
The RP replied that, as a matter of practical 
approach, the Resolution Applicant is 
expected to prioritize completion of the 
towers where construction has already 
commenced. However, the Resolution 
Applicant has, proposed in the previous 
plan that Homebuyers of non-constructed 
towers may switch their units in the towers 
that are nearing completion or have been 
completed. The request of the HBs shall be 
duly conveyed to the SRA. 
9.  The Hon’ble NCLT has observed that 
all transactions pertaining to non-
claimants are required to be verified, as 
this responsibility lies with both the 
Resolution Applicant and the 
Resolution Professional. In this regard, 
kindly clarify the criteria and 
RP replied that all data pertaining to belated 
claimants and non-claimants will be 
forwarded to the SRA, with directions to 
appropriately address these categories in the 
Modified Resolution Plan. 
 
 
 
22
 
 
parameters that will be applied for such 
verification. 
Kindly clarify the matters, which will 
be taken up on the next date of hearing 
scheduled for 28.11.2025. 
Additionally, please confirm whether 
the application relating to the 
Resolution Plan may also be heard on 
that date. 
 
 
 
The RP clarified that the Resolution Plan 
will not be taken up for hearing on that date. 
The application against Samyak, along with 
other pending applications, is scheduled to 
be heard on 28.11.2025. 
Further, the application seeking extension 
of CIRP Period to be filed before NCLT 
may also be heard on that day. 
10.  A request has been placed that the 
payments made by Homebuyers in 
excess of 100% of the sale 
consideration be duly adjusted towards 
the advance amount payable at the time 
of registration, and that the same be 
expressly incorporated in the Modified 
Resolution Plan. 
The RP acknowledged the request and 
noted the same for appropriate 
consideration. 
11.  During the last physical meeting, 
discussions were held on the formation 
of a committee. What was the primary 
objective of constituting this 
committee? Was it to review both the 
plans in detail and to prepare a 
comparative assessment to facilitate 
informed decision-making? 
The RP clarified that in view of the plan 
having been remanded back, the intention is 
to resolve and remove all objections raised 
in respect of the plan. Therefore, if deemed 
necessary, a committee shall be formed 
after the hearing scheduled on 28.11.2025, 
subject to legal view, in this regard. 
 
Thereafter, AR Ms. Akriti, aligning with the 
RP’s submission, stated that the meeting 
under reference was conducted before 
17.11.2025, the date on which the hearing 
was held. Consequently, at that stage, 
neither the RP nor the AR was in a position 
to compare the plans. AR added that, given 
23
 
 
the changed circumstances and the remand 
back of the plan, a comparative discussion 
on previous proposal & revised proposal 
may now be undertaken. 
12.  One of the homebuyers raised query 
regarding whether the remand back of 
the plan implies that a completely new 
plan is required to be submitted, or 
whether filing an addendum to the 
existing plan would suffice. 
The RP clarified that, it is upon the SRA to 
decide whether a fresh plan is to be 
submitted or an addendum would suffice. 
The RP further stated that, for the time 
being, we can only wait for their revised 
proposal. 
13.  Further, a question was raised as to 
whether the plans submitted by other 
applicants can also be assessed and 
examined. 
 
 
One of the homebuyers raised a query 
regarding the appropriate steps to be 
taken in the event the plan under 
consideration is deemed unsuitable or 
not in the best interest of the 
stakeholders. 
The RP responded that the plans submitted 
by others cannot be taken into consideration 
unless a fresh Form G is issued. 
 
 
 
 
The RP clarified that the appropriate course 
of action can be determined only after the 
revised proposal is submitted. Once the 
same is received, it will be reviewed and 
deliberated upon. 
14.  In view of the information that the 
Hon’ble NCLT has remanded the plan 
back for the purpose of considering all 
objects, a request was made to clarify 
and elaborate on the objections or 
issues identified by the Hon’ble Bench. 
 
 
 
 
 
The RP clarified that the primary objections 
relate to late claims, escalation concerns, 
and one other application wherein the 
applicant (Homebuyer) seeking directions 
to consider his claim as allottee and admit 
the claim as financial creditor in class, as his 
claim has been admitted as unsecured 
financial creditor. 
 
 
 
24
 
 
In view of the Hon’ble NCLT’s 
direction to rectify all discrepancies, a 
query was raised regarding whether the 
said direction is beneficial or adverse in 
the present circumstances. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
One of the homebuyers raised a query 
regarding the proposal of the plan, as 
the RP earlier stated that, at the time the 
plan was earlier put to vote, he had 
informed the CoC about several 
discrepancies and concerns within the 
plan. However, notwithstanding those 
observations, the plan was ultimately 
approved by the CoC. 
 
 
The RP clarified that since the Resolution 
professional is the officer of Court means 
appointed by the Hon’ble NCLT. 
Therefore, the RP, is bound to comply with 
its directions and cannot take any position 
in opposition to the Tribunal’ orders. 
Nonetheless, he noted that the SRA or the 
CoC are at liberty to challenge the said 
decision, if they consider it necessary. 
 
AR Ms. Aakriti Sood additionally stated 
that the right of each homebuyer is to 
receive their flat remains intact, irrespective 
of whether their claims were submitted 
belatedly. AR further highlighted that the 
recent changes and clarifications in the legal 
position have a bearing on such matters, and 
accordingly, the Hon’ble NCLT has 
remanded the plan with the objective of 
rectifying and addressing these issues 
comprehensively. 
 
 
The RP clarified that the plan was legally 
compliant. The concerns raised have 
already been taken on record, and the RP 
assured that all issues pertaining to the 
homebuyers, as well as the Samyak matter, 
will be duly addressed in the revised 
proposal to facilitate the speedy approval of 
the plan. The RP further stated that if any 
aspect remains unaddressed in the plan, the 
same will be placed before the CoC in its 
meeting. 
25
 
 
 
 
In continuation of Ms. Aakriti’s 
statement that the Hon’ble NCLT has 
merely remanded the plan and has not 
directed the issuance of Form G for 
inviting any fresh plans, a question was 
put forth on whether the RP is 
empowered to propose that the 
Resolution Plan be reworked with zero 
escalation charges. 
 
 
The RP reiterated that the revised plan shall 
first be placed in  the CoC. If it is observed 
that the plan is not feasible or does not meet 
the required parameters, further 
deliberations may be undertaken to explore 
other available courses of action. He 
emphasized that the CoC has full authority 
to evaluate and decide upon all possible 
alternatives. 
15.  In light of the Hon’ble NCLT’s 
decision to remand back the CoC 
approved Resolution Plan, clarification 
was sought on the precise objections 
identified by the Bench. A specific 
query was also raised as to whether any 
remark, observation, or objection 
relating to Samyak formed part of the 
issues pointed out by the Hon’ble 
Tribunal. 
 
The RP clarified that the Hon’ble NCLT has 
stated that all the objections to the 
resolution plan , by the homebuyers’ be 
dismissed. He further stated that the 
application pertaining to Samyak has not 
yet been decided and remains pending 
before the Hon’ble Tribunal. 
 
 
 
 
16.  One of the homebuyers raised a query 
as to whether the SRA had attended the 
meeting or if any communication had 
been issued to them in this regard. 
 
 
 
 
 
One of the homebuyers raised query as 
to whether the Hon’ble NCLT has 
specifically directed or indicated that 
The RP clarified that the SRA does not 
participate in CoC meetings as they are not 
members of the Committee. The RP added 
that the counsel of the SRA was present 
before the Hon’ble NCLT during the 
hearing, and, having agreed with the 
observations of the Bench, the plan was 
thereafter remitted for necessary action. 
 
The RP replied that the Hon’ble Bench had 
observed that several objections had been 
raised in respect of the plan and asked what 
26
 
 
escalation charges are not to be 
imposed. 
 
solution the SRA was proposing. In 
response, the counsel for the SRA stated 
that they would endeavour to address and 
remove all objections, if the plan is 
remanded back. 
 
17.  One of the homebuyers raised a query 
regarding the next scheduled date for 
submission of the revised plan. 
The RP clarified that no specific date has 
been fixed for submission of the plan. He 
further stated that an extension will first be 
sought, following which appropriate 
timelines may be determined. 
18.  Reference was made to the RP’s earlier 
statement that, in the event the Hon’ble 
NCLT directs the admission of belated 
claims, the SRA may opt to challenge 
the order. Accordingly, clarification 
was sought on whether the RP has 
followed up with the SRA on this 
potential course of action. 
 
One of the homebuyers raised query 
regarding the purpose of the hearing 
listed for 28.11.2025, and whether 
substantive arguments are expected to 
be heard on that date. 
The RP explained that the plan was 
remanded back by the Hon’ble NCLT with 
the consent of the SRA, and therefore, in 
light of their concurrence before the Bench, 
the SRA does not have the scope to file an 
appeal against the said order. 
 
 
 
The RP clarified that the primary purpose of 
the hearing on 28.11.2025 is to address the 
application moved against Samyak, 
wherein a request has been made to restrain 
them from undertaking construction 
activities. 
19.  One of the homebuyers raised query 
regarding who will address and resolve 
the issues concerning Samyak, and 
whether this responsibility lies with the 
SRA or with the homebuyers. 
The RP explained that the responsibility of 
resolving the Samyak-related issues rests 
with the SRA, and the same is expected to 
be incorporated and settled within the 
revised proposal. Once the revised proposal 
is received, the RP will evaluate the 
situation and decide whether any further 
intervention is required. 
27
 
 
20.  A query was raised as to whether it is 
required to deploy gunmen at the 
project site for safety or compliance 
purposes. 
 
 
 
We came across a statement that, in real 
estate insolvency cases, no homebuyer 
has been able to obtain possession of 
their house. We would like to confirm 
whether this is correct. 
The RP explained that ensuring the security 
of the property forms part of his statutory 
responsibilities. Accordingly, the 
deployment of gunmen at the project site 
has been made to ensure adequate 
protection of the site. 
 
The RP clarified that they are presently 
handling several other real estate matters, 
and in four of such cases, the homebuyers 
have already received possession of their 
residential units. 
21.  It was requested that the Resolution 
Professional consider facilitating a 
deliberation between the homebuyer 
group, both those in favour of and those 
opposed to the claims pertaining to 
Samyak, with a view to achieving an 
amicable and mutually acceptable 
resolution of the matter. 
The RP clarified that once the revised 
proposal is received, it will be examined, 
and thereafter the appropriate further steps 
required from the RP’s end will be taken 
accordingly. 
22.  Can we explore other means? The RP explained that the plan of SRA has 
been remanded back for reconsideration of 
COC, in accordance with judicial 
precedents. It is advisable that the COC 
first look at the plan and then discuss 
further. 
 
23.  Whether a meeting with Samyak can be 
convened for further clarity and 
discussion on the issues involved? 
The RP clarified that the Homebuyers’ 
Committee, which was formed earlier, 
may meet with Samyak for the purpose of 
negotiation. However, Samyak cannot be 
formally invited or allowed to participate 
in the CoC meeting.

Thereafter, the AR raised a query as to whether Section 29A due diligence is required to be 
undertaken again, considering that the Resolution Plan had been approved through e-voting on

done, in this regard.  
 
The Committee took note of the same.
