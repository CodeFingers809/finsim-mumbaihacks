Independent Auditors' Review Report on unaudited financial results for the quarter and half 
year ended 30 September 2025 of Utkarsh Small Finance Bank Limited pursuant to the 
Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63(2) of the Securities and Exchange Board 
of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended. 
To 
The Board of Directors of 
Utkarsh Small Finance Bank Limited 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results of Utkarsh Small 
Finance Bank Limited ('the Bank') for the quarter and half year ended 30 September 2025 ('the 
Statement'), being submitted by the Bank pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 and 
Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63(2) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended ('the Listing 
Regulations '). We have initialled the Statement for identification purpose only. 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Bank's Management and approved by the Board 
of Directors of the Bank, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement 
principles laid down in the Accounting Standard 25 'Interim Financial Reporting'(' AS 25') , 
prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, read with relevant rules issued 
thereunder, in so far as they apply to Banks , the relevant provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, 
1949, the circulars, guidelines and directions issued by the Reserve Bank oflndia (the 'RBI') from 
time to time (the 'RBI Guidelines ') and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
and in compliance with Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63(2) of the Listing 
Regulations. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (' SRE') 2410, 
"Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity" 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and 
perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the Statement is free of material 
misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of the Bank's personnel and analytical 
procedures applied to financial data and thus provides less assurance than an audit. We have not 
performed an audit and accordingly , we do not express an audit opinion. 
4. Based on our review conducted as stated in paragraph 3 above, nothing has come to our attention 
that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the 
recognition and measurement principles laid down in AS 25 prescribed under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013, read with relevant rules thereunder, the RBI Guidelines and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India and has not disclosed the infonnation required 
to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 read with Regulation 63(2) of the 
Listing Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any 
material misstatement or that it has not been prepared in accordance with the relevant prudential

norms issued by the RBI in respect of income recognition, asset classification, provisioning and 
other related matters. 
5. The unaudited financial results of the Bank for the corresponding quarter ended 30 September 2024 
and for the quarter ended 30 June 2025 were reviewed by earlier auditors whose reports dated 09 
November 2024 and 02 August 2025 respectively expressed an unmodified conclusion on those 
financial results and for the corresponding half year ended 30 September 2024 and the financial 
results of the Bank for the year ended 31 March 2025 were audited by earlier auditors whose report 
dated 09 November 2024 and 03 May 2025, respectively, expressed an unmodified opinion on 
those financial results. Our conclusion is not modified in respect of these matters.
