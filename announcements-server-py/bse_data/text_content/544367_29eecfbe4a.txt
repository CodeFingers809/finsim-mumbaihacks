Quality Power Group Strengthens Market Position as Mehru Secures 
₹26 Crore High-Voltage Instrument Transformers Order 
New order reflects strong customer confidence in Quality Power’s technical expertise and 
execution capability 
Sangli, 21 November 2025 :: MEHRU Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Private Limited 
(“MEHRU”), a material subsidiary of Quality Power Electrical Equipments Limited (QPEEL), has 
secured a major order valued at approximately ₹26 Crores, the largest single order for the 
supply of 400kV and 220kV Oil-Cooled Current Transformers (CTs).  
This order from Powergrid Corporation of India Ltd strengthens Mehru’s longstanding 
leadership in the high-voltage instrument transformer segment, particularly in the 132kV – 
500kV range. The scope includes the manufacturing and delivery of oil cooled instrument 
transformers that play a critical role in high voltage substations applications, reinforcing the 
company’s strong presence in India’s transmission infrastructure market. 
 Mr. Sanjog Mhatre, Chief Business Officer, Quality Power Electrical Equipments Ltd., said, 
“This is the single largest order for instrument transformer product line and is an important 
milestone for us and demonstrates the growing strength of our group companies across the 
power transmission value chain. This win reinforces our strong positioning in India’s expanding 
grid infrastructure. With increasing investments in transmission capacity and renewable energy 
integration, we anticipate sustained opportunities for the group across high-voltage 
components, including instrument transformers, reactors, and power quality systems.” 
The execution of this order is planned over a 12-month timeline, with revenue recognition 
expected to commence from Q4 FY 2025–26. Mehru will be able to deliver the order through 
its existing manufacturing facility in Bhiwadi (National Capital Region). This reflects the 
company’s operational scalability and supports QPEEL’s financial visibility for the coming fiscal 
period, while reinforcing the Group’s ability to efficiently manage large, complex transmission 
equipment orders. 
Further this order aligns closely with Quality Power’s strategy of expanding its domestic market 
presence while leveraging operational synergies across its subsidiary companies. Mehru’s 
continued success in securing high-value orders underscores the Group’s growing strength in 
the transmission equipment segment and supports its broader growth trajectory as India 
accelerates grid expansion and renewable energy integration.
