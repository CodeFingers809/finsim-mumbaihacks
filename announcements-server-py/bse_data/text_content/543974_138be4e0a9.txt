Prakash R Punglia Limited for the quarter ended 30 September 2025 and year to date 
results for the period from 1% April 2025 to 30" September 2025 pursuant to 
Regulation 33 of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended 
To 
The Board of Directors 
Vishnu Prakash R Punglia Limited 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of unaudited financial results of Vishnu 
Prakash R Punglia Limited for the quarter ended 30" September, 2025 and year to date 
results for the period from 1% April 2025 to 30" September 2025 (‘the Statement’) 
attached herewith, which includes 18 jointly controlled operations incorporated on a 
proportionate basis, being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of 
Regulation 33 of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended. 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's management and approved by 
its Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial 
Reporting” (‘Ind AS 34), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and 
other accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 
33 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (“Listing Regulations"). Our responsibility is 
to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries. primarily of 
persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. and applying analytical and other 
review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in 
accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain 
assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified 
in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
4. We did not review the interim financial information of 18 jointly controlled operations 
included in the Statement, whose financial information reflect total assets of Rs.1376.40 
million as at 30" September 2025, total revenues of Rs.194.48 million and Rs. 642.33 million, 
total net profit/(loss) after tax of Rs. 0.26 million and Rs. 0.55 million and’tot?l =

comprehensive income of Nil for the quarter ended 30" September 2025 and for the period 
from 15t April 2025 to 30 September 2025 respectively, net cash outflow of Rs.46.55 million 
for the period 1% April 2025 to 30" September 2025, as included in the Statement. The 
interim financial information of these jointly controlled operations have been reviewed by 
the other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us, and our conclusion in so far as 
it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of these jointly controlled 
operations, is based solely on the report of such other auditors and the procedures 
performed by us. 
Our conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter. 
Note no. 7 regarding not incorporating financial results of 1 joint operation in the statement 
on account of financial data not shared by the respective joint venture partner. Our 
conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter. 
5. Based on our review conducted as stated in paragraph 3 above and based on the 
consideration of the review reports of other auditors referred to in paragraph 4 above, 
nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying 
Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid 
down in Ind AS 34 and other recognised accounting principles generally accepted in India, 
has not disclosed the information as required to be disclosed in terms of the Regulations, 
including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material 
misstatement.
