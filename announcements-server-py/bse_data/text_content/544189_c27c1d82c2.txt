Subject: Corrigendum to the Notice of Extra Ordinary General Meeting (“EGM”)  
dated November 06, 2025 
Ref: Scrip Code: - 544189 – SATTRIX INFROMATION SECURITY LIMITED 
 
Dear Sir/Madam, 
 
In continuation to our earlier letter dated November 06, 2025, enclosing the notice of the EGM dated 
November 06, 2025, we are now submitting a Corrigendum to the EGM Notice of the Company. 
 
This Corrigendum is being issued by way of clarification and is intended to form an integral part of 
the EGM Notice. You are requested to read the EGM Notice in conjunction with this Corrigendum. All 
other contents of the EGM Notice save and except as clarified, modified or supplemented by this 
Corrigendum, shall remain unchanged. 
 
The Corrigendum is dispatched to the Members by electronic means on the email addresses 
registered with the Depository Participant(s) /Company /the Registrar and Share Transfer Agents of 
the Company. 
 
The reason for issuing corrigendum is: 
 
a. One of the allottees was holding 63,000 equity shares of the Company, comprising 55,000 shares 
in a demat account maintained with a Depository Participant of Central Depository Services 
(India) Limited (“CDSL”) and 8,000 shares in another demat account mai ntained with a 
Depository Participant of National Securities Depository Limited (“NSDL”). At the time of 
implementing the lock-in, only the 55,000 shares held in the CDSL -linked demat account were 
locked-in, whereas the 8,000 shares held in the NSDL-linked demat account were inadvertently 
omitted to be considered. Upon identification of this discrepancy, the Company has undertaken 
the lock-in of the remaining 8,000 shares on November 18, 2025. 
 
The said allottee has not transferred, sold, or otherwise disposed off any of the aforesaid shares 
during the period of six months preceding the relevant date and up to the date of issuance of this 
corrigendum. The Company expresses sincere regret for the inadvertent omission and assures that 
the oversight has been fully and appropriately rectified. 
 
b. Further, a disclosure regarding requirement of Shareholders’ approval was omitted to be 
inserted in the notice. The same has now been duly rectified. 
 
 
 
This may be treated as a disclosure under Regulation 30 and other applicable provisions of SEBI 
(Listing Obligation and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended. 
 
This is for your information and records. 
 
Please take note of the same. 
 
Yours faithfully, 
 
For Sattrix Information Security Limited, 
(formerly known as Sattrix Information Security Private Limited)
