National Company Law Tribunal, Delhi (“NCLT”) Order dated 25th November 2022, 
and Mr. Brijesh Singh Bhadauriya having registration number IBBI/IPA -002/IP- 
N01045/2020-2021/13385 was appointed as the Resolution Professional (“RP”) to 
carry out corporate insolvency resolution process of the corporate debtor vide same 
order.

informed that the Resolution Plan of the Company has been approved by the Hon’ble 
NCLT vide its order dated 09.10.2025. 
 
3. Further, in reference to our disclosure dated 10.10.2025; wherein we have informed 
the exchange that as per the provisions of approved Resolution Plan a monitoring
