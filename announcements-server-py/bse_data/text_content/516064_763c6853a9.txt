We are particularly encouraged by the accelerated expansion of our Green Products segment, which delivered ₹123 million in revenue. 
This segment holds significant long-term potential and we are strategically positioned to scale it further as sustainability becomes an 
imperative across industries. We remain deeply committed to fostering environmentally responsible solutions and have proactively

What Is Water Soluble Film (WSF)?
17
Watersol
  is our flagship brand, representing a commitment to creating eco-
friendly, water-soluble packaging solutions. With sustainability at its core, 
Watersol offers a wide array of products that dissolve in water, providing a 
green solution for industries seeking to minimize their environmental 
impact.
Water-soluble film (WSF) is a flexible film made from Polyvinyl Alcohol that 
dissolves entirely in water, leaving no residue. These films have high strength 
and tear resistance and can be used by various consumers and industries in 
the form of packaging and industrial consumables.
RM Process Value Addition

Packaging: Used extensively 
for unit dose packaging of 
detergents, agrochemicals and 
dyes. 
Healthcare: Specifically 
developed for use in hospitals 
and healthcare facilities, these 
PVOH-based bags allow for the 
safe and hygienic handling of 
contaminated linen. 
.
Agriculture: Used for 
packaging pesticides and 
fertilizers, reducing exposure 
risk for handlers and 
minimizing environmental 
impact.
T extiles: Used in embroidery as 
water soluble backing 
materials which dissolves 
completely after the 
embroidery process.
.
Consumer Goods: Applied in 
making pouches for laundry 
detergents, dishwashing 
liquids, and other household 
cleaning products. Water 
soluble film provides a 
convenient and mess-free 
solution for packaging liquid 
and powder detergents.
