Independent Auditor's Limited Review Report on Unaudited half year ended Consolidated financial 
results of TAKYON NETWORKS LIMITED pursuant to the regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations 
and Disclosures Requirements) Regulations, 2015 as amended 
To, 
The Board of Directors 
Takyon Networks Limited 
We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited Consolidated financial results ('the 
Statement') of Takyon Networks Limited (‘the Holding Company'), its Subsidiaries (together referred to 
as “the Group” for the half year ended 30" September, 2025 being submitted by the company pursuant 
to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including relevant circulars issued by the SEBI from time to time. 
The preparation of the statement in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid 
down in Accounting Standard 25 “Interim Financial Reporting” prescribed under section 133 of the 
companies Act, 2013 as amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting 
principles and generally accepted in India, read with the circular is the responsibility of the Holding 
company’s management and has been approved by the Board of Director of the Company. Our 
responsibility is to issue a report on these financial statements based on our review. 
We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements 
(SRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the 
Entity", issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial 
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting 
matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope 
than an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) 
of the Companies Act 2013, and consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would 
become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion. 
This statement Includes the results of the following entity — 
Takyon Networks Limited 
TNPLIT Services Private Limited 
We did not review the financial statements of the subsidiary included in the consolidated financial 
statements; whose financial statements include total revenues of Rs. 430.28 Lakhs (before consolidation 
adjustments) for the half year ended on that date.
These Financial Statement have been reviewed by the Subsidiaries company auditor RSJB & ASSOCIATES

Independent Auditor's Limited Review Report on Unaudited half year ended Standalone financial results of 
TAKYON NETWORKS LIMITED pursuant to the regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosures 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 as amended 
To, 
The Board of Directors 
Takyon Networks Limited, 
We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Unaudited Standalone Financial Results of Takyon Networks 
Limited("the Company"), for the half year ended 30™ September, 2025 ("the Statement"), being submitted by the 
Company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended), including relevant circulars issued by the SEBI from time to time. 
The preparation of the statement in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in 
Accounting Standard 25 “Interim Financial Reporting” prescribed under section 133 of the companies Act, 2013 as 
amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles and generally accepted in 
India, read with the circular is the responsibility of the company’s management and has been approved by the 
Board of Director of the Company. Our responsibility is to issue a report on these financial statements based on 
our review. 
We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410 
"Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity", issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, 
primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review 
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards on 
Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act, and consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that 
we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion. 
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 
accompanying statement of standalone unaudited financial results prepared in accordance with applicable 
Accounting Standards (AS) and other recognized accounting practices and policies has not disclosed the 
information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) including the manner in which it s to be disclosed, or that it 
contains any material misstatement.
