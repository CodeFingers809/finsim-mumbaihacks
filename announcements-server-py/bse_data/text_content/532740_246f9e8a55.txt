Rating Rationale
Acuite has downgraded its long-term rating to 
'ACUITE BBB-' (read as ACUITE triple B
minus) 
from 
'ACUITE BBB' (read as ACUITE triple B) 
and short-term rating to 
'ACUITE A3 '(read as
ACUITE A three)
 from 
'ACUITE A3+'(read as ACUITE A three plus) 
on Rs.208.42 Cr. bank facilities
of Lokesh Machines Limited (LML). The rating is removed from ‘Under Watch with Negative
Implications’. The outlook is 
'Stable'.
Rationale for downgrade:
The rating downgrade reflects deterioration in the operating performance since Q3FY2025
and the same has been continued in H1FY2026, due to inclusion of company’s name in the
Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions list by United States Department of Treasury.
Further, the scale of operations are likely to remain subdued in the near term, as the
proceedings related to removal from US sanctions are under process. The rating remains
constrained by intensive nature of its working capital operations and intense competition in
the industry.  
Further, the rating considers healthy financial risk profile, the company’s long-term presence in
the market for more than two and a half decades, and its established relations with the
customers.

Analytical Approach
Acuité has considered the standalone business and financial risk profile of LML to arrive at the
rating.
 
Key Rating Drivers
Strengths
Established track record in the machine tools industry and its long-term association with the
clientele
The company’s long-standing presence of nearly four decades in the machine tools segment
has helped it develop strong expertise in design and manufacturing, enabling it to provide
customized machines to customers. Furthermore, the promoters’ four decades of experience
in the machine tools industry have contributed to building healthy relationships with customers
(automotive original equipment manufacturers) and suppliers, as well as a diversified
distribution network, which supports repeat orders to an extent. The company ranks among
the top five CNC machine manufacturers in India. Acuité believes that the promoters’
experience, understanding of market dynamics, and established relationships with suppliers
and customers will continue to support the business profile over the medium term.
Healthy financial risk profile
The company’s financial risk profile is comfortable marked by healthy net worth, low gearing
and moderate debt protection metrics. The net worth of the company stood at Rs.212.36 Cr
and Rs.195.44 Cr as on March 31, 2025, and 2024 respectively. The improvement in net worth is
due to equity infusion. The gearing of the company remained below unity at 0.63 times as on
March 31, 2025, against 0.60 times as on March 31, 2024. The debt protection metrics –
interest coverage ratio and debt service coverage ratio stood though declined but remain
moderate at 1.97 times and 1.14 times as on March 31, 2025, respectively as against 3.66
times and 1.86 times as on March 31, 2024, respectively. Acuité believes that the financial risk
profile will remain healthy in the absence of any major debt-funded capital expenditure plan
in the near term.
 
Weaknesses
Decline in scale of operations
The company reported a revenue decline of 22.22 percent in FY2025 i.e., Rs. 293.54 Cr in
FY2024 to Rs. 228.32 Cr in FY2025, following the inclusion of LML’s name in the OFAC list. This led
to disruption in the supply of electronic components from a key supplier, adversely impacting
production. Further, in H1 FY2026, the company’s operating revenue moderated to Rs. 98.48
Cr. as against Rs. 137.84 Cr. in H1 FY2025. The company has an unexecuted order book
position of Rs.116 Cr. as on October 16th, 2025. The decline in scale of operations, and
relatively unchanged fixed costs, led to EBITDA margin decreased from 13.88 percent in
FY2024 to 12.51 percent in FY2025, while PAT margin fell sharply from 4.72 percent to 0.24
percent due to higher depreciation and finance costs. Further, Acuite learns from the
management that it has taken steps to resolve the issue and expects a favorable outcome
in the near term, however, the scale of operations are likely to remain subdued in the near
term, as the proceedings are under process. Going ahead, Acuite will continue to monitor the
impact of the sanction on the overall financial and business risk profile of the company.
Working capital intensive operations
LML’s working capital operations is intensive marked by high gross current Asset (GCA) 
at 306
days in FY2025. 
The GCA days are impacted mainly on account of high inventory days. The
inventory levels of the company have been historically high owing to the lengthy order
execution cycle, as these are capital goods, a large part of inventory remains under work in
progress stage. Inventory days stood at 250 days in FY2025 as against 170 days in FY2024.
Debtor day stood moderate at 55 days in FY2025 as against 51 days in FY2024. Acuité
believes that the working capital operations of the company will remain intense as evident
from its high inventory levels; due to the time taken to execute the orders of machine tools
operating cycle takes between 4 to 8 months (SPM is 9 -12 months & GPM is 3-4 months) and
for component division the operating cycle is 2 months resulting in the large working capital
requirement and staggered deliverables.
Intense competition in industry
LML continues to face stiff competition from domestic players in the standardized machinery
segment and from imports in the case of high value-added specialized and customized
products, which limits its pricing flexibility and margins to an extent. Further, the company’s
margins remain susceptible to fluctuations in raw material prices as its orders are of a fixed
price in nature. Its major raw materials include steel and steel components. Furthermore, the
revenue profile is also concentrated on the auto segment; the auto industry has been facing
headwinds in the recent fiscal and, thereby impacting demand for LML’s products and its
profitability. However, going forward, consolidation in the industry and LML’s efforts to diversify
its sectoral space are likely to support its revenues.
Rating Sensitivities
​
Significant growth in revenue and profitability
Further stretch in the working capital cycle leading to an increase in working capital
borrowing and weakening of financial risk profile
Deterioration in capital structure and other credit metrics due to any large, debt-funded
capex/acquisition
 
Liquidity Position: Adequate
LML liquidity is adequate, marked by net cash accruals of Rs.14.41 Cr in FY2025 against  its
maturing debt obligations of Rs. 8.86 Cr. Going forward the company is expected to generate
adequate net cash accruals for its maturing debt obligation. The current ratio stood
moderate at 1.28 times as on March 31, 2025. Further, the reliance on bank limits utilization
stood high at ~92 percent for the fund-based limits and 45 percent for the non-fund-based
limits for the past nine months ending in Oct 2025. The company maintains unencumbered
cash and bank balances of Rs.0.18 Cr as on March 31, 2025. Acuité believes that the liquidity
of the company is likely to improve over the medium term.

Note on complexity levels of the rated instrument
In order to inform the investors about complexity of instruments, Acuité has categorized such
instruments in three levels: Simple, Complex and Highly Complex. Acuite’s categorisation of
the instruments across the three categories is based on factors like variability of the returns to
the investors, uncertainty in cash flow patterns, number of counterparties and general
understanding of the instrument by the market. It has to be understood that complexity is
different from credit risk and even an instrument categorized as 'Simple' can carry high levels
of risk. For more details, please refer Rating Criteria “Complexity Level Of Financial
Instruments” on
