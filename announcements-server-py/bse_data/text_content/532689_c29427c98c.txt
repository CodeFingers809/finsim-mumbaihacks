PVR INOX BRINGS CINEMAGIC TO DELHI FOR THE FIRST TIME! 
AT ELEGANTE UNITY ONE MALL, NSP , PITAMPURA 
~ PVR INOX introduces luxury cinema to Pitampura with a brand-new six-screen multiplex 
featuring 2 Luxe auditoriums, 1 P[XL], and 3 uniquely themed mainstream auditoriums — all set 
within Elegante Unity One Mall~ 
 
New Delhi 20th Nov 2025: PVR INOX Limited, India’s largest and most premium multiplex chain, proudly 
announces the launch of PVR INOX CINEMAGIC, a state -of-the-art six-screen multiplex at Elegante Unity 
One Mall, Netaji Subhash Place (NSP), Pitampura, Delhi. Conceptualized as “A New Era Cinema 
Experience,” this launch marks a significant milestone in redefining the movie -going experience — 
seamlessly integrating entertainment, retail, and lifestyle into one immersive destination. 
The opening of this property also reflects the company ’s growing focus on its Capital Light Model  of 
expansion, which includes both the Asset Light and FOCO formats. Cinemagic at Elegante Unity One marks 
the second cinema to be developed under the Asset Light model, where capex is jointly shared between 
the developer and PVR INOX. In parallel, the company continues to scale rapidly through the FOCO format 
as well, having opened 16 screens across four cinemas this year where the developer invests 100% of the 
capex while PVR INOX operates the cinema through a management-fee model. 
The six-screen PVR INOX Cinemagic boasts a total of 792 seats, featuring 2 Luxe auditoriums, 1 P[XL], and 
3 mainstream screens. Each auditorium is equipped with state -of-the-art technology, including 4K Laser 
Projection, Dolby 7.1 Surround Sound, and luxurious recliner seating, delivering an exceptional fusion of 
visual brilliance, immersive acoustics, and ultimate comfort. 
Strategically located in Pitampura, one of Delhi’s most vibrant and fast-growing neighborhoods, PVR INOX 
Cinemagic at Elegante Unity One  stands out as a one -of-a-kind destination where cinema meets 
gastronomy. Beyond its world -class projection and sound, the multiplex offers an exceptional range of 
gourmet food and beverage experiences — from chef -curated menus to handcrafted beverages — 
redefining the way guests experience movies. Designed as more than just a cinema, it serves as a space to 
dine, unwind, and immerse in the finest cinematic indulgence. 
The design concept reimagines the cinema as a holistic lifestyle journey. At its heart lies a sunlit central 
atrium, anchoring the spatial layout with a sense of openness and fluidity. Surrounding this core, the 
auditoriums radiate outward to create natural movement and  visual connectivity. Guests are welcomed 
through a contemporary pre -function zone featuring a modern ticketing hub and curated lifestyle 
accessories. The main foyer unfolds into a vibrant casual gaming zone and the Luxe Lounge — an elegant 
social space de signed for relaxed pre- and post-movie gatherings. The venue also features a perfumery 
and nail bar, allowing guests to indulge and unwind even without a movie ticket. 
 
Mr. Ajay Bijli, Managing Director, PVR INOX Limited, said,“ We are delighted to introduce luxury cinema 
to Pitampura for the very first time with our new six -screen multiplex at Elegante Unity One Mall. This 
property embodies our belief that movie-going today is as much about the overall experience as it is about 
the film itself. Our aim was to create a space where guests can indulge in comfort, exceptional food, and 
thoughtful design—all coming together to make every visit truly memorable.” 
Mr. Sanjeev Kumar Bijli, Executive Director, PVR INOX Limited, added , “ With this new property, we 
continue to redefine the future of urban entertainment in India. The design seamlessly integrates cinema, 
retail, and lifestyle into one continuous experience —inviting people to connect, unwind, and spend 
meaningful time together. Elegante Unity One Mall provides the ideal backdrop for this vision, and we look 
forward to establishing it as a vibrant cultural and social hub in Pitampura.” 
Mr. Aamer Bijli, Lead Marketing & Innovations, PVR INOX Limited, said, “For today’s audiences — 
especially Gen Z and young millennials — cinema is no longer a single-purpose destination. It is a social 
experience, a place to gather, create memories, and engage with culture. With Cinemagic at Elegante 
Unity One Mall, we wanted to design a cinema that mirrors this shift. From curated F&B and gaming 
zones to lifestyle elements like a nail bar and perfumery, this space brings together entertainment, design 
and self-expression under one roof. Our goal is to build cinemas that function as modern social hubs — 
places where people come not just to watch a film, but to discover a lifestyle.” 
Each auditorium at PVR INOX Cinemagic is designed with a distinct visual identity, offering guests a unique 
and immersive sensory experience. The three mainstream auditoriums, accommodating 358 guests, draw 
inspiration from the elements — Forest, Galaxy, and Ocean — each featuring plush recliners in the last 
row for enhanced comfort. The P[XL] auditorium, defined by its rust and black palette and striking 
geometric wall panels, delivers a grand large-format cinematic experience for 298 guests. Completing the 
ensemble, the two Luxe auditoriums, adorned in warm brown and beige tones, are crowned by a stunning 
central chandelier and feature 136 luxurious recliner seats, epitomizing comfort and elegance. 
The launch of PVR INOX Cinemagic at Elegante  Unity One Mall, Pitampura underscores the brand ’s 
unwavering commitment to design -led innovation and its mission to craft world -class cinematic 
destinations across India’s leading cities.
