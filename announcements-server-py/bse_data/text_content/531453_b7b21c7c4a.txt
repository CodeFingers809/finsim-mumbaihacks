INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S LIMITED REVIEW REPORT 
To, 
Board of Directors of 
MOHIT INDUSTRIES LIMITED 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of Standalone Unaudited Financial Results 
('the Statement') ofMOHIT INDUSTRIES LIMITED ('the Company') for the quarter and 
six months ended September 30, 2025 which are included in the accompanying 'Unaudited 
Standalone Financial Results for the Quarter and Six Months Ended September 30, 2025, the 
statement of assets and liabilities as on that date and the statement of cash flows for the six 
months ended on that date (the "Statement"). The Statement has been prepared by the 
Company pursuant to Regulation 33 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (the "Listing Regulation s, 
2015"), which has been initialed by us for identification purposes. 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and approved by 
the Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial 
Reporting" ("Ind AS 34"), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and 
other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to express a 
conclusio n on the Statement based on our review 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity", issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
India. This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate 
assurance as to whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. A review 
is limited primarily to inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures applied to 
financial data and thus provide less assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit 
and accordingly , we do not express an audit opinion. 
4. Based on information provided to us by the management, the company has not provided for 
Post Employment Benefits and other long term employee benefits under Defined Benefit 
Plans on accrual basis but provides the same as and when they become due for payment. 
This method of accounting of Post Employment Benefits and other long term employee 
benefits under Defined Benefit Plans is in deviation with Ind AS - 19 on Employee Benefits. 
As there is no actuarial report or basis of calculation available with the management of 
such Post Employment Benefits and other long term employee benefits, the quantum of 
deviation cannot be ascertained. If the company had followed the method accounting as per 
Ind AS - 19, then employee benefit expense would have increased and correspondingly 
Profit for the period would have reduced.

5. Based on our review of the Statement conducted as above, with the exception of the matter 
described in the preceding paragraph no. 4, nothing has come to our attention that causes us 
to believe that the Statement has not been prepared in all material respects in accordance 
with the applicable Accounting Standards prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies 
Act, 2013 and other recognised accounting practices and policies, and has not disclosed the 
information required to be disclosed in te1ms of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations, 
2015 including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material 
misstatement.

The above Unaudited Standalone Financial Result$ for the Quarter and Half year ended on 30th September, 2025 wete reviewed by 1he Audit Committee and 
thereafter approved at the meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company held on 14th November 2025 
2 The Compan:ts Management, pursuant to Ind AS 108 • Operating Segments, has conciuded that the company has only ooe reportable segment i.e Textile. 
Accordingly. Segment wise disclosures requirement is not applicable to Company. 
3 With reference to auditor's qualifrc.ation in limited review report dated 14th November 2025, the board is of the opinion that the Provision for Post Employment 
Benefits and other long term employee b-enefils are determined on the basis of actuarial Valuation Method & technique prescribed in the Ind-AS, The company has 
decided to pay the Post Empk,ymenl Benefits and other k>ng term employee benefits as and when they become due as the amount is negligible and is not going 10 
make any impact on the financial Position of the company. Considering the size of the company and negligible liabiUly, lhe company has not made provisions for Post 
employment benefits ano other long term employee benefils under Defined benefits plan. 
4 Dllring the hatf year, profitabihty was positively Influence<! by strategic cost-reduction intt.iatives. The Company has increased reliance on solar power generation, 
which has reduced energy costs. Although adverse weather conditions in the second quarter restricted generation lo 65% or installed capacity, ou1put is expected to 
improve over the next six months, leading to further enhancement in profilabi1ily. 
5 Additionally, lhe recenl change in BIS guidelines has removed our raw malerial from lhe mandatory compliance lisl, enabling the Company to increase imports at 
more compelitive prices. This flexibility in sourcing is expecied to further reduce raw material costs and suppor1 improved profilabi'ity In the coming periods. 
6 Financial Results '°' all lhe period have been prepared and presented in accordance with recognition and measuremenl principles of Ind- AS 34 "Interim Financial 
Reporting".

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S LIMITED REVIEW REPORT 
To, 
Board of Directors of 
MOHIT INDUSTRIES LIMITED 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying statement of Consolidated Unaudited Financial Results 
('the Statement') of MOHIT INDUSTRIES LIMITED ('the Company'), and its share in 
profit of its associates for the quarter and Six Months ended September 30, 2025 which are 
included in 'Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results for the Quarter and Six Month s 
Ended September 30, 2025, the unaudited consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as 
on that date and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the six months ended on that 
date' (the "Statement"), being submitted by the Parent pursuant to the requiremen t of 
Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations , 
2015, as amended , which has been initialed by us for identificat ion purposes. 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Holding Company's management and 
approved by the Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition 
and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial 
Reporting" ("Ind AS 34"), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and 
other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to express a 
conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Perfonned by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity", issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
This Standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assuranc e as 
to whether the Statement is free of material misstatement. A review of interim financial 
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and 
accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing 
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all 
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an 
audit opinion. 
We also performed procedures in accordance with the circular issued by the SEBI under 
Regulation 33(8) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements ) 
Regulations, 2015, as amended, to the extent applicable.

4. This statement includes the results of the following entity: 
• Mohit Overseas Limited (Associate) 
• Mohit Yams Limited (Associate) 
5. Based on information provided to us by the management, the company has not provided for 
Post Employment Benefits and other long term employee ben~fits under Defined Benefit 
Plans on accrual basis but provides the same as and when they become due for payment. 
This method of accounting of Post Employment Ben~fits and other long term employee 
benefits under Defined Benefit Plans is in deviation with Ind AS-19 on Employee Benefits. 
As there is no actuarial report or basis of calculation available with the management of 
such Post Employm ent Benefits and other long term employee benefits, the quantum of 
deviation cannot be ascertained. If the company had.followed the method accounting as per 
Ind AS - 19, then employee benefit expense would have increased and correspondingl y 
Profit for the period would have reduced. 
6. Based on our review of the Statement conducted as above, with the exception of the matter 
described in the preceding paragraph no. 4, nothing has come to our attention that causes us 
to believe that the Statement has not been prepared in all material respects in accordance 
with the applicable Accounting Standards prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies 
Act, 2013 and other recognised accounting practices and policies, and has not disclosed the 
information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations , 
2015 including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material 
misstatement.
