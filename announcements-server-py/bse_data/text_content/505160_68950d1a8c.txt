mode and there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. 
Should you need assistance during the conference call, please signal an operator by pressing star 
then zero on your touchtone phone. Please note this conference is being recorded. 
I now hand the conference over to Mr. Anuj Talwar, Joint Managing Director. Thank you, and 
over to you, sir. 
Anuj Talwar: Good afternoon, everyone. A very warm welcome to our Q2 Earnings and H1 Earnings call for 
FY26. On the call today, I'm joined by Mr. Navin Juneja, our Director o n the Board and our 
Group CFO; and SGA, our Investor Relations advisers. The results and the presentation are 
uploaded on the stock exchange and the company website. I hope everyone has had a chance to 
look at it. 
I would like to start this call by announcing with great enthusiasm, our new joint venture with 
Lohum Cleantech Private Limited. This marks a strategic step in line with our long-term vision 
of expanding capabilities and strengthening our global footprint. The partnersh ip represents a 
significant milestone in Talbros' journey towards sustainable and technology-led growth.  
Through this joint ventur e, we will focus on developing two  key products: a recovered carbon 
black and devulcanized rubber.  Recovered carbon black represents a rapidly growing segment 
within the global $27 billion virgin carbon black market. Similarly, the devulcanized rubber 
market is valued at $3.5 billion globally, which also continues to expand a healthy base, driven 
by increased sustainability, focus of OEMs and tire manufacturers worldwide.  
The collaboration brings together Talbros' strong OEM relationships with the big tire makers as 
well as big Tier 1 OEMs as well who need this product, market reach and manufacturing 
expertise with Lohum's advan ced technology led capabilities and know -how of the product.  
Together, we aim to deliver high -quality sustainable solutions cater to both the domestic and 
international markets.  
Over the next few years, we expect the JV to evolve into a high-growth, value-accretive division 
with Talbros -- within Talbros and contribute to our profitability meaningfully.  Now coming 
back to the automotive industry and come back to the automotive industry overview. In quarter 
2 of FY '26, the Indian automobile industry record ed a healthy growth of 9.5%, with total 
volumes reaching 8.8 million units.  
Growth was supported by steady domestic demand, robust exports, aided by a more stable supply 
chain and favorable currency conditions. The quarter started on a softer note as cons umers 
postponed their purchase ahead of the GST 2 rollout, leading to a very muted demand in early 
September. 
However, volumes rebounded sharply with the onset of Navratri and the festive season. Despite 
the weather-related disruption like extended rains, the quarter closed on a strong note, driven by 
the festive-led recovery. I'm pleased to say that we feel with the new GST taxation norms in the 
country, I think quarter 3 and quarter 4 will be very, very solid.

Segment-wise, the 2 -wheeler industry grew at 10.3% year -on-year to 6.8 million units, 
predominantly because of the rural demand and the GST benefit. The 3-wheeler posted a robust 
growth of 21%, reaching 3.5 lakh units, driven by easier financing and high demand for good 
carriers. Tractor volumes remained stable, benefiting from the GST cut from 12% to 5%. And 
obviously, the favorable monsoons this year added to their glory. 
The passenger vehicle segment showed gradual recovery with 2.4% growth year-on-year to 1.3 
million units, aided by GST reductions. Commercial vehicles registered a 9.4% growth, reaching 
2.6 lakh units, supported by the momentum in infrastructure. 
Now coming to the company's performance. In H1 FY '26, Talbros reported a revenue of INR427 
crores, a performance that was partly impacted by the muted momentum across the automotive 
industry during the period. The quarter for us saw an unexpected disruption due to a cyber-attack 
to one of our large key European clients, which temporarily affected their operations and even 
our operations.  
This led to a onetime business loss of about INR10 crores for the quarter. However, we've 
already recovered a portion of this in Q3 FY '26, and we expect the remainder to come good in 
the year. Despite these short-term challenges, we are pleased to have delivered a robust EBITDA 
of 16.5%, which is, again, a high number in the industry.  
This has happened because of our various operational excellence, cost-saving measures and also 
a focus on a good product mix. Exports remain a significant part of our business, contributing to 
26% of our total revenue. Within the export mix, U.K. accounts for 54%, followed by Europe 
without the U.K. at 26% and the U.S. at 14%.  
This continues to reaffirm Talbros' growing global presence, supported by long -standing 
relationships with leading OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers.  In the domestic market, towards the end 
of the quarter, especially in the last 10 days of September and through October, we have begun 
to see a clear pickup in demand, led by improved OEM schedules and a big traction in the 
domestic market because of this whole GST cut.  
As I mentioned earlier on the call, we are seeing Q3, Q4, in other words, half year H2 to be 
better than the H1.  We at Talbros continue to maintain a balanced revenue mix over domestic 
OEMs, aftermarket and exports and also have a very hedged portfolio by supplying to every 
segment possible from the lightest 2-wheeler to the heaviest truck.  
Looking ahead, our strategic focus remains on business diversification, strengthening OEM 
relationships, margin enhancement through a sharper product mix and continued cost 
optimization. We are also actively exploring new product line and technologies with new 
partners in the future. 
With this, I request Mr. Navin Juneja to update you on the financial performance. Thank you. 
Navin Juneja: Thank you, Anuj. Good afternoon, and a warm welcome to all the participants. Let me begin

of FY '26, it stood at INR70 crores. EBITDA margins for Q2 FY '26 stood at 16.4% and for H1 
of FY '26, it stood at 16.5%, marginally lower than last year because of increase in employee

FY '26, it stood at INR45 crores as compared to INR44 crores of the same period last year, a

at INR65 crores in H1 of FY '26. EBITDA stood at INR4 cores in Q2 of FY '26 and for H1 it

Looking ahead, we see numerous opportunities that promise ongoing growth within the 
automotive sector.  
The organization has made substantial investment in the new technologies, capacity 
enhancement, product diversification and growth of its customer base and market reach. These 
efforts are expected to position the company well to seize future opportunities, enhance diversity 
and drive long-term growth. This is all from our side, and I would now like to open the floor to 
questions and answers. 
Moderator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question 
is from the line of Deepen Shah from Six Sense. Please go ahead, sir.

Deepen Shah: Good morning, sir and thank you for the opportunity. I  had a couple of questions. If you could 
just give us some more insight into maybe some new customers or new contracts which you 
would have added in maybe the Gasket or the Forging business and more importantly, on th e 
Marelli business. So that is the first question.  And the second question is that for the Forgings 
and the Gasket s business, you have given some guidance for FY '27 in the PPT. If you could 
give us some more insights into how the Marelli and Marugo Rubber businesses could be? 
Navin Juneja: Thank you. Regarding adding new customer, you mentioned, of course, we added new 
customers like Kia, which has been delayed for last 1 year because of the approvals from Korea, 
etc., which are now being cleared and we expected to start the heat shield for that business from 
January of '26 in this financial year only, that business is around INR13 to INR15 crores per 
annum. This is one. 
Number two, the Kamaz business of Russia, which was, again, pending for last 7 to 8 months 
has now been cleared. The sample has been, I think, been delivered. So we expected that business 
to be started around -- again around January, February of next year, that is around INR10 crores 
per annum business.  
Plus the new business of Tata -- sorry Cummins gasket, which we are fighting for last 3 years. 
Now it has been cleared, everything has been cleared and supply is posed to commence again 
from January, February of next year. This is a again a INR10 crores business.  
These are the three majors, n ew additions we are coming in a very, very ne ar future than that, 
except that there are some ot her export orders of the small quantities , which has been -- also 
been getting mature and put into production in the next couple of months.  
Beside this, again, an order of Tata Motors heat shield, which are now been cleared, and took 
lot of time goes in testing etc., it has now been approved, the commercial are being in the process 
of being closed. So that will also start the production. So that is. 
And regarding our Forging business, Forging business got a huge hit in this quarter because of 
JLR business, they lost INR5 crores to INR7 crores business because of -- you know that JLR -
- the customer, it was a huge problem. Because of cyberattack, there was zero sales in the month 
of September, until 7th October, there was zero sales, it has recovered 20% in the month of 
October, and it will be recovered 60% by November and by December, it will be back on 100%. 
That we got the hit. 
Plus other hit we got from the BMW. We got the muted growth from BMW because our bush 
goes in EV vehicles, EV vehicles sales has dropped in the BMW business. It is -- muted growth 
is there in that business. Thirdly, my GKN business also suffered a -- because there was some -
- there was some… 
Anuj Talwar: Ford Mustang recalled. 
Navin Juneja: Ford, they were trying to depart to the Ford. That vehicle got a recall etc. So that not because of 
our product. Just other products things got a recall.  So the volume has come down drastically 
on that. 
  Talbros Automotive Components Limited

Anuj Talwar: Europe was not very interesting last 6 months. 
Navin Juneja: My export and that division has come down by 3%, 4% because of this. But it’s is temporary 
phase and the pain is there for this quarter. From January onwards, it's back on track. Don't worry 
about that. We are very, very -- and new businesses, we are talking to Daimler and JCB new 
businesses also and DANA also new businesses are in the process of production, trials are done 
etc., and development is there. So it will come on production also. 
And good news also in this business, we have got the order from Mercedes and same part we 
supply to BMW. Now we got order from Mercedes. The supply -- some samples are going in 
the month of November and December.  And thus, I think the volume will grow from January 
onwards in that business, same Toho business, we got orders from Mercedes also  in there. So 
that is -- on the peak volume, that is INR20 crores business. This is the start-up -- this is a startup. 
Of course, as we got Marelli, Marelli of course, we are back on track. All the Maruti business of 
EV, etc., have been started in there. The major order, we talk about Stellantis order for which 
because of the testing, etc.. First, the design which got changed, now the testing, happen, now 
the sample -- the final sample has gone there, and that we're going to push on test . But I think 
on next Wednesday. Within 50 days, that will be cleared and from January, the production will 
start in that. 
Regarding -- the second question of growth you've given, Marelli, of course, given the growth 
of 700 for the gasket division , 400 for Forging. Marelli we expect around INR500 crores and 
Marugo we expect about INR170 crores in FY '27. Okay? 
Dipen Shah: Okay. So then that would be in about INR1,100 crores INR600, about INR1,800 crores in the 
next year come from... 
Navin Juneja: Somewhere INR1,750 crores to INR1,800 crores it should be. This is about 90% as of today. 
Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ravi Shah from BRS Capital. Please go ahead. 
Ravi Shah: Thank you for the opportunity, sir. Sir my first question would be on the EBITDA margin. So 
in Q2, our margin stood at 16.4%. So have we seen any one-off in these employee cost, which 
is there. And what should be a steady state EBITDA margin if it is not the case? 
Navin Juneja: In the business -- in the same product mix, the exports goes a little up in the Forging division in 
future. The EBITDA margins should around 16.5%, it should be there. 
Ravi Shah: Okay. Understood, sir. Sir, my next question is on the export business. Sir, on the exports, so 
currently it contributes around 26% of total revenue in H1 . And we are seeing, excluding UK, 
UK has 54, so remaining US 14, etc.. So how are you looking at this panning out? And apart 
from the cyberattack -- what is the demand in the region, apart from the cyberattack, which 
happened in our plant? 
Anuj Talwar: Yes, the demand in Europe has been muted, but I think from January onwards, it will come up. 
Number two, USA has been positive for us till now. But I think the tariff clarity are just around 
  Talbros Automotive Components Limited 
  November 14, 2025 
 
Page 7 of 10 
 
the corner. But because our products are very highly engineered, it's not easy to substitute our 
products. So we see pricing starting next year, calendar next year, exports to be much better. We 
might gain 1%, 1.5% over 26% on exports next year. 
Navin Juneja: Much more. Our target is around 35% by FY '27.  If the Stellantis business starts 100% export, 
it is a huge order of INR100 crores plus, INR150 crores, which starts in January this year. 
Ravi Shah: Understood, sir. Thank you sir for the detailed answer. Sir, my last question will be on the equity 
commitment for our new JV. So what is our capex requirement also for the next 2, 3 years for a 
ramp-up of the JV as well? 
Navin Juneja: JV capex in the next 2 years is INR70 crores. First 2 years is INR70 crores, which includes our 
debt and equity, 40% equity, 60% debt. 
Ravi Shah: Understood, sir. Thank you so much, sir, and all the best. 
Navin Juneja: Thank you.  
Moderator: The next question is from the line of Sakshi from Pratab Securities. Please go ahead. 
Sakshi:  I have three questions. Firstly, what competitive advantage does the JV offer us versus the 
existing RCB or rubber recycling players in India? 
Navin Juneja: Yes. First I'll tell you this -- first of all that is Lohum. I will just give you background of Lohum 
before we give the answer of the last question. Lohum is an R&D-led company. You can go by 
website and see the company. And it has a full R&D team of -- R&D center of its own, which 
are more than 100 engineers in it, out of it, 8-10 are PhD. 
They have filed IP’s about 300, out of which 10 has already been given to them . They are the 
largest producers of cobalt in India, larg est recyclers of lithium -ion batteries in India, largest 
battery dismantling and testing facility they are out in India. And other critical materials such as 
platinum, good metals, rare earth and etc., they are working on that . So this is a technology 
company. 
Now what is offered in the market today. Market today is the carbon black is available. Some 
companies like Birla Carbon and some other companies are entering into that business. The 
existing recyclers have recovered carbon black of with 18% to 20% ash content as compared to 
virgin. 
Lohum R&D has already tested the material and our product will give consistently have -- sulfur 
percentage of around 5% only ash content will be there. It is very close to the new, new virgin 
material and price will be approximately 25% to 30% cheaper as compared to the new. 
Now coming to a devulcanization portion. Devulcanization is already there in the industry. And 
because a lot of tire manufacturer required -- you know that tire manufacturer are required to get 
the EPR because the government is pushing them to had the product recycled. So this is a step 
towards that. Existing process, which is being used by them till is very polluting and with very 
low percentage of substitution. 
  Talbros Automotive Components Limited 
  November 14, 2025 
 
Page 8 of 10 
 
Our process, we have -- I think they have identified the machine manufacturer, coordinating the 
machine from Germany and they have tested the product. Our -- this process is very clean and 
our product will have very high substitution percentage, and it will be as good as the new rubber. 
So these are plus, this will also generate EPR credit for us. 
Sakshi: Thanks for the detailed answer. Now given that RCB is going at 35 plus percentage CAGR 
globally. How much of this opportunity is realistically addressable for us? 
Navin Juneja: We are targeting next 5 years, the revenue top line of around INR500 crores to INR600 crores 
in this business altogether, with a very healthy EBITDA of 15% plus. 
Sakshi: Got it. And my third question, sir, is excluding the cyberattac k impact, underlying revenue 
growth still appears muted. So what structural gaps or product level slowdowns are causing this 
divergence? 
Anuj Talwar: I think, look, we had a -- it was a bit muted. Europe was slow, the cyberattack happened. There 
was a little bit of a GST momentum. But I think Q3, Q4 will be much, much, much better. 
Navin Juneja: So there was a muted demand of commercial vehicles in this quarter. My commercial vehicles, 
share of the business has gone  down domestically. Domestically commercial were very bad. 
And you must have heard Tata Motor vehicle were not selling it in the month of June and July. 
July, August, they were not selling , very low demand. So now it has been recovered. We have 
got very good numbers in October, and we have -- November is also looking very good for us. 
Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Yash Shah from 3A Capital Services. Please 
go ahead. 
Yash Shah: Sir, what kind of margins and revenue you can expect from this Lohum JV? 
Navin Juneja: The new Lohum JV will be 15% to 18% EBITDA margins because in the recycl ing business, 
the raw material cost is very low. 
Yash Shah: Okay. Okay. And in terms of other business in Europe, how we expect it to ramp up? 
Navin Juneja: What you said in the other business. 
Anuj Talwar: The Europe business. 
Navin Juneja: Europe business, it will not be so much muted because of JLR, etc., it was affected. Now JLR is 
back on track. There will be backlog orders.  Their production is now ramping up. They are 
ramping the production. It will be -- I think you will see better figures in the next 6 months, a 
decent percent  -- my export percentage should come back to 28% or 29% in this quarter, 
definitely in the next half. It may not -- of course, little bit BMW will be pulled down, but we 
will recover from somewhere else. It is not a big thing. 
Moderator:  The next question is from the line of Sachin from SVAN Investment Manager. Please go ahead. 
  Talbros Automotive Components Limited 
  November 14, 2025 
 
Page 9 of 10 
 
Sachin: My question is regarding this -- the way we have taken this new in itiative regarding recycling, 
are we looking at any more growth opportunities, new joint ventures or technical collaborations, 
which can improve the overall growth trajectory for the next 3 to 4 years for the company? 
Anuj Talwar: Yes, we are. 
Navin Juneja: Definitely. Definitely, but give me some time, we'll first ramp up these things you've said. And 
we are definitely we are open. We are open. 
Anuj Talwar: We're talking to people in Japan, in Korea, it's an ongoing exercise always. 
Sachin: Sure. Secondly, you mentioned about recovery in your leading European client because of the 
cyberattack. So when you say 60% recovery, you mean to say that whatever loss , that is the 
normal plan for October plus what was lost for 60%? Or what was planned for October that 60% 
of that? Can you just clarify? 
Navin Juneja: I'm saying whatever the ir capacity, whatever order book you are getting earlier , suppose I am 
getting a order of INR5 crores , I am getting now INR3 crores with that. First, in September, it 
was zero, no order because they were not manufacturing, they were closed. In October, they give 
us -- because they started production from 7th November in one of the plant s and 7th October 
in another plant, then for 15th from some other plant. So my supply up to 25% were delivered. 
November, it is 60%, from December 100% will be delivered. I mean to say that monthly 
schedules are to that level -- coming back to that level. 
Sachin: So for the full, you mentioned about INR1,750 crores, INR1,800 crores of revenue for next year. 
Can you give us some sense now how we are picking in the second half income? Because you 
said that Q3, Q4 will be very strong. So if you can give us any sense, I guess, 635 that we did in 
H1. How much we can expect in H2? 
Navin Juneja: Yes, definitely. In the past 6 month you say we were flat as compared to last year. On a good 
turnover wise, we achieved 646 as opposed to 632, a growth of 2%. By the year end, this figure 
will be 10%. 
Sachin: For the second half or for the full year, I think 10%? 
Navin Juneja: Full year. Full year. Full year, it should be. 
Sachin: Full year. And in terms of... 
Navin Juneja: We are recovering very, very fast. 
Sachin: Sure. And in terms of the capex plan for current year and next year, what are the capex plans we 
are having? 
Navin Juneja: My capex, as I told earlier, it's is going on in the Gasket and Forging  division, that capex would 
be around INR50 crores, okay? And Marugo reached INR8 crores, in my Marelli business 
already a lot of capex has been spent, it is around INR60 crores for this year.

Sachin: And in terms of your funnel and pipeline for the new opportunities, especially for the new orders, 
can you give us some sense how is the funnel looking like? In between, we won two large orders 
of INR500 crores, INR500 crore s, close to INR500 crores last year. Are you working on any 
such large orders....? 
Navin Juneja: Orders are coming. I will announce when the amount becomes sufficient. That means we will 
come back something by March on that. 
Moderator: As there are no further questions from the participants. I now hand the conference over to the 
management for the closing comments. 
Anuj Talwar: Thank you so much for being on the call. As mentioned to you earlier, we are enthusiastic about 
a new joint venture. We're going to work on our export business, India business, and we're very 
hopeful with the GST cut by the government, I think quarter 3, quarter 4, will be much, much 
better. Thank you. Bye.. 
Navin Juneja: Bye. Thank you. 
Moderator: On behalf of Talbros Automotive Components Limited, that concludes this conference. You 
may now disconnect your lines. Thank you for joining us.
