Independent Auditor's Limited Review Report on the unaudited standalone Quarterl y 
Financial results and Year to date results of the Coffee Day Enterprises Limited pursuant to 
the regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing obligat ions and Disclosure Requirements) 
Regulations, 201 5, as amended 
To the Board of Directors of 
Coffee Day Enterprises Limited 
1. We were engaged to review the accompanying statement of unaudited standalone financial Results 
of Coffee Day Enterprises Limited ('the Company') for the quarter ended September 30, 2025, and year 
to date results for the period from 01 April 2025 to 30 September 2025. 
2. It is the responsibility of the Company's Management and Board of Directors to prepare this 
Statement in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian 
Accounting Standard 34 'Interim Financial Reporting' ('Ind AS 34'), prescribed under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 as amended, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and in 
compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. The statement has been approved by the 
Company's Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the financial Results 
based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the financial Results in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagement (SRE) 2410, 'Review of Interim Financial Informa tion Performed by the Independent 
Auditor of the Entity', issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires 
that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the financial results 
are free of material misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of company personnel and 
analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus provides less assurance than an audit. We have 
not performed an audit and accord'ngly, we do not express an audit opinion .

Because of the matters described in the paragraph 4 below, we were not able to obtain sufficient 
appropriate evidence to provide a basis for conclusion on the statement and hence we do not express 
a conclusion on the results. 
4. Basis for disclaimer of conclusion 
a. We have not been provided with sufficient evidence with respect to recoverability of dues from group 
companies amounting to INR 1,519.21 crores stated to be recoverable by the management (as detailed 
in Note 7 of the Standalone Financials Results). We are therefore unable to comment on the 
recoverability of the stated balance from group companies and the impact on the standalone financial 
results. 
b. Attention is drawn to Note 6, 8 and 11 of the standalone financial results, wherein instances of non-
compliance with certain debt covenants including interest & principal repayment defaults have been 
described. We also draw attention to the fact that the Company has not obtained the balance 
confirmations on loans from lenders. In the absence of adequate and sufficient audit evidence to 
establish the amounts payable to the lenders, we are unable to provide our opinion on the correctness 
of these amounts reflected in the standalone financial results. 
c. The Results has been prepared by the Management and Board of Directors using the going concern 
assumption (Refer Note 9 of the Standalone Financials Results). The matters detailed in the above 
paragraphs may have a consequential implication on the Company's ability to continue as a going 
concern.

30, 2025 ('the Statement'), bemg submitted by the Parent Company pursuant to the requirements of 
Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as 
amended ('Listing Regulations'). 
2. It is the responsibility of the Parent Company's Management and Board of Directors to compile this 
Statement from the individual final accounts prepared by the management of the subsidiaries in 
accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 
'Interim Financial Reporting' ('In d AS 34'), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 as 
amended, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 
33 of the Listing Regulations. The statement has been approved by the Parent Company's Board of 
Directors. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our rev iew. 
3. We have conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagement 
(SRE) 2410, 'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity', 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists 
of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying 
analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in 
accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we 
would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion. 
We are also responsible for performing procedures in accordance with the circular issued by the SEBI 
under Regulation 33 (8) of the Listing Regulations, to the extent applicable.

Consolidated limited review report (continued} 
Due to the matters described in the paragraph 5 below, we were not able to obtain sufficient evidence to 
provide a basis for conclusion on the Statement and hence we do not express a conclusion on the 
Statement. 
4. The Statement includes the results of the entities as per the attached Annexure I. 
5. Basis for disclaimer of conclusion 
a. Attentio n is drawn to Note 5 of the statement wherein a final adjudication order dated 24.01.2023 has been 
served on the company under section 11 (11(4), 11(4A), 118 and 118 ( of the Securities and Exchange 
Board of India Act, 1992 read with Rule 5 of SEBI (Procedure for Holding Inquiry and Imposing Penalties) 
Rules, 1995 by SEBI imposed with a total monetary penalty of Rs.26,00,00,000 (Rupees Twenty-S ix Crore) 
under Section 15HA and Section 15HB of the SEBI Act, 1992 respectively on account of violations of 
provisions of Section 12A(a), (b) & (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 read with Regulations 3(b) , (c) & (d) and 4(1) 
of the PFUTP Regulations as stated in Para 59 and 60 of its order relating to the advances to MACEL by the 
subsidiaries of the Company. 
The company appealed against the above order dated 24th January 2023 to the Hon'ble Securities Appellate 
Tribunal (SAT) which granted stay on the imposition of penalty. 
Further, the Company has initiated arbitration proceedings against MACEL as suggested by Crest Law in 
consultat ion with NSE. In this regard the subsidiaries of the company have filed claim statement as part of 
arbitration proceedings. 
No provision is made in the books of accounts against the amount receivable from MACEL. In the absence 
of any conclusive evidence demonstrated by the company for recoverability of the same, we are unable to 
comment on the recoverabili ty, requirement or otherwise of provision on those receivables and 
consequential impact on these financial results. 
Further, we have in respect of 3 subsidiaries and 1 step-down subsidiary, based on our review, have issued 
a disclaimer of conclusion due to the possible impact of the recoverability of dues from MACEL. Hence, we 
are unable to comment on the recoverability of amount due from MACEL amounting to Rs.3,372.83 Crores 
to the group as a whole.

Consolidated limited review report (continued) 
Similarly in the case of one other subsidiary, the other auditor has issued a disclaimer of conclusion due to 
the possible impact of the recoverability of dues from MACEL. 
b. In respect of the Parent Company and some of the subsidiaries, there are instances of non-compliance with 
certain debt covenants including interest & principal repayment defaults. We also draw attention to the fact 
that the holding Company has not obtained the balance confirmations on loans from lenders. We have been 
informed that during the previous years, certain lenders have exercised their right to recall the loan (refer 
Note 6, Note 8, and Note 10 of the statement). In the absence of adequate and sufficient audit evidence 
to establish the amounts payable to the lenders, we are unable to comment on the consequential 
adjustments that might impact the statement. 
c. We have highlighted in one subsidiary that the subsidiary currently is undergoing a corporate restructuring 
process with its lenders, as detailed in Note No.9 of the Consolidated Financial Results. This restructuring 
involves realigning the company's debt and interest obligations in accordance with the proposed plan as 
per the in-principal approval accorded by all the lenders, which is pending for final execution. Hence, we 
are unable to comment on the completeness of loan balances and its impact in these Consolidated Financial 
Results until the final execution of the restructuring process. 
d. The Consolidated Financial results of the Group have been prepared by the Management and Board of 
Directors using the going concern assumption in view of the positive net-worth of the Group (refer Note 7 
of the Consolidated Financial Results). The matters detailed in the above paragraphs may have a 
consequential implication on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. We have expressed the 
same in the reports of one subsidiary and one step-subsidiary. 
Further, the auditors of one subsidiary and Two step-down subsidiaries have also expressed material 
uncertainty over going concern in their reports. 
e. We draw attention to Note No.14 of the Statement wherein in 1 subsidiary there are doubts on the 
recoverability of capital advance dues aggregating to INR 275 Crores. An agreement for the purchase of 
land at Mumbai had been entered into which has been acquired by City & Industrial Development 
Corporation (CIDCO) nodal agency for acquiring land for Navi Mumbai International Airport. CIDCO has 
proposed alternative land in lieu of the acquisition of land. However, the party has filed legal case for 
monetary compensation instead of alternate land. Hence, we are unable to comment on the recoverability 
of amount due.

Consolidated limited review report (continued) 
f. The subsidiary of the company has not recognized a financial guarantee given to erstwhile subsidiary SICAL 
amounting to Rs.103.27 Crores, which has been invoked by the lenders. Due to the proposed restructuring 
plan with the lender regarding a settlement, we are unable to assess the impact of this matter on the 
financial Results. Accordingly, the level of compliance with the Indian Accounting Standards cannot be 
ascertained by us. 
6. Other matters 
a. We did not review the financial results of two step-down subsidiaries, whose financial results reflect total 
revenues of INR 0.95 Crores, total assets of Rs.8.54 crores and total comprehensive income of Rs.0.49 
crore for the period ended on that date, as considered in the Statement. These financial results have been 
certified by the management. Our conclusion on the Consolidated Financial Results, in so far as it relates to 
the amounts and disclosures included in respect of these subsidiaries is based on the management certified 
financial results. For three step-d own subsidiaries we were not provided with the financial statement s for 
the purpose of consolidation. 
b. We did not review the financial results of one subsidiary having two step-down subsidiaries , whose financial 
results reflect total revenues of INR 19.63 Crores, total assets of Rs.264.20 crores and total comprehensive 
income of Rs.17.84 crore for the period ended 30th September 2025, as considered in the Statement. 
Further, we did not review the financial results of one associate whose share of profit of INR 1.54 Crores is 
considered in the Consolidated Financial Results. These financial results have been certified by other 
auditors whose reports have been furnished to us by the Management and our conclusion on the 
consolidated financial results in so far as it relates to the aforesaid subsidiary is based solely on the reports 
of the other auditors. 
c. Further, we also did not review the financial results of one associate entity having two subsidiaries, whose 
financial results reflect total profit of Rs.2.46 Crores considered in the Consolidated Financial Results. These 
financial results have been certified by other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us by the 
Management and our conclusion on the consolidated financial results in so far as it relates to the aforesaid 
Associate is based solely on the reports of the other auditors. 
d. Further, we did not review the financial results of three Joint Venture (inclu ding its subsidiary) and one 
associate whose share of loss of l NR 1.34 Crores is considered in the Consolidated Financial Results. These 
financial results have been certified by the Management. Our conclusion on the Statement, in so far as it

Independent Auditor's Limited review report on Quarterly Consolidated Interim Financial 
results of Coffee Day Global Limited pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 
To, 
The Board of Directors of Coffee Day Global Limited 
We were engaged to review the accompanying Statement of unaudited consolidated financial results of Coffee 
Day Global Limited ('the Parent Company') and its subsidiaries (the Parent and its subsidiaries together 
referred to as 'the Group'), and its share of the net loss after tax and total comprehensive income of its 
associates and joint ventures for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 ('the Statement'), being submitted 
by the Parent Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI {listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended ('Listing Regulations'). 
It is the responsibility of the Parent Company's Management and Board of Directors to compile this Statement 
from the individual final accounts prepared by the management of the subsidiaries in accordance with the 
recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 'Interim Financial 
Reporting' ('Ind AS 34'), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 of the Listing Regulations. The 
statement has been approved by the Parent Company's Board of Directors. 
Our responsibility is to conduct a review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagement (SRE) 2410, 'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of 
the Entity', issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information 
consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and 
applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit 
conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain 
assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. 
Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
We are responsible for performing procedures in accordance with the circular issued by the SEBI under the 
Regulation 33 (8) of the listing Regulation, to the extend applicable. 
Due to the matters described in the paragraph below, we were not able to obtain sufficient evidence to 
provide a basis for conclusion on the Statement and hence we do not express a conclusion on the Statement. 
The Statement includes the results of the entities as per the attached Annexure I.

Basis for disclaimer of conclusion 
1. We draw attention to Note No.6 of the Consolidated Financial Results which describe the details in 
respect of amounts due from M/s. Mysore Amalgamated Coffee Estates Limited (MACEL) to the extent of 
Rs.995.12 Crores. As explained to us, the company is in the process of recovery of the dues from related 
parties and has taken necessary action as stated in the said notes and further there is no recovery during 
the quarter. In the absence of any conclusive evidence demonstrated by the company for recoverability of 
the same, we are unable to comment on the recoverability, requirement or otherwise of provision on those 
receivables and consequential impact on these Consolidated financial Results. 
2. The company is currently undergoing a corporate restructuring process with its lenders, as detailed in 
Note No.7 of the Consolidated Financial Results. This restructuring involves realigning the company's debt 
and interest obligations in accordance with the proposed plan as per the in-principal approval accorded by 
all the lenders, which is pending final execution. Hence, we are unable to comment on the completeness of 
loan balances and its impact in these Consolidated Financial Results until the final execution of the 
restructuring process. 
3. The company has not recognized a financial guarantee amounting to Rs. 107.25 Crores provided to the 
parent company, Coffee Day Enterprises Limited (CDEL), and to erstwhile co-subsidiary SICAL amounting to 
Rs. 103.27 crores, which has been invoked by the lenders. Due to th e proposed restructuring plan with the 
lender regarding a settlement, we are unable to assess the impact of this matter on the financial Results. 
Accordingly, the level of compliance with the requirements of the I ndian Accounting Standards cannot be 
ascertained by us. 
Other Matters 
We did not review the financial results of 2 Subsidiaries, 2 Step Down Subsidiaries, 3 Joint Ventures and 1 
Partnership Firm whose financial results reflect total assets of INR 8.54 Crores for the period ended 30

result also includes the Group's share of net profit (and other comprehensive income) of INR 0.49 Crore for 
the year ended September 30, 2025. These financial results have not been reviewed by other auditors. 
Further out of the subsidiaries and joint venture mentioned in point above, we have not received neither the 
limited reviewed financial statements nor the management complied accounts of 1 subsidiary, 2 step down 
subsidiaries and 2 joint ventures, for the quarter ended 30th September 2025, and these have not been 
considered in the Statement. The company has informed that the subsidiary is under liquidation and both the
