In terms of SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD-PoD/P/CIR/2025/97 
dated July 02, 2025, the Company would like to inform that the transfer 
requests for shares in physical form which were submitted with the 
Company in the past and the request was rejected and returned due to 
deficiency in the documents/process/or otherwise can be filed again 
after rectifying the errors, for registration of transfer upto the due date of 
January 06, 2026. Eligible shareholders are requested to contact the 
Company’s Registrar and Share Transfer Agents (‘RTA’) M/s. MUFG
