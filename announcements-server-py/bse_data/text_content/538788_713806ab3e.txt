We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results of Gilada Finance and Investments Limited for the quarter ended 30th September, 2025 being submitted by the company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015. This statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and approved by the Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with relevant Rules issued there under and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to issue a report on the statement based on our review. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity", issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus provides less assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and other recognized accounting
