Independent Auditor's Review Report on the Unaudited Quarterly and Year to Date Standalone Financial Results of the 
Company Pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015, as amended 
To 
The Board of Directors of 
Prostarm Info Systems Limited 
(1) We have reviewed the accompanying statement of Standalone Unaudited Financial Results of Prostarm Info 
Systems Limited for the quarter and six month ended September 30, 2025 together with notes thereon ("the 
Statement"), being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (as amended) ('Listing Regulations'). 
(2) This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and has been approved by the Board 
of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in 
Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" ("Ind AS 34"), prescribed under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act"), as amended, read with relevant rules made thereunder and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with the presentation and disclosure requirements of the 
Regulation 33 of Listing Regulations. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our 
review. 
(3) We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE} 2410 
"Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity", issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain 
moderate assurance as to whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. A review is limited 
primarily to inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data and thus provides 
less assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
(4) Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 
accompanying statement of unaudited financial results prepared in accordance with applicable accounting 
standards and other recognized accounting practices and policies has not disclosed the information required to 
be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015 including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
