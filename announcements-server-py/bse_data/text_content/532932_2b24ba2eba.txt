Independent Auditor’sReview Report on standalone unaudited quarterly financial results of the Company
Pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations,
2015
TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF
MANAKSIA LIMITED
I. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Standalone Unaudited Financial Results of Manaksia
Limited ("the Company"), for the quarter ended 30lh September, 2025, and for the period from 1st April 2025
to 30th September 2025, being submitted by the Company pursuant to requirement of Regulation 33 of the
SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended.
2. This statement is the responsibility of the company’s management and approved by the Board of Directors
which has been prepared in accordance with the recognition & measurement principles laid down in the
Indian Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” (“Ind AS 34”), prescribed under Section 133
of the Companies Act, 2013 read with relevant Rules issued there under and other accounting principles
generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to issue a report on these financial statements based on our
review.
3. We conducted our review in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE) 241 0, “Review of
Interim Financial Information performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity” issued by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain
moderate assurance as to whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. A review is
limited primarily to inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures applied to financial data and
thus provide less assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do not
express an audit opinion.
4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
accompanying Statement of Unaudited Standalone Financial Results prepared in accordance with applicable
Indian Accounting Standards and other recognized accounting practices and policies, has not disclosed the
information required to be disclosed in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended, including the manner in which it is to be
disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.

Independent Auditor’s Review Report on consolidated unaudited quarterly financial results of the
Company Pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements)
Regulations, 2015
TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF
MANAKSIA LIMITED
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Unaudited Financial Results of Manaksia
Limited (“the Parent”) and its subsidiaries (the Parent and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the
Group”) for the quarter ended 30th September, 2025. and for the period from Is' April 2025 to 30,h September
2025, being submitted by the Parent pursuant to requirement of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing
Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended.
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Parent’s Management and approved by the Parent’s Board
of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in
Indian Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” (“Ind AS 34”), prescribed under Section 133
of the Companies Act, 2013, and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility
is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review.
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements (SRE)
2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity", issued
by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. A review of interim financial information consists of
making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying
analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in
accordance with Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we
would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not
express an audit opinion.
We also performed procedures in accordance with the circular issued by the SEBI under Regulation 33 (8) of
the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended, to the extent
applicable.
4. The Statement includes the results of the following entities:
a) Manaksia Limited
b) MINL Limited
c) Dynatech Industries Ghana Limited (Step-down Subsidiary)
d) Jebba Paper Mills Limited (Step- down Subsidiary)
e) Manaksia Ferro Industries Limited
f) Manaksia Overseas Limited
g) Mark Steels Limited (Step- down Subsidiary)
5. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above nothing has come
to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying statement, prepared in accordance with the
recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standard and other
accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed
in terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015,
as amended, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.
