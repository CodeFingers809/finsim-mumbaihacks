Note: 
As per Company's Placement Document dated December 09, 2024, the Company had estimated to utilize Rs 8,656.43 million for 
the aforementioned objects by Fiscal 2025. However, based on the management undertaking, the Company has utilized Rs 7,590.75 
million only as at the end of fiscal 2025, hence, there is a delay in the implementation schedule. This delay is on account of a delay 
in approval from the bank for repayment of loans and delay in regulatory approvals for other objects . 
  
However, the Placement Document further states that, “If the Net Proceeds are not utilized (in full or in part) for the Objects for 
the period stated above due to any reason, including (i) the timing of completion of the Issue; (ii) market conditions outsid e the 
control of our Company; and (iii) any other eco nomic, business and commercial considerations, the remaining Net Proceeds shall 
be utilized (in part or full) in subsequent periods in such manner as may be determined by our Company, in accordance with  
applicable laws.” 
 
^The Monitoring Agency has relied solely on the management undertaking as the Peer-reviewed I ndependent Chartered 
Accountant has not expressed an opinion on these.
