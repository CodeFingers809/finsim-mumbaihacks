Independent Auditor’s Report on Unaudited Standalone Quarterly and Year to Date 
Unaudited Standalone Financial Results of the Company Pursuant to the Regulation 33 
and 52 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, 
as amended 
Review Report to 
The Board of Directors of 
NHC Foods Limited 
We have reviewed the accompanying statement of unaudited standalone financial results 
(“the Statements”) of NHC Foods Limited (‘the Company”) for the quarter ended 30" 
September 2025 and the year to date from 15t April 2025 to 30" September 2025 (the 
"statement”) attached herewith, being submitted by the Company pursuant to the 
requirements of Regulation 33 and Regulation 52 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (the “Listing Regulations”). 
The company’s Management is responsible for the preparation of the Statement in 
accordance with the recognition and measurement principle laid down in Indian Accounting 
Standard 34, (Ind AS 34) “Interim Financial Reporting” prescribed under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 as amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 and 
52 of the Listing Regulations. The Statement has been approved by the Company’s Board of 
Directors. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410, “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity” issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. 
This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as 
to whether the Statement is free of material misstatement. A review of interim financial 
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and 
accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Standard on Auditing 
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all 
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit 
opinion.

4. Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us 
to believe that the accompanying Statement, prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standard (“Ind AS”) 
specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 as amended read with relevant rules 
issued thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, has not 
disclosed the information required to be disclosed in terms of the Listing Regulations, including 
the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains any material misstatement.

Independent Auditor’s Review Report on the Quarterly and Year to Date Unaudited Consolidated 
Financial Results of the Company Pursuant to the Regulation 33 and 52 of the SEBI (Listing 
Obligations and Disclosure Requirement s} Regulations, 2015, as amended 
Review Report to 
The Board of Directors 
NHC Foods Limited 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results of NHC 
Foods Limited (the "Holding Company") and its subsidiary (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries 
together referred to as "the Group"), for the quarter ended September 30, 2025 and year to date 
from April 1, 2025 to September 30, 2025 (the "Statement") attached herewith, being submitted 
by the Holding Company pursuant to the requirements of Regulation 33 and 52 of the SEBI (Listing 
Obligations  and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended (the "Listing 
Regulations”). 
2. The Holding Company's Management is responsible for the preparation of the Statement in 
accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in Indian Accounting 
Standard 34, (Ind AS 34) "Interim Financial Reporting" prescribed under Section 133 of the 
Companies Act, 20 13 as dmended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other 
accounting principles generally accepted in India and in compliance with Regulation 33 and 
52 of the listing Regulations. The Statement has been approved by the Holding Company’s Board 
of Directors. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements 
(SRE) 2410, "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the 
Entity” issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. This standard requires that we plan 
and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the Statement is free of material 
misstatement. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of 
persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review 
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with 
Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would 
become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not 
express an audit opinion. 
We also performed procedures in accordance with the Master Circular issued by the Securities and 
Exchange Board of India under Regulation 33(8) of the Listing Regulations, to the extent applicable. 
4. The Statement includes the results of the entities mentioned in Annexure |. 
5. Based on our review conducted and procedures performed as stated in paragraph 3 above 
and based on the consideration of the review reports of other auditors referred to in paragraph 7 
below, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement, 
prepared in accordance with recognition and measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid 
Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS’) specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 
2013, as amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in 
terms of the Listing Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it contains 
any material misstatement. 
6. The subsidiary are located outside India whose financial results and other financial information have 
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in their respective 
countries and which have been reviewed by other auditors under generally accepted auditin

standards applicable in their respective countries. The Holding Company’s management has 
converted the financial results of such subsidiary located outside India from accounting principles 
generally accepted in their respective countries to accounting principles generally accepted in India. 
We have reviewed these conversion adjustments made by the Holding Company’s management. Our 
conclusion in so far as it relates to the balances and affairs of such subsidiary located outside India is 
based on the report of other auditors and the conversion adjustments prepared by the management 
of the Holding Company and reviewed by us. 
. The accompanying Statement includes unaudited interim financial results and other unaudited 
financial information in respect of: 
e One foreign subsidiary, whose unaudited interim financial results and other unaudited financial 
information include total revenues of Rs. Nil, total net profit after tax of Rs. Nil and total 
comprehensive income is Rs. Nil for the quarter ended 30" September, 2025 
The unaudited interim financial results and other unaudited financial information of these subsidiary 
have not been reviewed by their auditors however that has been approved by the management and 
approved by the board of director of holding company, our conclusion on the Statement, in so far as it 
relates to the affairs of these subsidiary is based solely on such unaudited interim financial results and 
other unaudited financial information. According to the information and explanations given to us by the 
Management, these interim financial results are not material to the Group. 
Our conclusion on the Statement in respect of matters stated in para 7 above is not modified with 
respect to our reliance on the work done and the reports of the other auditors and the financial results 
certified by the Management.
