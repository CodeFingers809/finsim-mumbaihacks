DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS 
 
MODE OF DISPATCH OF FIRST AND FINAL CALL NOTICE 
 
In terms of the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act ”) read with the relevant rules made thereunder, 
the First and Final Call Notice is being sent in electronic mode to holders of Rights Equity Shares, whose e-mail 
address is registered with the Company or its Registrar and Tra nsfer Agent – MUFG Intime India Private 
Limited (Formerly Link Intime India Private Limited) (“RTA”) or the Depository Participant(s) as on the First 
and Final Call Record Date. The First and Final Call Notice along with the detailed instructions and payment slip 
are also available on the Company’s website at www.fusionfin.com. 
 
Physical copy of the First and Final Call Notice along with the  detailed instructions and payment slip are being 
sent to those Eligible Shareholders: 
 
a. who have not registered their e-mail address with the Company or its RTA or Depository Participant(s); or 
b. who have specifically registered their request for the hard copy of the same. 
 
PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS 
 
Please note that: 
 
a. Cash payment shall not be accepted. 
 
b. No part payment would be accepted, and part payment would be tr eated as non-payment which shall render 
the Rights Equity Shares, including the amount already paid thereon, liable to be forfeited in accordance with 
the provisions of the Act, the Articles of Association of the C ompany and the Letter of Offer. However, in 
relation to any payment made by a holder of the Rights Equity S hares pursuant to the First and Final Call, 
which is lesser than the aggregate amount payable by such holde r with respect to the Rights Equity Shares 
held by such holder as on the First and Final Call Record Date, our Board or a duly authorized Committee of 
the Board, may consider conversion of such lower number of Rights Equity Shares to be made fully paid-up, 
such that it is in proportion to the amount paid by such holder.  
 
(For example - If a shareholder holds 100 Rights Equity Shares on the First and Final Call Record Date, 
the aggregate amount payable by such holder pursuant to the First and Final Call will be ₹ 6,550/-. If such 
holder makes a payment of ₹3,275/-, such holder will receive such number of fully paid-up Equity Shares 
converted in proportion to the payment made i.e., 50 fully paid-up Equity Shares. Partly paid-up equity 
shares in respect of which the First and Final Call payable remains unpaid may be forfeited, in accordance 
with the provisions of the Act, the Articles of Association of the Company and the Letter of Offer.) 
 
c. Payments made using third party bank accounts are liable to be rejected and the Company and the Registrar 
for the Issue - MUFG Intime India Private Limited (Formerly Link Intime India Private Limited) (“Registrar 
to the Issue”) shall rely on the self-certification of the transaction in this regard.

and Final Call Record Date or short payment made by an Eligible  Shareholder (in case the same cannot be 
adjusted towards payment of First and Final Call Money), will be refunded as per following methods:
