shareholders, in respect of all shareholders’ resolutions. However, it has been observed that the 
participation by the public non-institutional shareholders/retail shareholders is at a negligible level.

entities in India. This necessitates registration on various ESPs and maintenance of multiple user IDs 
and passwords by the shareholders.

decided to enable e-voting to all the demat account holders, by way of a single login credential, 
through their demat accounts / websites of Depositories/ Depository Participants. Demat account 
holders would be able to cast their vote without having to register again with the ESPs, thereby, not 
only facilitating seamless authentication but also enhancing ease and convenience of participating in 
e-voting process.  
 
iii. In terms of SEBI circular no. SEBI/HO/CFD/CMD/CIR/P/2020/242 dated December 9, 2020 on e-Voting 
facility provided by Listed Companies, Individual shareholders holding securities in demat mode are 
allowed to vote through their demat account maintained with Depositories and Depository

III. Other information:  
 
(1) Reasons of loss or inadequate profits: 
 
As the members are aware that the Lloyd Dynamowerke Gmbh & Co.KG (LDW) is a step down subsidiary 
of the Company set up in Germany. LDW was facing serious financial and operational challenges since the 
financial year 2011-12 after the economic slowdown in Europe. The Company infused capital from time to 
time and in the process its Balance Sheet exposure in the form of investment in LDW increased 
substantially up to ₹224.47 crores. LDW recorded huge losses in the year 2012-13 and 2013-14 and 
ultimately filed for insolvency in a German court of law. As a result of the investment in LDW, KECL 
experienced gradually incremental severe shortage of working capital, which led to low capacity utilization 
and thereby resulting into losses for the earlier financial years. 
 
After the administrator was appointed to liquidate LDW, KECL lost total control over LDW and hence the 
investment was substantially impaired in the year 2014-15. Accumulation of operating losses continued 
weak business environment and funding of LDW together affected Company’s operation. In order to 
address the whole issue, during the year 2014-15 the Company drew up a financial reorganization 
planning consultation with financial lenders (lenders). The lenders formed a Joint Lenders Forum (JLF) and 
corrective action plan was drawn up in mutual consultation with JLF members and Company.  
 
Since then the Company has taken several initiatives to increase its profitability and to explore new 
opportunities of achieving cost reduction and price competitiveness. Infusion of substantial funds in the 
Company corroborates his commitment to the Company. His varied experience and exposure has come 
very handy to the business in these difficult times. 
 
(2) Steps taken or proposed to be taken for improvement: 
 
As mentioned earlier, the Company has already taken measures for improving its working, such as cutting 
costs at all levels, reduction in manpower, product development, improving working capital management 
etc., and the performance is getting improved. On the other hand, the Company has disposed off those 
assets of the Company and other vacant lands available which had no value to the operations of the 
Company. The Company has repaid its term loans and working capital loans borrowed under Joint Lenders 
Forum (JLF) from consortium banks / financial institutions.

With the suggestions above, the Company expects to improve the productivity and margin also.

mentioned in the Board’s report under corporate governance attached to 78th annual report which is

Further, the effective capital of the Company is negative and as required under Section II of part II, 
schedule V to the Companies Act, 2013, the approval of members of the Company is sought by way of 
special resolution.
