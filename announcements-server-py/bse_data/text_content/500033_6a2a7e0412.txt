Our
Founder
Our Founder 
Shri. Navalkamal Kundanmal Firodia (1910  - 1997)
Auto Rickshaw demonstrated to 
India's first Prime Minister, Pandit 
Jawaharlal Nehru
Shri Navalmal Kundanmal Firodia, a freedom fighter, 
industrialist, and philanthropist was a visionary ahead 
of his time. Holding degrees in Science and Law, he 
combined intellect with ethics, shaping his approach 
to business and social responsibility. He actively 
participated in Mahatma Gandhi’s Non-Cooperation 
and Quit India movements. Foreseeing India’s 
impending independence, he chose to leave his legal 
career to establish Jaya Hind Industries in 1948. 
He envisioned a motorized rickshaw to replace the 
traditional bicycle rickshaw and coined the term 
autorickshaw for this revolutionary innovation. In 1948, he 
also introduced the three-wheeler Tempo, which 
became synonymous with light commercial vehicles in 
India. Founded in 1958, Force Motors continues to carry 
forward Shri N.K. Firodia’s pioneering legacy and vision 
that transformed urban mobility in India.
