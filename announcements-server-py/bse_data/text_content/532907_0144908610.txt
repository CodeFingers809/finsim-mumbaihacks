Independent Auditor's Review Report on the Quarterly and Year to Date Unaudited Standalone
Financial Results of the Company Pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as amended
To
The Boald of Directors of
IL&FS Engineering and Construction Company Limited
We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Unaudited Standalone FinancialResults of IL&FS
Engineering and Construction Company Limited ('the Company') for the quarter ended
Septerlber 30,2025 and year to date fi'om April 01,2025 to September 30,2.025, ('tlre Statemeltt'),
attached herewith, being subrrritted by the Company pursllant to the requirements of Regulation 33 of
the SEBI (Listing Obligatiorrs ancl Disclosule Requirerrents) Regulatious, 2015 as amended ('Listing
Regulations').
This Staternent, which is the responsibility ofthe Cornpany's Management and approved by the Board
of Directors of the Cornpany ol1 November 14, 2025, has been prepared in accordance with the
recogrrition and measurerneut principles laid clown in Iudian Accountittg Starrdard 34 ("lnd AS 34)
"lrrterinr Firrancial Repolting" prescribed under Sectiorr 133 of the Companies Act2013, as ametrded,
read with lelevant rules issued thereunder and other accouuling principles generally accepted in Irrdia.
Oul respolrsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based on oLrr review.
We conducted our review of the Staternent in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements
(SRE) 2410 'Review of lnterim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the
Entity', issLred by the Institute of Chartered Accor,rrrtants of India. T'his Standard lequires that we plan
anci perform the review to obtairr rnoclerate assuranoe as to whether the Statemerrt is fl"ee of material
rrrisstaternent. A review of interir.n financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of
persotls responsible for financial aud accountirlg l'natters, arrd applying analytical and othel review
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope tlran an audit conducted irr accordauce with
Standards on Ar"rcliting and consequently does not enable us to obtain assLlrance that we would become
aware of all significant matters that might be identilLed in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express
an audit opinion.
Material uncertainty relatecl to going Concern:
Attention is ir-rvited to Note 5 to the Statement regarding continued losses, erosion of net wofth as at
the period end, and significant reduction in the Compauy's ir.rcorne from operations and other matters
cletailed in the said paragrapli. These events and conditions indicate a material uncerlainty which cast
a significant doubt on the Cornpany's ability to corrtirtre as a going coucenl, and therefore it may not
be able to realise its assets turd discharge its liabilities includiug potential liabilities in the nomal
collrse of business. The ability ol'the Comparry to contir.rlle as a going concern is solely dependent on
the finalisatiou and approval of the resolution process, which is not wholly withirr the control of the
Company.
The Management of the Conipany has prepaled these finarrcial results on going concern basis
considering status o1'process initiated by the Boald zrncl lnteritn Oldet's of NCLAT.

Company'), ald its subsidiaries (inclLrding the Cornpany). The standalone financial results of
the Company for the periocl endecl Septerrber 30, 2025 do not include adjustments, if arry, that
may arise on accolllrt of the ongoing irrvestigations by the investigating agencies, Regulatory
Author.ities ancl other agencies, as the lnaltagelnellt, at this juncture, do not foresee any
acljustments to be macle in these financial results of the Cornpany as a result of investigations.
b) Note 6 relatilg to 1on-recognition of interest expense on borrowiugs availed by the Company,
pursr-rant to the Irrterirn Order and the Judgement passed by NCLAT specifying October 15,
2018 as cr"rt off clate for irritiation of resolutiou process, of Rs.22,901 Lakhs (excluding penal /

Indepenclent Auditor's Review Report on the Quarterly and Year to Date Unaudited Consolidated
Financial Results of the Company Pursuant to the Regulation 33 of the SDBI (Listing Obligations and
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, as alnended
To
The Board of Directors of
IL&FS Engineering and Construction Company Limited
We have reviewed the acconrpanying Statenrent of UnaLrdited Consolidated Financial Results of
IL&FS Engineering and Construction Company Limited ('the Holding Company'), its
subsidiaries and unincorporated joint ventures (the Flolding Company, its subsidiaries and
tunincorporated joint ventllres together referred to as "the Group") for the qllarter ended September
30,2025 ancl year to date from April 01,2025 to September 30,2025 ('the Statement'), attached
herewith, being sr-rbmitted by the Holding Company pursuant to the requirements of Regr-rlation 33 of
the SEBI (Listing Obligatiorrs and Disclosr"rre Requirements) Regulations,2015 as amended ('Listing
Regulations').
This Staternent which is the responsibility of the Holding Company's Management and approved by
tlre Board of Directors of the Holding Company or.r November 14, 2025, has been prepared in
accordance with the recognition and rneasuremerrt principles laid down in Indian Accounting
Standard 34 ("lnd AS 34) "lnterirr Financial Repofting" prescribed under Section 133 of the
Companies Act2013, as amerrded, read rvith relevant rules issued thereunder and otlier accounting
prirrciples genelally accepted in Inclia. Our r"esporrsibility is to express a conclusiotr on the Statement
based on oul review.
We conducted our review'of thc Statement irr accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements
(SRE) 2410 'Review of Interim Financial Inforrnation Perforrned by the Independent Auditor of the
Eutity', issued by tl-re Institute of Chartered Accountants of lndia. This Standard requires that we plan
and perfonn the review to obtain moderate assllral-lce as to whether the Statement is free of material
rrrisstateurerrt. A review of iuterinr finaucial information cousists of making inquiries, prirnarily of
persons responsible fbr fiuancial and accolrrrting matters, and applying analytical and other review
procedures. A review is sLrbstantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
Standalds on Auditing and cousequently does not enable us to obtain assllrance that we would become
aware of allsignificant matters that rnight be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express
an audit opinion.

Basis for Qualified Conclusion:
The unaudited consolidated financial results do not include the financial results and other financial
infonnation of an overseas entity "Maytas Irrfra Saudi Arabia Company" for tlie reasolls stated in
Note 10. We are unable to cornrnent on the impact, if atry, on the financial results for the respective
periods in the absence of the financial information of the said foreign sLrbsidiary.
Material uncertainty related to going concern:
Attention is invited to Note 5 to the Statement regarding continued losses, erosion of net worth as at
the period end, and significant reduction irr the Holding Company's il-tcome from operations and other
matters detailed in the saicl paragraph. These events and conditions indicate a material uncertainty
which cast a significant doubt on the Holding Cornpauy's ability to coutitrlte as a going cottcerlt, atrd
therefore it may not be able to realise its assets aud discharge its liabilities inclLrding potential
liabilities iu the lorural course of business. The ability of the Holdirrg Company to contilrlte as a going
coltcent is solely dependent on the finalisation and approval of the resolution process, which is not
wholly within the control of the I-lolding Company.
The Management of the Holding Company has prepared these financial results on going concern basis
considering status of process irritiated by the Boarcl and lnterim Orders o1'NCLAT.
Our conclusiot.t is trot rnodified in respect of this lnatter
Emphasis of Matter:

a) Note 4 regarding ongoing investigations by Serious Fraud Investigation Office of Ministry of
Company Affairs (SFIO), Enforcernerrt Directorate (ED) and other regulators / agencies

orrgoing investigations by tlre investigating agencies, RegLrlatory ALrthorities and other

Qualified Conclusion
Based on our review conductecl and procedures perfonned as stated in paragrapl-r 3 above, except for

reviewed by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board of Directors of the Company in their
meetings held on November L4,2025.

issued thereunder.
(4) lnvestigationsetc.byRegulatory/lnvestigativeAgencies:
Consequent to adverse developments at lnfrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Limited ("lL&FS")
and lL&FS group level, as stated in earlier years, various regulatory authorities and investigative agencies
have initiated their proceedings and are seeking information from the Company as part of their
investigations since 2018-19 onwards. The Company and the present management are cooperating with
the respective authorities and are submitting the information as sought from time to time.
Further, as per the directions of the Reconstituted Board of lL&FS, forensic audit by an independent firm
was initiated for select entities including the Company. The forensic auditors submitted their final report
relating to the Company in May 2021 detailing certain potential anomalies in the financial statements
and operations of the Company. The report has been hosted on the Company's website and also
submitted to the stock exchanges, Serious Fraud lnvestigation Office (SFIO), etc. Based on the said report,
SFIO and Enforcement Directorate sought additional information from the Company which the Company
has submitted from time to time. The report pertaining to the Company has been submitted by SFIO to
the Central Government. The MCA, in turn, has provided the summary of charges to IL&FS with certain
directions to take cognizance/actions in the matter. The adjustments, if any, arising out these
investigations would be known upon completion of investigation process by respective authorities /
agencies and hence, are not determinable at this stage.
(s) Going Concern:
The Company has incurred accumulated loss of Rs. 3,61,156 Lakhs as at September 30, 2025 (As at
March 31, 2025 Rs. 3,60,037 Lakhs). The Company's net worth is fully eroded and the current liabilities
exceed its current assets by Rs. 3,85,192 Lakhs as at the reporting date, existing projects being executed
by the Company are nearing completion / or approaching their end of term, which resulted in significant
reduction in the Company's operating revenue over the past three years. The Company has continued
to default in payment of various loans to the lenders of the Company, including borrowings from
promoter group entities.
As part of its initiatives for Resolution of lL&FS Group, the Reconstituted Board of Directors of lL&FS in
their reports to National Company Law Tribunal ("NCLT') categorized the Company under the Group
"Red" implying that the Company is unable to meet its contractual, statutory and debt obligations. The
National Company Law Appellate Tribunal ("NCLAT") vide its Order dated October 15, 2018 ("lnterim
Order") in the Company Appeal (AT) 346 of 2018, after taking into consideration the nature of the case,
stayed certain coercive and precipitate actions against lL&FS and its group companies including the
Company. The NCLAT vide its Judgement dated March 12,2020 accepted the resolution process and
revised resolution framework, including October 15, 2018 as date of initiation of resolution process of
lL&FS Group entities, (including the Company) and crystallization of claims as of that date i.e. cut-off
date with no interest, additional interest, penal charges or other similar charges to accrue after the said
ate. Accordingly, the Company is currently not settling liabilities existing prior to O
Chattorsd
the cutoff date to its Financial Creditors and the Operational Creditors.

(8)
Adverse developments in promoter group entities impacted the operations of the Company and also
resulted in cancellation/ termination/suspension/foreclosure of certain contracts with customers. The
Reconstituted Board and the management ofthe Company have taken various steps to continue the
operations at present level during the period as per the resolution process framework accepted by the
Hon'ble NCLAT.
ln line with the said framework, the Reconstituted Board is in the process of finalizing a comprehensive
approach to manage the current situation including sale of existing equity share holding by lL & FS
Group. ln this process, the Reconstituted Board, as part of resolution process for the Company, has
invited expression of interest for acquiring the equity stake in the Company. ln January 2022, a bid was
received from an unincorporated Consortium which was subjected to challenge through counter bid
under a Swiss Challenge method. The successful bid was submitted to the Committee of Creditors (CoC)
for approval and has been duly approved by the CoC during the year. The bid will now be placed before
Justice D.K. Jain (Retd.) for approval, followed by submission to the National Company Law Tribunal
(NCLr).
The ability of the Company to continue as going concern is solely dependent on positive outcome of
resolution process initiated by the Reconstituted Board which would restructure the debt and resume
normal operations. The above financial results have been prepared on a going concern basis considering
the status of the resolution process and steps taken by the Reconstituted Board.
lnterest Expense:
As detailed in Note 5 above, NCLAT vide its Judgement dated March L2, 2O2O accepted the revised
resolution framework process including October 15, 2018 as date of initiation of resolution process of

date with no interest, additional interest, penal charges or other similar charges to accrue after the said
cut-off date.

been accrued and recognized in its financial results in accordance with the applicable lndian Accounting

months ended September 30, 2025. Aggregate amount of interest expense not recognized as at
September 30,2025 is Rs. 2,84,896 Lakhs approximately (excluding penal interest etc.)

Court of Delhi. The carrying values of assets and liabilities relating to the project was Rs. 25,263 Lakhs
[net] which comprises of interest receivable, trade receivable, retention money, mobilization advance
and interest payable on said advance. Considering the favorable Order as at the date of reporting, the
