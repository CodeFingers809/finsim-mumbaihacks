Auditor's Responsibility 
5. Pursuant to requirement of the Regulations, as referred to in paragraph 2 above, it is our responsibility to express limited 
assurance in the form of a conclusion as to whether anything has come to our attention that cause us to believe that: 
a. the details included in Section I of the accompanying statement regarding book value of the assets offered as security 
against NCDs of the Trust outstanding as at 30 September 2025 are, in all material respects, not in agreement with 
the unaudited standalone financial results of the Trust, underlying books of account and other relevant records and 
documents maintained by the Trust for the quarter and half year ended 30 September 2025 which have been 
subjected to limited review pursuant to Regulation 23 of the SEBI ((Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations, 
2014 (as amended) and SEBI Master Circular SEBI/HO/DDHS-PoD-2/P/CIR/2025/102 dated 11 July 2025, and that 
the calculation thereof is not arithmetically accurate. 
b. the details included in Section II of the accompanying statement regarding compliance with financial covenants 
relating to consolidated net debt to enterprise value as stated in Paragraph (ix) of Clause (d) of schedule Ill of the 
DSTD of NCDs of the Trust outstanding as at 30 September 2025, is not in compliance with the terms of aforesaid 
DSTD and the amounts used in computation of such financial covenants are not in agreement with the unaudited 
consolidated financial results of the Trust, underlying books of account and other relevant records and documents 
maintained by the Trust for the quarter and half year ended 30 September 2025, and that the calculation thereof is 
not arithmetically accurate. 
6. The columns with respect to market value of assets (columns K to 0) of the Section I of accompanying Statement are not 
covered by this certificate and no procedures have been performed by us on such information as per our terms of 
engagement. 
7. The unaudited standalone financial results and unaudited consolidated financial results for the quarter and half year ended 
30 September 2025, referred to in paragraph 5 (a) and 5 (b) above, have been reviewed by us, on which we have 
expressed an unmodified conclusion vide our report dated 14 November 2025. • Our review of unaudited standalone 
financial results and unaudited consolidated financial results was conducted in accordance with the Standard on Review 
Engagements (SRE) 2410, Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ('the ICAI'). This Standard requires that we plan and perform the 
review to obtain moderate assurance as to whether the financial information is free of material misstatement. A review is 
limited primarily to inquiries of the Trust personnel and analytical procedures applied to the financial data and thus, 
provides less assurance than an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we did not express an audit 
opinion. 
8. We conducted our examination of the Statement in accordance with the Guidance Note on Reports or Certificates for 
Special Purposes {Revised 2016) ('the Guidance Note') issued by the ICAI. The Guidance Note requires that we comply 
with the ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics issued by the ICAI. 
9. We have complied with the relevant applicable requirements of the Standard on Quality Control (SOC) 1, Quality Control 
for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information, and Other Assurance and Related Services 
Engagements, issued by the ICAI.

Debenture Trustees dated 13 August 2025 (Cont'd) 
10. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than 
for, a reasonable assurance engagement; and consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance 
engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance 
engagement been performed. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of 
the areas where a material misstatement of the subject matter information is likely to arise. We have performed the 
following procedures in relation to the accompanying Statement: 
Section I of the accompanying Statement - Statement on book values of the assets offered as security: 
a) Verified the details of security cover ratio criteria from the DSTD in respect of listed NCDs of the Trust outstanding as 
at 30 September 2025; 
b) Obtained the list and value of assets offered as security against NCDs of the Trust outstanding as at 30 September 
2025; 
c) Traced the book values of assets mentioned in columns A to J from the Statement to the unaudited standalone financial 
results, underlying books of account and other relevant records and documents maintained by the Trust for the quarter 
and half year ended 30 September 2025, and which have been subjected to limited review as mentioned in paragraph 
7 above; 
d) Traced the principal amount of the NCDs and other debt outstanding as at 30 September 2025 to the unaudited 
standalone financial results, underlying books of account and other relevant records and documents maintained by the 
Trust as at and for the quarter and half year ended 30 September 2025; 
e) Obtained necessary representations from the Investment Manager of the Trust; and 
f) Verified the arithmetical accuracy of the Statement. 
Section II of the accompanying Statement - Statement on financial covenant on 'Consolidated net debt to 
enterprise value': 
a) Verified the computation of financial covenants in relation to 'Consolidated Net Debt to Enterprise value' as mentioned 
in the Section II of the Statement as on 30 September 2025 and ensured that it is in accordance with the basis of 
computation given in the DSTD, and the amounts used in such computation for 'consolidated net debt' have been 
accurately extrc1cted from unaudited consolidated financial results , underlying books of account and other relevant 
records and documents maintained by the Trust for the quarter and half year ended 30 September 2025 and also traced 
the enterprise value as at 30 September 2025 from the valuation report of the independent registered valuer appointed 
by the Trust in accordance with SEBI (Infrastructure Investments Trusts) Regulations, 2014, as amended, used for 
calculation of enterprise value in consolidated net debt to enterprise value ratio; 
b) Obtained necessary representations from the Investment Manager of the Trust; and 
c) Verified the arithmetical accuracy of the Statement. 
Conclusion 
11 . Based on our examination and the procedures performed as per paragraph 10 above, evidences obtained, and the 
information and explanations given to us, along with the representations provided by the Investment Manager of the 
Trust, nothing has come to our attention that cause us to believe that the: 
a. the details mentioned in Section I of the accompanying statement regarding book value of the assets offered as 
security against NCDs of the Trust outstanding as at 30 September 2025, are in all material respects, not in 
agreement with the unaudited standalone financial results of the Trust, underlying books of account and other 
relevant records and documents maintained by the Trust for the quarter and half year ended 30 September 2025 
which have been subject to limited review pursuant to Regulation 23 of the SEBI ((Infrastructure Investment Trusts)
