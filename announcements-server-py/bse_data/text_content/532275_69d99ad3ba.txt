The figures for the previous period have been regrouped and re-arranged, wherever necessary, to make them comparable with the current period.
The Company has given Interest Free Loans to a party for amounting to Rs. 258.46 Lakhs for which term sheets and other documents are in process of regularisation.
The Management of the Company has decided to reduce its focus of Wellness activities and concentrate on Films, Media and TV Channel business. Accordingly, it has been decided to re-
structure the Company’s agreements with two parties to whom advances/ security deposits have been given so as to utilize the resources in a more effect ive manner for developing the
Entertainment business. Accordingly, discussions are underway for implementation of the same. 
i. In one of the agreements in the earlier years, the Company had entered into a Revenue Sharing Agreement for occupying commercial spaces of SKM Real In fra Limited (formerly SKM
Fabrics (Andheri) Limited) (SKM). As per this Agreement, the Company had given substantial advance/ deposit to SKM Real Infra Ltd (SKM) in return for o ccupying and utilizing the Raaj
Chamber development of SKM. This was in line with the Wellness business component of the Company. The closing balance of the said deposit as on 30th Sept ember 2025 is Rs.
2,218.28 lakhs which is higher than the space occupied by the Company. SKM has gone into Resolution under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC). Accor dingly, the Company has
filed claim with the IP for an amount of Rs. 6376.71 Lakhs. The Company has not recognised interest income neither the Company has provided for rentals payable to the said company for
the premises being used in lieu of the unreceived interest income. 
ii. In respect of the other party the Company had given a security deposit of Rs. 1500 Lakhs to Shree Ram Urban Infrastructure Limited (SRUIL) under Memo randum of Understanding for
establishment and running of wellness center in the upcoming Palais Royale project of SRUIL. However, SRUIL has since gone into Resolution under the IBC and the fate of this MOU has
become uncertain. The Company is making efforts to find a satisfactory solution and is hopeful that equivalent values will be recovered in due course.Based on conservative approach, the
Company has decided to recognise the interest income only on receipt basis.
The Company has not carried out actuarial valuation as per the recommendations of Ind AS 19 issued by ICAI, and instead provided for Gratuity on accrual basis as per Management
Estimates. The management is of the opinion that the provision created in the books is sufficient considering the number of employees it has provided the same in current period on ad-hoc
basis.
The Company has not complied with the provision of maintaining edit log during the current quarter as required under Companies Act.

Review Report to
The Board of Directors
Landmarc Leisure Corporation Limited
We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Unaudited Financial Results of Landmarc
Leisure Corporation Lirnited ("the Company") for the quarter and half year ended September
30,2025, being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 33 and 52
of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 ("the
Regulation") as amended, including relevant circulars issued by the SEBI from time to time
("Listing Regulations").
This Statement which is the responsibility of the Company's Management and approved by the
Company's Board of Directors, has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and
measurement principles laid down in Accounting Standard for Interim Financial Reporting (Ind
AS 34), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with relevant rules issued
thereunder and other accounting principles generally accepted h India and Regulation 33 and 52
of the Listing Regulations. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Statement based
on our review.
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review
Engagements (SRE) 2410 'Review of Interim Financial InJormation Performed by the
Independent Auditor of the Entity', issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
This standard requires that we plan and perform the review to obtain moderate assurance as to
whether the Statement is free from material misstatement. A review of interim financial
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and
accounting matters and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope that an audit is conducted in accordance with the Standards on
Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013 and consequently does not
enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might
be identified in an audit. We have not performed an audit and accordingly, we do not express an
audit opinion.
Basis for Oualified Conclusion
1. Attention is invited to Note No. 2 of Unaudited Financial Results of the Compary which states
that the Company has given Interest-free Loans to a party amounting to Rs. 258.19 Lakhs for
which term sheet and other doc in process of regularization thereby havingg Ass

consequential impact on Loss of the Company for the quarter and half year ended 306
September 2025and Loars to the above extent.
2. Aftention is invited to Note No.3(i) of Unaudited Financial Results of the Company
regarding non-provision for doubtful debts advance/deposit given to a party amounting to
Rs. 2,21,8.28 Lakhs, the said Company has gone into Resolution under the Insolvency and
Bankruptcy Code (IBC), thereby understating the Loss for the quarter and half year ended
30s September 2025 to the said extent.
3. Attention is invited to Note No. 3(ii) of Unaudited Financial Results of the Company
regatding non-provision for doubfful Security deposit given by the Company and non-
availability of confirmatioru as the said Company has gone into Liquidation and liquidator
has been appointed amounting to Rs. 1500 Lakhs, thereby understating the Loss for the
quarter and half year ended 30s September 2025 to the said extent.
4. Attention is invited to Note No. 4 of Unaudited Financial Results wherein the Company has not
carried out Actuarial valuation as per the recommendations of lnd AS 15 "Employee Benefits"
issued by the lnstitute of Chartered Accountants of India and instead provided for Gratuity on
accrual basis as per Management Estimates. The amount of shortfall in such provision is
currently unascertainable since the Actuarial Valuation v/as not carried out. Horvever, the
management is of the opinion that the provision created in the books is sufficient considering the
number of employees.
5. Attention is invited to Note No.5 of Unaudited Financial Results of the Company which
states that the Company has neither enabled edit log nor maintained audit hail as required
to be maintained from 1st April 2024 as required vide notification of Ministry of Company
Affairs thereby leading to non-compliance and penalty which is presently unascertainable.
Oualified Conclusion
Based on our review conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention except as stated above
that causes us to believe that the accompanying statement of unaudited financial results prepared in
accordance with applicable Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the
Companies Act,2013 as amended, read with relevant rules issued thereunder and other accounting
principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in
terms of the Listing Regulations, including the manner in which it is to be disclosed, or that it
contains any material misstatement.
