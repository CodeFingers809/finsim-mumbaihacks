Shivalik Bimetal Controls Limited 
Q2 & H1FY2026 Earnings Webinar Transcript 
Thursday, November 13th, 2025: 4:00 PM IST 
Speakers from the Management: 
1. Mr. Sumer Ghumman- Whole-time Director 
2. Mr. Rajeev Ranjan- CFO 
3. Mr. Kanav Anand- Head of Sales & Marketing 
 
 
Management (Sumer): 
Okay, good afternoon everyone. Our performance in the first half of Financial Year 26 shows the 
strength of our business model and the discipline with which we are executing our long-term 
strategy. Despite a broadly stable volume environment, total volumes contracted only marginally 
by 0.9%. We delivered strong earnings momentum, with Profit After Tax up 26.3% in H1 FY26. 
This outcome reflects a healthy combination of margin expansion and operating leverage. Gross 
margin improved by 296 basis points and consolidated EBITDA margin rose 305 basis points year-
on-year, evidence of our focus on pricing, product mix and cost control. Earnings per share 
increased to ₹8.22, reaffirming the quality and sustainability of our profitability. 
Regionally, we continue to see solid traction. In India, shunt sales grew 25.23% in Q2, driven by 
robust demand from smart meter and industrial sectors. Across Asia, excluding India, sales 
climbed 38.5% as we deepened customer engagement and expanded into new accounts. These 
gains more than offset temporary softness in certain export markets. 
In the Americas and Europe, shunt volumes were impacted primarily by timing and channel 
recalibration rather than any structural weakness. Several customers moderated call-offs to 
balance inventories after earlier builds, while a few OEMs deferred orders as part of annual pricing 
and design approval cycles. We view these effects as transitory. Feedback from our global 
customers remains positive, and the underlying demand pipeline for precision resistors and 
assemblies remains strong. 
As these customers rebalance and resume normal ordering, we expect our momentum to 
stabilise and inventories to return to more appropriate levels through the second half of the year.

Looking ahead, the outlook remains encouraging. Our end-markets – smart metering, industrial 
automation and mobility electronics – continue to offer multi-year growth visibility. 
We are focused on extending our leadership in high-value assemblies, improving cash 
conversion, and accelerating both forward and backward integration initiatives that deepen 
customer partnerships and strengthen margin quality. 
Thank you for joining us this afternoon. We’ll… over to you, Shankhini. I think we were supposed to 
introduce first and we’ve gone the other way around, so you can do the introduction part now. 
 
Moderator (Shankhini – Dickenson IR): 
No problem. Thanks, Sumer, and thank you for those opening remarks. 
Welcome everybody to Shivalik Bimetal Controls Limited’s Q2–H1 FY2026 earnings webinar 
produced by Elevease. I’m Shankhini, Director – Investor Relations from Dickenson, and I’ll be 
moderating our call today. 
Joining us from Shivalik’s management team are: 
• Mr. Sumer Ghumman, Whole-time Director, 
• Mr. Kanav Anand, Head of Sales and Marketing, and 
• Mr. Rajeev Ranjan, Chief Financial Officer. 
Please note that this conference is being recorded and that some statements in this call may be 
forward-looking, based on current expectations and subject to risks that could cause results to 
differ materially. 
You can download Shivalik’s investor deck and press release from the links in the community 
chat, or from the Company’s website or the NSE directly. 
Perfect, great. We’ll start with the first participant. The first participant will be Deepan Sankara. 
Deepan, your line is unmuted; you can go ahead and ask your question. 
 
Q&A 
Deepan: 
Hello, hello. Am I audible? 
Moderator: 
Yes, Deepan, go ahead, please ask your question.

Deepan: 
Yeah, thanks a lot for the opportunity. Firstly, from my side, congratulations on a strong set of 
numbers. 
The only thing we wanted to understand is: volume growth has been muted for a couple of 
quarters now, both in shunts and also bimetals. What are the strategies we are adopting to see 
improvement in volume growth over H2, and how do we look at the outlook for FY27? 
Management (Kanav): 
Yeah. On the volume side, if you see, the market globally has been a little muted, especially in the 
western part of the world. That’s why our push is more towards, as Sumer was saying, moving into 
assemblies to add more value. 
We expect that in Q3 and Q4 of this financial year we’ll start seeing more value addition for us, 
which should help push volumes closer to our expectations. Additionally, we have added some 
new accounts into our customer base. Currently what we are seeing is pilot sampling and sample 
lots going out, which should convert into ramped-up commercial supplies in the coming quarters. 
That should further increase volumes for us. 
Deepan: 
Okay. And what is the key reason for the strong gross margin improvement? Is it product mix 
change or raw material prices going down? 
Management (Sumer): 
Raw material pricing does not really have a very strong effect on our margins, mainly because 
there is a complete pass-through of costs. So that doesn’t have a major impact. 
What we have been talking about in the past is that we have been going into forward-integration 
initiatives, which have already begun, and we have moved into more value-added processes. For 
example, if we had a large customer account where we were supplying materials in strip form, 
that has now moved more into components. 
Our entire development and marketing strategy has been oriented towards higher value-add 
products, and that is what we are now seeing converting into numbers. So although you will see a 
lower growth in the top line, you will continue to see an improvement in the bottom line because 
of those products. 
Deepan: 
Okay, thanks a lot and all the best. 
Management: 
Thanks for your question.

Moderator: 
Our next question will be from the line of Dhruv Jain. Dhruv, your line is unmuted; you can go 
ahead and ask your question. 
Dhruv: 
Hey, thanks for the opportunity. In the last six months we’ve seen multiple headwinds in our end-
markets, but you also mentioned the outlook for the second half looks better. 
I think in the last earnings call you had mentioned that you’re looking at 12–15% topline growth for 
the full year. Now if I just do a back-calculation, it basically means that for the second half of the 
year you’ll have to deliver anywhere between 16–20% topline growth. 
So I just wanted to understand if that still holds true – does the double-digit growth for the full year 
still hold – or do you think that’s going to be more of an FY27 sort of phenomenon? 
Management (Sumer): 
We were absolutely on track based on our last call. What happened was that a large portion of our 
customer base, and a large portion of our expected growth, was to come from our customers in 
the US based on the forecasts we had. We had some optimism from there. 
Now what we are seeing with this 50% tariff that’s been placed on India is that we have not lost 
any business because of that – it’s impossible for our existing customers to immediately start 
buying from alternate sources. So we have not lost business, but what we’ve seen is a reduction 
in orders and in forecasts because nobody wants to carry extra inventory and pay that 50%. 
So they’ve come down to buying as little as possible, and they are also forecasting lower volumes, 
assuming that the markets are not going to be that great in the coming months in the US. We’ve 
seen certain reductions there. 
If we hadn’t experienced that, we feel that in the last quarter we could have had at least 2–3% 
higher growth. Which means that in order to achieve double-digit growth for the full year, instead 
of needing ~16% in the second half, the requirement would have been closer to maybe 12–13%. 
That sounds more achievable with the current forecast and expectations that we have. 
So, although by the end of the year we were earlier expecting double-digit growth of somewhere 
between 12–15%, that now comes down by maybe 4–5%. It could end at just a high single-digit or 
maybe touch double-digits. It’s hard to say. We do still have optimism for the second half of the 
year. 
Dhruv: 
Sure. And my second question is on margins. You mentioned the value-addition aspect, and in the 
last four-five quarters we’ve seen consistent improvement in margins. I just want to understand: 
is this the optimal level of margins that we should work with on a sustainable basis, or is there 
room for further margin improvement from here?

Management (Sumer): 
With our current strategy of focusing development activities mostly in areas where there is more 
value addition, the development time increases. Anything that has a higher value-add obviously 
means there is a technical barrier or difficulty in developing it, so sometimes it can take longer. 
But once it is developed, it has a substantial impact on the bottom line. 
To give you some perspective: if you’re doing extremely small-size resistors – about 80% of all our 
new development in the last 24 months has been related to small resistors – as more and more of 
that business converts, we will continue to see those developments converting into regular 
business. 
We expect that before this margin expansion plateaus, we will continue to see, for a few more 
quarters, this percentage improving further because as we speak these things are being 
converted. Today we might be getting 10% of a certain business; in a year’s time they may give us 
20–30%. 
So over the next two-three year horizon, we should continue to see that improvement in margins, 
because all the developments we’re doing are mostly higher value-add. They may not have a very 
huge impact on top line – say they add, over a three-year period, maybe ₹40–50 crore to top line – 
but they add a very substantial amount of value, and that makes the overall numbers look really 
good. 
So part of our strategy has always been to focus on such initiatives. 
Dhruv: 
So, just to understand this better, this 23% EBITDA margin – realistically, say over the next four 
quarters – can it improve by about 200 basis points? 
Management (Sumer): 
It’s possible. We feel that in a three-year horizon, it is possible to take it up another couple of 
percentage points beyond that. 
Of course, during that time if we feel there is a high topline opportunity for us to add a certain 
product which can add substantial revenue but at the cost of margin, then the overall numbers 
may look different. If such a project gets added, that’s a different story. But as of now, like-for-like 
with our existing business, we do expect to see further improvement. 
Dhruv: 
Sure. And my last question is on new products – the PCBA offering and the busbars. I remember 
last quarter you had mentioned that from the fourth quarter onwards we’ll start to see some 
revenue coming from the PCBA side. Just want to understand: are we on track for that, and any 
guidance you’d want to give on that for FY27 for the full year in terms of new product contribution?

Management (Moderator handing over): 
I think, Kanav, you can take the PCBA update along with the busbar. 
Management (Kanav): 
Yes. As we mentioned last time, Q4 seems to be the time where we will start seeing some revenue 
generation from the PCBA assemblies, and we see that this has the potential to give us, at least in 
the near term – that is, next financial year – a topline of about ₹50–70 crore. 
So, to answer your question in a very simple way: yes, it’s on track as of now. The developments 
we had in mind are as per schedule. 
Moderator: 
Thanks for your question, Dhruv. 
Participants can raise their hands again for follow-ups and you’ll be rejoined into the queue. 
 
Moderator: 
Our next question will be from the line of Ayush Aggarwal. Ayush, you can unmute yourself and 
go ahead and ask your question. 
Ayush: 
I hope I’m audible. 
Moderator: 
Yes, continue. 
Ayush: 
Great. Great numbers, Sumer and Kanav, in challenging times. We’ve been investors for around 
eight years now – amazing execution over this period and great data representation as well. 
We’ve been trying to make more sense of the data that you’ve been presenting. What I’d like to 
understand is: especially in this quarter on the shunt side of the business, volumes have gone 
down and realizations have gone above ₹3,290 per kg on an average basis, whereas earlier it was 
around ₹2,000 per kg back in FY23. 
So I’d really like to understand: you mentioned that you are moving from strips to components, 
but apart from that, is it also base metal prices going up that’s showing here? And is there a risk 
that whenever volumes come back, realizations might go down? Some comment on this will be 
really helpful. 
Management (Kanav): 
I think it’s essentially multiple things here. We’ve always been talking about product mix. As the

product mix becomes more favourable, you’ll start seeing realizations go up. Additionally, of 
course, metal prices do play a role. That also impacts overall prices, which we’ve already 
discussed in the past – it gets passed through. Whatever metal is impacting the material cost for 
us gets passed on to the customer. 
So when it comes to the actual valuation of Shivalik, it doesn’t really hamper us. And as we’ve 
also been talking about in the last few quarters, our focus has been more and more on moving 
into assemblies and into component-level solutions so that we can add more value and bring 
more to the table for Shivalik, in these difficult times. That’s what we have been doing over the last 
one–one-and-a-half years, and we’ll continue to do that. 
Ayush: 
That’s really great to hear. My second question is on the smart meter side. Given the scale-up that 
is happening, what sort of numbers can we see from smart meters on the shunt side and also on 
the relay side in FY27 and FY28? 
Management (Kanav, then Sumer): 
I think we mentioned this last time also. We are very hopeful and very positive. These numbers are 
already reflecting in our Q2 results. In fact, Q3 should be even better. We’re getting more 
acquisitions. 
For us this is a real growth area and a lot of activity and new developments are happening for 
Shivalik in this specific domain, and we see a very positive and bright future here. 
Also, as we have developments in some of the smaller components, it’s a little bit misleading in 
the numbers: the overall production in kilos may look like it hasn’t gone up as much, or has gone 
down, because those smaller parts add more value but, in terms of kilos, are very small. 
To clarify even further, some of our heaviest shunt material used to come from Vishay, which has 
either remained flat or gone down drastically in certain product categories. As a result, it shows 
lower production of shunts in kilos, but still growth in resistors overall and growth in the bottom 
line but owned output in terms of Kilo’s look like going down it’s little bit misunderstanding it you 
have lower value of high volume weight wise material shows very different number, where as in a 
particular quarter if you do a particular sale it will show a different set of numbers. Product mix, as 
you mentioned, plays a big role. 
Ayush: 
Great. Final question from my side: in the presentation you have also mentioned a couple of very 
interesting industries – one is data centres and second is energy storage system packs. Both are 
picking up traction in India and globally. If you can mention what sort of products we have here 
and when we can see meaningful contribution from these applications in the next 2–3 years. 
Management (Kanav): 
On data centres, we’ve always been very guided in this area. We’ve talked about it in the past as

well. For Shivalik, our products form part of the capex of data centres in some form or the other. 
More and more growth in that part of the industry will bring opportunities for our bimetals, for our 
contact business as well as for resistors, and that’s why we are very excited for all three product 
lines in this domain. 
In fact, with AI coming in, the demand and requirements for our kinds of components and 
products are expected to be around 3x what is currently being used in existing data centres. So 
from that perspective, we see a lot of traction and opportunities coming in for our components 
and products. 
Management (Sumer Ghumman): 
Also a lot depends on where our parts are going to be used. Our parts are not directly sold to data 
centre builders. Our parts go into devices that further go into those applications. So a lot depends 
on how fast development of those devices happens in the regions where we supply, especially 
India. 
We do see movement in that area. We see customers moving really fast to develop these things 
here rather than relying on imports. For example, a lot of our OEMs are signing contracts with 
global players like Google for building up various data centres, and directly or indirectly, once they 
sign those contracts, it definitely brings in opportunity for our products.

Our next line of questions will be from Saloni Jain. Saloni, you can unmute your line and go ahead 
and ask your question. 
Saloni: 
Thank you for the opportunity. Am I audible? 
Moderator: 
Yes, please proceed. 
Saloni: 
First of all, congratulations, team, on such great results during challenging times. My first 
question would be on your plans regarding onboarding OEMs directly, especially in light of tariffs 
in the US along with the muted environment there. 
On that, have we onboarded any OEMs as direct customers, and what is your outlook on taking 
market share in assemblies given longer approval cycles?

Management (Kanav): 
That’s correct, Saloni. In fact, our agenda and objective has always been to get on board more and 
more OEMs. That’s what we’ve been doing. All our efforts are being placed towards building end-
use applications and towards getting to those end-use customers. 
But you also have to understand that a lot of our products and components go through 
assemblies and built-up modules, which Shivalik has been talking about in the past. We’ve been 
saying we are trying to move towards making those assemblies so that we can directly get into 
those OEMs, and that has been our endeavour over the last year–year-and-a-half – moving more 
towards making these assemblies so that we can onboard OEMs directly rather than routing 
through different channel partners. 
Saloni: 
Sure, okay. And my second question is: you had also mentioned in past calls about a partner with 
whom you’re indigenising nickel alloys, and that was expected to happen in October. How are we 
on track there, and what are the inventory cost and working capital benefits that we’re looking at 
from this indigenisation? 
Management (Sumer): 
We are currently at a stage where the results for that development have been better than 
expected. Some of the base-level grades, which are slightly more straightforward to produce, are 
now at the final stages of testing, and so far we’ve been seeing good results. 
Which means that in maybe another three–four months’ time, about 20–25% of our total raw 
material consumption we should be able to source locally, which will have an improvement to 
some extent. But the real game-changer would probably be next year, when that number could go 
closer to 50%. That’s when we should be able to see a positive impact on both cost of materials 
and the working capital cycle.

Yes, please go ahead. 
Anirudh: 
Thank you for the opportunity. Just one question. 
Given that over time we will be doing products where the volume will be lower but the realization 
may be much higher, and we might do assemblies where the margins might be lower but the 
absolute profit can be higher, and we’re doing so much on automation – should the right financial 
metric that we as investors focus on be absolute EBITDA, given there could be a lot of movement 
in margin percentage? 
And if so, aspirationally, what is the EBITDA growth that you are looking at over the next few years, 
given there are so many opportunities and new developments you’re working on? 
Management (Sumer): 
This is something that’s happening alongside our other plans to have an impact on topline as well. 
There are projects that we’re working on actively wherein, more than just value addition, the 
example could be the PCBA assemblies or some of the other forward-integration activities. 
Some of those developments – and some that we are actively working on but haven’t spoken 
about publicly – are lower-EBITDA-margin businesses but with very high impact on topline. So the 
two activities are happening alongside each other. 
That is why earlier in another question I had mentioned it can go the other way around as well. 
Today we feel that some of our developments which are converting into business are adding more 
value-add, so you’re seeing a difference there. But if we quickly go into an opportunity where we 
can add ₹100 crore to topline in a short period of time but at a lower EBITDA margin, then the 
overall numbers will look different. 
It’s very difficult at this stage to say what that target would be because it can swing either way. But 
I think the right way to look at it is that as a management team we are working towards multiple 
opportunities in both areas. We’re not just looking at high value-add, small-topline opportunities; 
we’re working equally on both. 
The vision for the company at this point is to look at both, because we understand the value of 
sustaining this profitability by adding these smaller topline, high-margin businesses – which then 
allows us to go after higher-topline, lower-margin opportunities as well. So the two things 
complement each other. 
Anirudh: 
Got it. So what I hear you saying is it’s not so much about the margin percentage but the absolute 
rupees/crores of profit that you’re really trying to optimise for, which might come from higher 
topline–lower margin or decent topline–higher margin – it could be a combination.

Management (Sumer): 
It could be a combination, as long as we follow one methodology: we don’t want to do something 
which gives us profitability – whether at a smaller percentage or a larger percentage – that is not 
sustainable. We don’t want to get into something where we see a three-year horizon of making 
money and then it fades away. 
We want to do things where we can consistently further improve processes and maintain 
technical barriers and less competition. So sustainable profit for us is the biggest priority, rather 
than just a target margin percentage or absolute number. 
Anirudh: 
Got it. Second question was on the backward integration. Assuming you are at 50% indigenised 
raw material, do you have some indication of what kind of working capital savings and gross profit 
margin boost you can expect? 
Management (Sumer, then Rajeev): 
When it comes to indigenised raw materials, an absolute cost saving in the very beginning may not 
be possible because, obviously, with new developments the overall cost will initially either remain 
the same or even be slightly higher. We will start seeing improvement in cost over a period of time 
because we also understand that the suppliers we are working closely with have also invested 
and their costs are high at this point. 
For us at this moment, the main priority is to indigenise so that we stop relying on imports. 
Because of all these trade barriers, we know we have to have an Indian source for these materials. 
As far as the working capital cycle goes, I think Rajeev can add. Yes. Maybe from next year 
onwards, if we start 50% local supply, 
CFO (Rajeev): 
50% would be great even if we achieve a reduction in inventory days of around 30 days, it would 
have a great impact on financial costs, and circulation of cash would be easier. We can 
accumulate more cash and earn interest on the accumulated cash. 
It is very hard to put a precise number on raw material cost savings, but yes, due to saving in 
working capital days, it will have an impact and a fractional saving on the interest side. 
Anirudh: 
Got it. And just to clarify, you’re talking about net working capital days at overall company level as 
a percentage of sales – this 30 days. 
CFO (Rajeev): 
Correct, around 30 days.

Our next line of questions will be from Nirali Gopani. Nirali, you can unmute yourself and go 
ahead and ask your question. 
Nirali: 
Hi, thanks for the opportunity. Again, my set of questions are on the growth side. For the last many 
quarters we see that some segment or geography is constantly dragging our growth. 
Is it fair to understand that EV has not picked up the way it was expected to and hence shunts are 
not performing the way we would have expected, and that is one big reason for the overall growth 
rate to come down? 
Management (Kanav, then Sumer): 
Nirali, I’ll answer that question in two steps. Of course, a well-diversified portfolio can have its 
advantages as well as disadvantages. 
As you know, in the last year–year-and-a-half, the global turmoil has been such that some region 
or some area of the world is always impacted, which of course has a direct impact on businesses. 
However, being diversified also enables us to still successfully, reasonably decently, pass 
through these difficult times, and that’s what we’ve shown in the last few quarters. 
On EVs specifically, when it comes to shunts, as we’ve mentioned in the past, we expect demand 
for our shunts not just to be limited to EV requirements but also in general for ICE engines or even 
if alternate hybrids come in. 
What we’ve seen recently is that there is a lot of stop-start kind of activity, especially in the 
western part of the world, where the industry is still trying to figure out what the right way forward 
is. That’s where a lot of acquisitions and new projects are being put on hold or delayed, and you’ll 
see that on the shunt side we’ve been doing pretty well in Asian geographies, because that’s 
where the majority of new acquisitions and new project implementations are happening. 
So yes, the industry is still figuring out the right way forward, which has definitely slowed down the 
overall growth that we were anticipating, but it’s not just specifically restricted to EVs. 
Nirali: 
Right, fair enough. See, there is no doubt on your technical capabilities or products. But

historically we have seen some very strong performance – whether revenue, EBITDA or profit. Is 
that a distant dream for the next few years at the moment? 
Because the last two years have been flattish; this year also we are not going to see that kind of 
growth. If we want to focus on when we see it picking up – because new products will also take 
time, the forward and backward integration will take time – when do we see that coming into the 
numbers and repeating our historic performance? 
Management (Kanav): 
A lot of new activities that we are already undertaking, or have taken in the past year–year-and-a-
half, we’ve always said they take time when it comes to our kind of products. But a lot of them 
have now already started to take shape. We are in prototype stage, in pilot-production stages, and 
this is now going to get ramped up. 
We feel that we’ll definitely have a stronger Q4 and, of course, a much stronger FY27. 
Management (Sumer): 
I’ll also add something very interesting here. Our anticipation of a lot of our growth was from 
developed markets such as the US and Europe. What we are now seeing, interestingly, is that our 
biggest growth market for automotive shunts – whether it’s EVs or hybrids – specifically for two-
wheeler EVs, is coming from India. 
The kind of forecasts and developments we have for some mainstream models from large two-
wheeler players in India is one thing that, in a very short term, could bring about that level of 
growth. Percentage-wise, those growth numbers, if everything goes well, could repeat those 
levels that happened a few years ago. 
And the moment you supplement that with the fast growth that we are already experiencing from 
the smart-meter side – and irrespective of whether smart-meter installations go up or not, for us 
the growth is still there because of the relays being manufactured here – we are very optimistic 
about the next two quarters and the next financial year. 
You are looking at this as flat growth – this 8%, 7%, 10% kind of growth in certain quarters. Why it 
looks like that is because, even after a decline of over 20% year-on-year for almost two-and-a-half 
years now from a large customer like Vishay, which used to be 30–35% of our total revenue, we 
are still registering 8–10% growth. 
So your question is very valid and it could be a cause of concern for a lot of people. But when you 
look at it from the other point of view – with your major customer reducing their buying by 20–25% 
year-on-year and you are still registering 10% growth – where is that coming from?

That is coming from exactly what Kanav mentioned: all of those developments that we have done 
in the last 2–3 years are now materialising into business. Whether something takes one year or 
two years to do, it can vary straight away by two–three quarters, as we have been seeing. 
Because those developments are converting into business now, we feel optimistic. For our kind of 
business, when you look at it from the product point of view, you’ll realise that one or two quarters 
here and there is extremely normal. 
We have to give some kind of timeline when we talk about the future, but those numbers can vary. 
What we are happy and optimistic about is the fact that those developments have taken place, 
they’re approved, and they’re moving ahead. As and when they convert into business, we will see 
growth happening. 
So when it comes to shunts and EVs and automotive components, there’s a lot to be very 
optimistic about for us as management.

Great to know. Hoping for a better future. That’s it from my side, thank you.

Our next line of questions will be from Deepak. Deepak, your line is unmuted; you can go ahead 
and ask your question. 
Deepak: 
Yeah, thank you for the opportunity. Am I audible? 
Moderator: 
Yes, please go ahead. 
Deepak: 
Hi. So, earlier in the call, you nicely pointed out that looking at shunt resistor volumes alone might 
be misleading because there is an inverse relationship between value addition and volume growth 
– that’s why you see higher realizations but subdued volumes. 
My particular question is regarding the bimetal front. In the last call we sounded relatively 
confident that for year-end FY26 we’ll achieve a volume growth of around 7–8% in the bimetal 
front. Now, looking at the current quarter with a flattish kind of growth year-on-year, it appears 
very difficult because in H2 that implies an ask rate of almost 10%.

So firstly, what is our volume target for FY26 and FY27 from the bimetal front? And why is it that 
the Indian revenue continues to see a decline on a year-on-year basis – is it something that we are 
losing market share, or that the end-products in which we are supplying are not doing well? Could 
you please elaborate on that? 
Management (Sumer & Kanav): 
We’ll start with the second part of your question on the domestic market. 
Yes, we’ve seen muted, relatively subdued demand in the domestic market. The reason is clearly 
not that we have lost market share, but we also have to understand that a lot of our Indian 
manufacturers to whom we supply components, parts and bimetals also export. 
So they are also facing a similar issue to what we are seeing in terms of tariffs and global 
geopolitical situations. Even if for us the supplies are within the domestic region, a lot of the end-
product goes to international markets, which has an impact on our overall sales. 
We had anticipated that this would get better based on feedback from customers. However, what 
we are now seeing from most of them is that Q1 next year, or Q4 of this financial year, is where 
they are projecting very strong numbers again, because in anticipation of an India-US trade deal, 
they expect conditions to normalise. 
Many end-customers have reduced their forecasts, anticipating lower demand in those parts of 
the world. So those things have an impact, but we are now seeing some positivity coming from 
customers in anticipation of this trade agreement. 
Deepak: 
But the Indian revenue would be related to the domestic market, right? It is not as if, if you’re 
supplying to an Indian company and then it exports outside, those would be captured in your 
America, Europe and other Asia buckets, correct? 
Management (Sumer): 
No. If we supply to an Indian customer, for us it is domestic sale. What they produce and export, 
and what percentage of their output is exported, is something that in many cases we won’t know 
in detail. 
So it does have an impact, although it’s difficult to quantify. It’s cyclical – sometimes our supplies 
to a customer like, for example, Havells, go up because export orders are up, and sometimes they 
say their export orders have completely gone down. 
Deepak: 
Okay, got it. So at best I would presume that 4–5% growth is what would happen in FY26 in 
bimetal in volume terms.

Management (Kanav): 
That’s definitely realistic. We think it should be more than that, hopefully, but that’s something we 
do expect will happen. 
Deepak: 
Okay. My second question is with respect to shunt resistors. There is some issue going on with 
European automobile companies with respect to chip sourcing from a Dutch company, Nexperia, 
and because of this ongoing tussle between Europe and the Chinese government, a lot of auto 
companies have flagged that they are not able to source chips. 
Are we seeing any slowdown further in the European geography for shunt resistors – in terms of 
order-book visibility? 
Management (Sumer): 
We were anticipating growth which has not happened; it’s basically subdued, and that is because 
of the current issues that are already there. It is already reflecting in our numbers. We don’t really 
foresee further reduction from here. 
Deepak: 
Okay. Final question is with respect to our growth visibility. You highlighted the PCBA 
arrangement. We had two projects: one was related to a white-label agreement with one of the 
clients and another was PCBA, and white-label revenue was supposed to flow through in FY26 
with PCBA coming in FY27. 
Just wanted a clarification: which project is getting translated into revenue for us in which year or 
quarter, and how will you ramp that up? 
Management (Sumer): 
The white-label agreement business has already begun, as we had anticipated, with a clear 
forecast from our customer for Q3 and Q4. For Q3 our orders are already in place; for Q4 we 
already have a forecast. 
So the white-label agreement part of it is all as per plan. Our forecasts are also as per our original 
expectations. Now, because of tariffs etc., things can change in the future – not that we have any 
indications of that at this point – but as of now, that is absolutely in order. 
PCBA, as Kanav mentioned earlier, should start contributing revenue from Q4. Those 
developments and testings are already taking place at customers’ end. There are two or three 
developments that have reached advanced stages, so Q4 onwards we will have certain revenue 
from that business this year, and we will have regular revenue throughout next year. 
So, to simply answer your question: both are absolutely on track.

Moderator: 
Thanks for your questions, Deepak. 
 
Moderator: 
Our next line of questions will be from Jayesh. You can unmute yourself. 
Jayesh: 
Thanks for giving me this opportunity, and congrats for resilient numbers. I have a couple of 
questions. 
One is: I think maybe you’ve answered this in terms of your gross margin – this quarter they are 
about 2.5% higher than the trend we’ve seen. Do you think this is sustainable, or is this a one-off? 
Management (Sumer): 
As I had mentioned earlier, I’ll give you a simple, real-life kind of example as to what’s causing 
this, and then you’ll know whether it’s sustainable or not. 
Earlier we were talking about a major customer of ours, Vishay, who used to buy very large 
volumes of continuous strip-form welded shunt material from us. They used to manufacture the 
shunts or resistors and we supplied the strip. 
When we do that kind of business, the value-add in that business is much lower because making 
parts out of that strip is a very long-drawn process; it involves a lot of steps and high-precision 
operations. So there’s a lot of value-add involved in part-making, not in strip supply. 
Now, that strip business has consistently gone down as a total percentage of our revenue and 
even in overall volume. At the same time, as I mentioned earlier, we have faced from Vishay about 
a nearly 20% reduction for the third year in a row. It has come down to almost half of what it once 
was. 
Even then, overall for our resistors and shunts business, we are registering about 8–10% growth. 
So where is that growth coming from? It’s all coming from components – and many of them being 
high value-add components. That is exactly the reason why you are seeing a growth in margins. 
All of those businesses are not temporary. In fact, if anything, the complicated small-component 
business, a lot of which has been added and which is causing this, is definitely a longer-term 
business than strip supply, for example. 
   
                                                                                                                                                                                     
  Produced & transcribed by

Strip business has fewer production processes. Tomorrow, maybe, Vishay can buy strip from us 
or maybe from somebody else if tariffs remain; but when we are making a high-precision, small 
component, for which years of development and tooling investments have gone in, even a 50% 
tariff cannot immediately push a customer to start buying from an alternate source. 
So our developments have moved more and more towards that, and that is evident. That is what is 
causing this. If anything, I would say that this improvement in margin is more sustainable than it 
has ever been. 
We are following a very similar strategy even in thermostatic bimetal, where we want to supply 
more and more high value-add components. Eventually, at some point in the future, maybe a year 
or two down the line, we will start seeing this trend show up in numbers – the bimetal gross 
margins will also rise. By then, if our raw material is indigenised, we will see maybe a further 
improvement in gross margin. 
So this is one part of multiple areas of strategy where we are working on top line and bottom line. 
Jayesh: 
Sure, that helps. But this sharp improvement is visible primarily in the last two quarters. In Q1 
FY26 we improved our gross margin by about 1.5%, and this quarter another 2.5% QoQ – so a big 
improvement in a very short span, from close to 57%, about 400 basis points improvement. That’s 
why I was asking if this is sustainable. Vishay business has been reducing as you said last couple 
of years but this improvement in last two quarters. 
Management (Sumer): 
Because a lot of the business that we developed prior to that – say something that may have 
started in 2022 or 2023 – is now showing up as substantial business. 
In a small-size resistor, even if it’s not automotive, typically, a development that starts in 2023 
usually takes somewhere between 18–24 months for process development as well as approvals 
to complete. Then we usually see between 10–20% of the original forecast volume in year one, 
going up to 30–40%, and if you club everything, it becomes a 4–5 year process. 
If there is a delay, a rejection, or some kind of result not being met and R&D has to be redone, that 
can drive it up to even 5 years. That is exactly what the entry barrier is. 
So maybe a little bit of patience at this point, but when it adds business, it adds it in a big way – 
and we’ve seen that happen in the past. Why we feel optimistic is because, in the last two years, 
the total number of developments we have done – in terms of customer part numbers as well as 
potential business value – has been more than what we had done in 10 years combined. 
So whether it happens over two quarters or four quarters, that is a variable thing, but it will 
happen. Those investments have been made by both Shivalik and the customer.

If those developments were not taking place and had not been successful, we would have a big 
problem and we would be worried at this point of time. But we are not worried because of that. It 
is only a matter of timing. 
Jayesh: 
Understood. Just one more question. We have been incurring some amount of capex. If you see, 
for quarter ended September 25, we have about ₹32 crore in capital work-in-progress. What is it, 
and when do you think we are going to come to the end of this capex programme? 
Management (Sumer & Rajeev): 
We had major capex come to an end about two years ago, other than maintenance capex, but we 
have slightly changed our strategy. 
We have seen that the cost of manpower has been consistently increasing in the area that we are 
in, and we have been facing issues related to getting the right manpower. It’s sometimes difficult 
to find the right technical people for certain processes. 
Keeping these factors in mind, we have been focusing a lot of our capex and development activity 
towards automation. We’ve seen that in the medium- to long-term it makes a lot more sense for 
us to continue to focus on automation. That strategy has, obviously, caused us to incur more 
capex, but we should be able to see benefits over the medium term. 
CFO (Rajeev): 
Since it’s a consolidated number and our subsidiary is in expansion mode, out of ₹32 crore almost 
₹20 crore pertains to SEPPL, which is underway for capitalisation – that’s why it looks high 
compared to previous quarters. 
And even in that capex, towards the finishing stages of that wholly owned subsidiary for the 
contact business, our strategy again was to go for more automated processes rather than manual 
operations. So what we had originally planned versus what we actually ended up incurring was 
different; the number was higher. 
We also acquired more land to expand in line with the long-term vision for SEPPL itself, that’s why 
original gets extended by 20-25%. This capex will be capitalized by the end of December, which is 
why it is currently under CWIP.

Got it, that answers my questions. Thank you.

Our next question will be from the line of Naushad. Your line is unmuted; you can go ahead and 
ask your question. 
Naushad: 
Hi, thanks. Hope I’m audible. 
Moderator: 
Yes, go ahead. 
Naushad: 
Congrats, team, for a decent set of numbers in tough times. A couple of clarifications. 
Firstly, on the growth side: given the consolidation we have experienced in the last two years, and 
assuming the cycle revives – especially in the pockets where we are currently facing problems – 
and if we have not lost market share or clients, then in the first year of revival, should we 
experience at least an exponential growth versus our historical rate, and then it should normalise? 
How should the first year of recovery look from a growth point of view? 
Management (Kanav & Sumer): 
You’re absolutely right. We were also internally discussing that once the recovery starts 
happening, with the existing activities that we have initiated and are already working on, we would 
actually see a very high recovery rate. 
As we mentioned earlier, even if our customers come back to their base levels without further 
growth, we would see a substantial increase in our top line as well as bottom line. 
Naushad: 
Does this imply that whatever negative experience we are currently having with Vishay is because 
of demand and their inventory, or is it because they’re shifting their sourcing to someone else? 
Management (Sumer): 
It’s a combination of both. What has happened is that a lot of business from Vishay has shifted to 
some of its competitors, and we have also received some of that indirectly, which is why we still 
have substantial growth in shunts overall even after such a decline at Vishay. 
What we see now, interestingly, is that there are certain developments at Vishay which could 
bring them back to their earlier volumes. They have developed some new types of resistors using 
welded shunts, and the kind of welding they need for that they can only source from Shivalik.

So, as part of the white-label agreement we have with them, we foresee that development moving 
very fast. If those numbers materialise, business from Vishay could come back to similar levels as 
a percentage of our revenue in the next year itself. 
This is a possibility. I would say about 50% of it is still on the optimistic side, but it is right there in 
front of us; it is not something that is yet to be developed. 
Now, if this 50% tariff in the US remains for long, even a company like Vishay, which values and 
has faith in Shivalik’s products, will at some point have to look at alternate strategies. So 
assuming that some resolution comes in – because that American development for us, for shunts 
and bimetal, becomes very important – when that recovery happens, we expect it to be sharp. 
Naushad: 
Just to clarify: what I’ve understood is that we are not losing market share from a Vishay point of 
view, but Vishay itself is losing market share, and that’s impacting us. Have I understood that 
correctly? 
Management (Sumer): 
That is part of the problem. The biggest reason was that Vishay was very over-optimistic on their 
volumes, and they over-ordered. They were stuck with inventory which took them more than a 
year-and-a-half to normalise. Some of the reduction came from that, which we’ve talked about 
earlier. 
Some part of it is also that there are competitors of Vishay which have taken some of their 
business. In those cases, if that competitor was buying, say, 20% of their volume from Shivalik 
and Vishay was buying 60%, then if that business goes to the competitor, indirectly some of that 
business we have also lost. 
But with the new developments at Vishay, we should see numbers moving back because they 
have a clear technical advantage in those new designs. 
Naushad: 
Next, on the client-addition side. Earlier we had talked about BYD and Hella China – these new 
clients. What is the progress there? 
Management (Sumer): 
Hella China is already a customer; we are already supplying certain components to them. The 
new development with Hella was related to the Indian market, which is on track at this point in 
time and under various stages of development. 
BYD is a development that we are doing through Vishay. At this point of time that is also as per 
track, and that is not just for BYD but also for other designs. So we are doing a lot of developments 
with Vishay for some new customers, though not directly at this point of time.

Naushad: 
Last question from my side. From a domestic point of view, in the last five years the EMS industry 
– the assembly guys – has done quite well. Now, given the different policies that are coming to 
support the component side of EMS, any thoughts on that, and how are we planning to participate 
in this growth for EMS components? 
Management (Sumer): 
We are now at advanced stages of entering some new product verticals which are related mainly 
to electronic applications. We are also making use of this ecosystem where we are getting certain 
advantages. 
We have finalised which components we are looking at; we have done the financial working on 
them; we are at the stage of finalising the “where” – including location and line-up. So very soon 
we will be in a position to make a formal announcement as to what we are doing and what kind of 
products we are entering. It’s just a little before that stage right now, so I won’t be able to talk 
much more about it. 
But yes, we are at advanced stages of participating in electronics-components manufacturing, 
wherever we see some connection to what we already do – either at a customer base level or a 
metal-working process level where we have technical advantage. 
We have chosen products on that basis; none of them are something that is completely new to us. 
We’ve steered clear of those kinds of developments. 
Naushad: 
Got it, thank you so much. 
Moderator: 
Thanks, Naushad, and thanks, Sumer, for your answers. 
 
Moderator: 
We’ll take the last question for the day from Bhavya. Bhavya, your line is unmuted; you can go 
ahead and ask your question. 
Bhavya: 
Hi. So until the last call, I think we spoke of ₹150 crore coming in FY27 from PCBA assemblies and 
other forward-integrated products. Do we still think it is achievable? Because in one of the earlier 
answers you mentioned a number of ₹50–70 crore, so I wanted to clarify. 
Management (Sumer): 
So that was specific to PCBA. The earlier ₹150 crore we mentioned was the potential from all 
identified forward-integration opportunities combined. Some of those opportunities may not yet

be in hand in terms of development, but can be accessed and are being targeted. That was the 
potential. 
That Kanav spoke about is related to the developments that we already have in hand and are 
actively working on. Those have obviously reached a stage where they can realistically be part of 
the topline. 
Bhavya: 
Understood. And just as a last question, could you please share an update on the progress with 
busbars? Because I understand they enable faster production, but how are they in terms of cost 
competitiveness? 
Management (Kanav): 
In terms of busbars, we are developing certain specific designs which will also be IP-protected 
technologies and will bring a reasonably good level of value addition. In fact, one of our biggest 
advantages in these busbar developments is cost competitiveness – that is one of our strongest 
points. 
Bhavya: 
Got it. Can you maybe just finally give us guidance on how you see FY27 panning out – what sort of 
growth do you see? 
Management (Sumer): 
Again, assuming that these trade-related issues that we are facing get resolved – we have to 
understand that a lot of our existing business as a percentage was based on the US. It had been 
consistently going down; our exposure has come down from nearly 40% to about 17–18% 
recently, but that 17–18% still has an impact. 
Where these trade-related issues take this business, and how much impact it has on the overall 
market, is a key variable. Assuming all of those things are corrected – and we all hope that they 
are – and keeping in mind our new developments, new projects and Vishay’s forecasts on their 
existing business, we feel that double-digit growth for next year is definitely doable and 
achievable. 
Probably it could be on the higher side of double-digits – somewhere in the range of 13–14% to 17–
18%. That is what we have in mind; it is possible with the developments in hand, but there are 
many variable factors out there, as you can imagine. 
Bhavya: 
Understood, thank you so much.
