ORDER 
(Hybrid Mode) 
18.11.2025: Ld. Counsel for the Respondent No. 1 submits that he 
has already filed affidavit vis a vis the application for recall. Ld. Counsel for 
the Respondent No. 2 submits that he has also filed the reply with regard to 
the same. 
2. Ld. Counsel for Respondent No. 4 (Prudent ARC Ltd.) Shri Sumesh 
Dhawan, as well as Shri Prateek Kushwaha, Ld. Counsel appearing for 
Respondent No. 5 (UCO Bank) submits that some reasonable time be 
granted to them for the purpose of filing reply vis a vis the recall application.
3. We have already recorded in our order dated 10.10.2025 that 
Respondent No. 6 i.e. WLD Investments Pvt. Ltd. has never appeared before 
the NCLT nor in any proceedings before this tribunal when the appeal was 
pending, therefore, in our considered opinion no opportunity was required to 
be given to him in these proceedings as the only aggrieved party, who had 
challenged the order of this appellate tribunal was the applicant of this 
application. In the same order we have also recorded that Respondent No. 7 
i.e. FORTUNE GLOBAL SOLUTIONS PVT. LTD. was in consortium with 
Respondent No. 1 and he has not filed any appeal and therefore his 
presence would also be irrelevant. Thus, in our considered opinion, there is 
no need to provide any opportunity to either Respondent No. 6 and 7 so far 
as the application moved by the applicant for recall of the order of this 
tribunal passed in CA (AT) (Ins) No. 859 of 2025 is concerned. 
4. It has been indicated by Ld. Sr. Counsel appearing for the applicant 
that we have recorded in our order dated 10.10.2025 that at the behest of 
the either party application for recall shall not be adjourned. 
5. Be that as it may, as we have proceeded to decide the recall 
application finally and in our considered opinion last opportunity should be 
provided to the Respondent No. 4 and 5 to file their replies vis a vis the 
recall application filed by the applicant- Cosmic CRF Ltd. 
6. In view of above, we direct to list IA No. 4810, 5965 of 2025 on 
17.12.2025. 
7. We clarify that the Respondent No. 4 andS shall file their reply 
within two weeks and no more time from today with an advance copy to Ld.
Counsel for the applicant who in turn if so wish may file the rejoinder till the 
next date of listing. 
8. It is again clarified that as these proceedings are commenced under 
the order of Hon’ble Supreme Court no further opportunity of filing reply 
shall be provided to any of the Respondents. 
9. At this juncture, we notice that the reply which shall be filed by the 
Respondent No. 2 has been filed with little delay and it is in this background 
the same has not been taken on record. 
10. We direct the office to keep on record the reply filed by the 
Respondent no. 2. Permission to file the hard copy of the same is also 
granted to Ld. Counsel for the Respondent No. 2. 
11. Interim order dated 10.10.2025 (in para no. 23 of the order) shall 
remain in operation till the next date of listing. 
12. As directed list on 17.12.2025.
