Media Statement 
 
Background and Summary of Today’s Proceedings in the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
India 
 
 
Background 
 
• In 2019, Prashant Bhushan’s Citizen Whistle Blower Forum [CWBF] filed a Public Interest Litigation [PIL] before 
the Hon’ble Delhi High Court, alleging irregularities in lending practices of Sammaan Capital Limited  [SCL] 
involving loans to five borrower gro up companies, and alleging quid pro quo between the five borrower 
groups and the erstwhile promoter Mr. Sameer Gehlaut . The loans were extended during the period when 
the erstwhile promoter was the Executive Chairman of the Company 
 
• The petition sought dir ections for investigation by statutory and regulatory authorities, including i. Reserve 
Bank of India [RBI]; ii. National Housing Bank [NHB]; iii. Securities and Exchange Board of India [SEBI]; iv. 
Ministry of Corporate Affairs [MCA] 
 
• The statutory and regulatory agencies found no wrong doings  by SCL in relation to the loans granted to the 
five borrower group companies, and filed affidavits to this effect in the Hon’ble Delhi High Court 
 
• In totality, SCL has received repayment of the entire principal plus interest from three of these loans way 
back in 2019 itself , and the other two loan outstandings are also NIL as on date. The same has also been 
stated in the affidavits filed by the above-mentioned regulatory agencies and statutory bodies 
 
• Based on these affidavits, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court comprehensively dismissed the petition in February 
2024 
 
 
 
Today’s developments are from the appeal against the Hon’ble Delhi High Court order filed in October 2024 in 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India 
 
• There are no open investigations pertaining to the allegations in the PIL against SCL with any investigative 
agencies such as CBI, ED, EOW or any regulatory/ statutory bodies viz RBI, NHB, SEBI, MCA, SFIO etc 
 
• Noting that no wrongdoings have been found against S CL in any of the affidavits filed by various regulatory 
and statutory bodies, during the course of today’s hearing, the Hon’ble Supreme Court made it abundantly 
clear that it has made no negative observations against Sammaan Capital’s conduct, specifically clarifying that 
“we have not expressed any opinion against Sammaan Capital Limited”. The Hon’ble Supreme Court ’s 
direction in the case now gives SCL an objective way to emerge from the under the cloud of these allegations 
against its erstwhile promoter 
 
• Today’s proceedings centered around the petitioners’ submissions that the erstwhile promoter has fled the 
country, has settled in London, and has acquired various 5 -Star hotels, aircrafts, yachts etc. and an 
investigation is warranted

• Mr. Gehlaut has fully exited his shareholding in SCL  and does not hold a single share in the Company since 
2023. SCL is today a promoter- less, board run, professionally managed, diversely hel d financial institution, 
with over 4 lac shareholders . SCL has no dealings with Mr. Gehlaut, his whereabouts and assets are of no 
concern to SCL. The earlier brand name ‘Indiabulls’ has also been relinquished, sold and transferred by SCL 
 
• The Hon’ble Supre me Court in its order today has directed that, as suggested by the learned A dditional 
Solicitor General, the allegations made in the petition be examined by a team of senior officials and a joint 
affidavit be filed before the next hearing. No FIR has been directed to be registered against Sammaan Capital 
Limited. The court has clarified that it has not expressed any opinion on merits against SCL 
 
• The thrust of the case now is solely against the erstwhile promoter, and quid pro quo, if any, between the five 
borrower groups and the erstwhile promoter in the matter of loans granted to them when Mr. Gehlaut was 
the promoter and Executive Chairman of the Company 
 
• The loan accounts of all the five borrower groups are NIL as on date with majority of them fully repaid way 
back in the year 2019 itself. SCL is a law -abiding corporate citizen, and it will fully cooperate to enable the 
filing of the above-mentioned affidavit in a time-bound manner 
 
 
With the direction of the case now focused on the erstwhile promoter and the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s specific 
clarification, from Sammaan  Capital’s perspective we are hopeful of a final resolution on this PIL that has now 
been dragging on for over 6 years 
 
Both IHC and Sammaan Capital continue to remain focused on obtaining the requisite approvals  for speedy 
consummation of the transaction, which will make IHC the promoter of SCL
