INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S LIMITED REVIEW REPORT ON REVIEW OF INTERIM 
STANDALONE FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 2025 
TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF Mis. BORANA WEAVES LIMITED (CIN: 
Ul 7299GJ2020PLC 1177 45) 
1. We have reviewed the accompanying Statement of Standalone Unaudit ed Financial Results of 
BORANA WEAVES LIMITED (the "Company "), for the quarter and half year ended 30111 September 
-2025 (the "Statement "), being submitted by the Company pursuant to the requirement of Regulation 
33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulation s, 2015, as amended . 
2. This Statement, which is the responsibility of the Company' s Mana gement and approved by the 
Company 's Board of Directors , has been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement 
principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting " ("Ind AS 
34"), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with relevant rules issued 
thereunder and other acco unting principles generally accepted in India. Our responsibility is to express 
a conclusion on the Statement based on our review. 
3. We conducted our review of the Statement in accordance with the Standard on Review Engagements 
(SRE) 2410 'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the 
Entity', issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). A review of interim financial 
information consists of making inquiries, primarily of the Compan y' s personnel responsible for 
financial and accounting matters , and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conduct ed in accordance with Standard s on Auditing specified 
under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013 and consequently does not enable us to obtain 
assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. 
Accordingly , we do not express an audit opinion . 
' 4. Based on our review conducted as stated in paragraph 3 above, nothin g has come to our attention that 
causes us to believe that the accompanying Statement , prepared in accordance with the recognition and 
measurement principles laid down in the aforesaid Indian Accounting Standa rd and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, has not disclosed the information required to be disclosed in 
terms of Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosur e Requirements) Regulations , 
2015, as amended , including the manner in which it is to be disclosed , or that it contains any material 
misstatement.
