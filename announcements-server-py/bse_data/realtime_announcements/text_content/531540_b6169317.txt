Surat, Reaffirming its

Junagadh Bar Association Secretary defeated
President Jaydev Joshi
India’s Link West policy: PM Modi’s
upcoming Jordan, Ethiopia, and Oman visit
Prime Minister Narendra
Modi’s forthcoming three-
nation tour to Jordan,
Ethiopia, and Oman from
December 15 to 18, 2025, will
be significant for deepening
strategic and economic
cooperation, reinforcing long-
standing partnerships, and
expanding India’s diplomatic
footprint in West Asia and
Africa. These visits are part of
his “Link West Policy”, which
focuses on deepening
engagement with West Asia,
and the “Africa Initiative”,
which is a comprehensive,
multi-faceted foreign policy
approach that centres on
enhancing 
India-Africa
relations.
PM Modi is widely
recognised for pursuing a
proactive, dynamic, and
pragmatic foreign policy that
aims to elevate India’s global
stature and advance its
national economic and
security interests. This
proactive 
approach 
is
characterised by high-profile
diplomatic visits and building
a personal rapport with world
leaders.
The visit to Jordan on
December 15-16 at the
invitation of King Abdullah II
bin Al Hussein will coincide
with the 75th anniversary of
the 
establishment 
of
diplomatic relations between
the two countries, providing an
opportunity to boost ties and
explore new areas of
collaboration in sectors such
as renewable energy and
information technology.
Jordan is a stable and
moderate voice in a volatile
Middle East region, making it
a crucial partner for India’s
engagement in West Asia.
Both nations share concerns
about terrorism and cooperate
on counter-terrorism efforts,
with high-level discussions
and agreements on defence
and security cooperation.
Jordan has consistently
supported India’s bid for a
permanent seat in an
expanded UN Security Council,
and the two countries often
align their positions in
international forums like the
World Trade Organisation.
Jordan is also very
important for India due to
strong 
economic 
and
commercial ties as well as
significant cooperation in the
fertiliser and textile sectors.
India is Jordan’s fourth-largest
trading partner, with bilateral
trade valued at approximately
$3 billion in 2023-24. Fertiliser
and phosphate trade is a
cornerstone of the economic
relationship.
India imports large
quantities of phosphates,
phosphoric acid, and potash
from Jordan for its fertiliser
industry. A major joint venture
project, the Jordan-India
Fertiliser Company (JIFCO)
between IFFCO (India) and
the Jordan Phosphate Mines
Company (JPMC), is a key
investment worth over $860
million.
Indian companies have
invested considerably in
Jordan’s textile sector. Many
Indian-owned 
garment
manufacturing units operate in
Jordan’s Qualified Industrial
Zones (QIZs), leveraging
Jordan’s 
free 
trade
agreements with the US and
other countries for exports.
India exports a wide range of
goods to Jordan, including
electrical machinery, cereals,
frozen meat, organic and
inorganic chemicals, and
automotive parts.
People-to-people and
cultural ties with Jordan are
also very important. There are
around 17,500 Indian nationals
living and working in Jordan,
primarily in the textile,
construction, 
and
manufacturing sectors,
contributing 
to 
both
economies. The two countries
have active educational and
cultural 
exchange
programmes. Jordan offers
“visa on arrival” or e-Visas for
Indian tourists, and direct
flights have been established,
boosting tourism and people-
to-people contacts. India
provides ITEC (Indian
Technical and Economic
Cooperation) slots and
scholarships to Jordanian
nationals to help with capacity
building and professional
development.
After Jordan, PM Modi will
visit Ethiopia on December 16-
17, 2025, at the invitation of
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali.
Ethiopia is important for India
due to their long-standing
historical relations, significant
economic 
partnership
(including trade, investment,
and development assistance),
and strategic cooperation in
areas like education, capacity
building, and regional
diplomacy. Ethiopia hosts the
headquarters of the African
Union (AU), making it a crucial
diplomatic hub for India’s
engagement with the entire
African continent. In essence,
Ethiopia serves as a vital
anchor for India’s broader
Africa outreach strategy,
encompassing economic
growth, capacity building, and
geopolitical alignment.
India is one of the top three
foreign investors in Ethiopia,
with over 600 companies
involved in manufacturing,
agriculture, floriculture,
engineering, 
and
pharmaceuticals. Bilateral
trade has shown consistent
growth, approaching $3
billion, making India one of
Ethiopia’s largest trading
partners. India exports
pharmaceuticals, steel,
machinery, and textiles,
while importing pulses,
oilseeds, spices, and leather.
Ethiopia has been the largest
recipient 
of 
Indian
concessional lines of credit in
Africa, with over $1 billion
committed to major projects
in power transmission and
the sugar industry.
Education has been a core
element of the relationship.
Thousands 
of 
Indian
teachers and professors have
worked in Ethiopian schools
and universities for decades,
contributing significantly to
human capital development.
India has provided numerous
scholarships and technical
training slots under the ITEC
programme and the Pan-
African e-Network project to
Ethiopian students and
professionals. In the final leg
of the tour, PM Modi will visit
the Sultanate of Oman at the
invitation of His Majesty
Sultan Haitham bin Tarik.
This will be his second visit
to Oman and will mark 70
years of diplomatic relations
between the two nations.
The Union Cabinet on Friday,
December 11, approved the
proposed 
Free 
Trade
Agreement between India
and Oman, clearing the way
for the Comprehensive
Economic 
Partnership
Agreement as Prime Minister
Narendra Modi prepares for
his visit to Oman. The two
sides are expected to sign
the 
Comprehensive
Economic 
Partnership
Agreement (CEPA) and
review cooperation in areas
like trade, investment,
energy, defence, and
technology.
Junagadh, The results of
the Junagadh Bar Association
elections for the year 2025-26
were declared late last night
(December 20). In this
election too, the unique
tradition of the Junagadh Bar
Association 
has 
been
maintained, in which the
current 
secretary 
has
defeated the current president
and captured the post of
president.
 The counting of votes,
which began in the morning,
was completed at 11:30 pm
late at night, at the end of
which Bhavesh Jinjuwadia
won.
The tradition of the current
secretary contesting against
the current president and
defeating him has been a
tradition in the Junagadh Bar
Association for a long time
now that the current secretary
always contests against the
current president and defeats
him. This year too, the same
history was repeated.
Bhavesh Jinjuwadia wins the
post of President by 52 votes.
The main candidate for the
post of President and current
Secretary Bhavesh Jinjuwadia
received a total of 420 votes,
while the current President
Jaydev Joshi, who was
contesting against him,
received 368 votes. Thus,
Bhavesh Jinjuwadia has been
elected as the new President
by winning by a margin of 52
votes.
