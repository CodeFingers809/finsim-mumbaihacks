Sub:_Clarification on price movement sought by BSE Ltd. 
Dear Sir/Madam, 
With reference to Clarification sought in Corporate Announcement regarding significant 
movement in the price of our securities, we would like to clarify as under: 
We are not aware of any information / announcement which is our opinion, may have a bearing 
on the price / volume behavior in the scrip of the Company. The Company has been making 
prompt disclosure of all the applicable event and information that have a bearing on the 
operation or performance of the Company including all price-sensitive information, as required 
under regulation 30 of SEBI (LODR) Regulation, 2015 and has not withheld any material 
information that in our opinion would have a bearing on the price movement of the scrip. 
The movement in Company share price is purely due to market conditions and apparently market 
driven on which the Company neither has any control nor has any knowledge of reasons. Neither 
there has been any transaction of shares owned by promoter or associates during the period. 
Please take the above clarification on your record.
