received by the company. 
 
I have completed the scrutiny of online voting (remote e-voting) and polling papers 
received and submit my report as under: 
 
1. The Company has engaged the services of Central Depository Services Limited 
(herein after "CDSL") as the Authorized Agency to provide secured system for 
remote e-voting process. The shareholders of the Company had been provided 
facility to vote on resolutions through the remote e-voting facility. Shareholders 
opting for remote e-voting facility, cast their votes on the designated website 
https:// https://www.evotingindia.com of CDSL.  
 
2. The Company has completed the dispatch of notice containing remote e-voting 
instruction. The shareholders of the Company as on cut-off date were entitled to 
avail the facility of remote e-voting. Shareholders who have not cast their votes via 
remote e-voting & present at the EGM were entitled to cast their votes through 
polling paper on all resolutions (Item No. 1 ) as set out in the notice.  
 
3. The remote e-voting period commenced from Tuesday, 10:00 a.m. (IST) on 23rd 
December 2025 and ended on Thursday, 5:00 p.m. (IST) on 25th December, 2025. 
All the votes received by casting of votes electronically through CDSL portal up to 
5:00 p.m. (IST) on 25th December 2025, the last date and time fixed by the 
Company were considered for my scrutiny. E-voting facility was blocked forthwith 
thereafter.  
 
4. After closure of period for remote e-voting, the members who has cast votes 
through remote e-voting were downloaded from the e-voting website of CDSL, for 
the purpose of ensuring that the votes of members who have already cast their 
votes through remote e-voting are not counted again on voting through poll. 
 
5. At the EGM, after the Chairman ordered for poll, one ballot box kept for polling 
were locked in my presence with due identification marks placed by me.

presence along with two witnesses (1) Mr. Sandeep Gupta S/o Pawan Kansal R/o 
Karnal and (2) Mr. Karan Dutta R/o Karnal who are not in the employment of the 
Company and poll papers were diligently scrutinized.. The Poll papers have been 
reconciled with the records maintained by CDSL, Registrar & Share Transfer 
Agents of the Company and the authorization / proxies lodged with the Company 

to eliminate the duplicate voting i.e. remote e-voting as well as by use of polling 
paper. A detailed register was maintained containing the particulars of 
shareholders participated in the voting. 
 
7. The polling papers, which were incomplete and/or which were otherwise found 
defective have been treated as ignored and kept separately.

EGM through polling papers, the votes cast through remote e-voting by the 
members were unblocked at 12:00 p.m. (IST) on 26th Day of December 2025 in

are not in the employment of the Company. Thereafter, the details containing 
interalia, the information about shareholders voting "For" and "Against" the 
resolutions, were generated from the e-voting website of CDSL.
