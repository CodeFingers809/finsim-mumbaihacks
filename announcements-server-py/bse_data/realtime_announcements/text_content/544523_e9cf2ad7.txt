Respected Sir/Madam, 
We wish to inform you that iValue Infosolutions Limited conducted its Board Meeting on November 
11, 2025, to consider and approve the quarterly financial results for the quarter ended September 
30, 2025, which concluded at 04:30 PM. Pursuant thereto, the Company made all applicable 
disclosures within the prescribed timelines. 
 
In this regard, the Company submitted the Integrated Financial Filing (including related party 
transactions) for the period ended September 30, 2025, with BSE Limited on November 11, 2025, 
being the date of the Board Meeting. We understand that the Integrated Financial Filing system is 
not integrated between the platforms of BSE Limited and National Stock Exchange of India Limited 
(“NSE”). It may also be noted that the Company was listed on September 25, 2025, and this was the 
first quarterly disclosure post listing, accordingly, the delay was unintentional. 
 
Upon receipt of the email from your good office dated November 13, 2025, the Company 
immediately submitted the Related Party Transactions (“RPTs”) under the Integrated Financial Filing 
system with NSE on the same day, i.e., November 13, 2025. 
 
The details as required under Regulation 30 of the Listing Regulations, read with SEBI Circular dated 
July 13, 2023, and SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024, are 
provided in Annexure I. 
 
As per the instructions issued by your good office under the aforesaid Notice, the Company has paid 
the applicable fine, the details of which are provided in Annexure II. The Company undertakes to 
ensure that there shall be no delay in compliance and disclosures going forward.
