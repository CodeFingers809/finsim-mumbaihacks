factors to recommend customized products.
Personalized formulations allow consumers to select ingredients and concentrations that suit
their unique skin or hair needs.
Consumers increasingly seek targeted solutions for specific concerns, such as anti-aging, acne,

More narrowly: the “cosmetics products” segment in India is estimated at USD 1.89 billion in
2025, with a forecast to reach USD 3.17 billion by 2030 (CAGR ~10.9%). 
By 2025, some projections had earlier pegged the overall cosmetics & grooming market
(including skin/hair care, personal care) to reach USD 20 billion (from lower base in previous
decade), reflecting rapid structural expansion. 
Another more recent estimate: the overall beauty & personal care market size was
~ USD 29.6 billion in 2024 (under a similar classification) reflecting the inclusion of broader

frequent new entrants/startups, differentiation becomes harder; only brands with strong value
proposition (quality, branding, innovation) may survive long-term.
Consumer trust and education gap: For niche segments (organic, herbal, clean beauty), building
and sustaining consumer trust is vital requires transparency, consistent quality, credible
marketing.
Sustainability & environmental concerns: As demand grows, pressure grows on sustainable
sourcing, eco‑friendly packaging, ethical practices for many players, balancing cost, compliance,
and sustainability will be a challenge.

FUTURE OUTLOOK
Astonea manufactures not just drugs (tablets, capsules, softgels, powders, ointments, etc.) but also
cosmetics / cosmeceuticals (creams, lotions, hair/ skin/ personal care). 
This dual positioning directly aligns with the two sectors we flagged as high-growth: on one hand,
rising demand — domestically and globally — for pharmaceuticals (especially generics, chronic care,
possibly specialty therapies) and, on the other, fast‑growing demand for beauty / personal‑care
products (urbanization, lifestyle change, premiumisation, digital reach).
Astonea stands to benefit from growth in both sectors; it hedges its business risk by not being solely
dependent on one vertical (e.g. only generics, or only cosmetics).
Diversified portfolio across pharmaceuticals and cosmetics/personal care
Scalability and diversification
Astonea offers contract manufacturing (third‑party manufacturing) services, but also sells under its
own brands: “Glow Up” (cosmetics) and “Regero” (pharma). 
The flexibility to serve other companies via contract manufacturing — while simultaneously building
its own brand portfolio gives Astonea multiple levers to grow: scale via outsourcing demand, margin
via own‑brand premiumisation, and risk diversification across product types.
As Indian pharma and cosmetics markets expand (both domestic demand and exports), contract
manufacturing demand is likely to rise benefiting firms like Astonea, particularly if they maintain
compliance, capacity, and quality standards.

Astonea’s 
manufacturing 
facility 
(in
Haryana) is certified with standards such
as WHO‑GMP, ISO 9001, ISO 22000, and
others (CE, Halal, ECOCERT) and they
claim separate, segregated facilities for
drugs, cosmetics/herbal products, with
zero‑liquid discharge plant, full power
backup, automated packaging lines, etc. 
Given that future growth in both pharma
and cosmetics will increasingly depend
not only on volumes but on quality,
compliance, safe production, regulatory
acceptance, 
and 
sustainability, 
this
positions Astonea well among players
who 
can 
meet 
domestic 
and
export‑market quality standards.
Their expansion: over time they have
scaled up from small‑volume production
to being capable of large-scale output
(tablets, softgels, creams, etc.), which
matches rising demand — both domestic
& international. 
Export orientation and global ambition
Companies revenues are rising: FY 2023 →
FY 2024 
saw 
growth 
(from 
around
₹67 crore to ~₹80 crore), with improving
profitability margins (PAT margin ~4.75%
in 2024). 
This financial momentum gives them
flexibility 
to 
invest 
in 
capacity,
compliance, marketing — which are critical
levers for competing in both pharma and
beauty/ personal-care spaces — especially
as those markets grow and evolve.

RISING
REGULATORY & QUALITY EXPECTATIONS
Astonea’s IPO filing and public disclosures
mention plans for exports including to
non‑regulated markets (some Eurasia, Africa,
Southeast Asia), and even new market
registrations 
(example: 
Bolivia) 
for
export‑grade ointment production. 
This aligns with a major macro‑trend: as
Indian 
pharma 
& 
cosmetics 
industries
globalize, demand for affordable generics,
APIs, affordable cosmetics, and personal
care — especially in developing regions — is
likely to grow. Astonea seems to aim to
capture that emerging export demand.
GROWTH IN FINANCIALS AND CORPORATE
BACKING 
VIA 
IPO 
— 
ENABLING
EXPANSION

Intense 
competition 
& 
market
fragmentation — especially in cosmetics /
personal care
Although 
Astonea 
appears 
fairly 
well
positioned, there are structural risks — many of
which stem from the challenging dynamics of
the pharma and cosmetics industries as they
evolve.
The cosmetics / personal care market is
very competitive, with many domestic and
global players entering (premium, mass-
market, natural/organic, D2C, etc.). As per
broader market trends, success will depend
on differentiation: branding, product quality,
marketing, 
distribution, 
consumer
perception.
For a relatively young and small-to-mid
player like Astonea (though publicly listed
now), capturing significant market share —
especially under their own brands — may be
difficult unless they invest significantly in
branding, R&D, and build consumer trust.
Regulatory, 
compliance 
and 
quality
pressure — especially as they aim export
and higher-value products
As demand increases for compliance, better
manufacturing 
practices, 
even 
for
cosmetics (ingredient safety, sustainability,
packaging, eco‑cert), Astonea will need to
continuously invest to maintain standards
across both pharma and cosmetics. While
they 
currently 
hold 
certifications,
maintaining these — and scaling — can be
capital‑ and management‑intensive.
For export markets, regulatory standards
can vary and sometimes be more stringent
(especially for regulated markets). Any
lapse can hurt reputation and business;
navigating 
compliance 
across 
multiple
markets adds complexity.
RISKS & AREAS WHERE ASTONEA MAY FACE
CHALLENGES OR EXPOSURE 
(consumer-facing, 
branding, 
marketing-
driven) means balancing two very different
business models. This dual vertical adds
operational complexity: supply‑chain for
APIs 
& 
raw 
materials, 
regulatory
compliance, 
separate 
manufacturing
protocols, 
quality 
assurance, 
marketing
strategies, distribution channels, etc.
Risk that focus on one vertical (say,
cosmetics) may dilute efforts or resources
for the other (pharma), or vice versa.
Effective management, governance, quality
controls 
are 
essential 
— 
small 
firms
sometimes struggle with this dual burden.
Managing dual business verticals (pharma
+ cosmetics) — complexity in operations,
product mix, brand identity
Astonea derives part of its business from
being 
a 
third‑party 
manufacturer
(OEM/contract manufacturing) for other
pharmaceutical and cosmetic companies.
Demand for such services depends on other
companies’ 
decisions, 
market 
demand,
outsourcing 
trends, 
and 
global/regional
regulatory environments.
Over-reliance on third‑party orders could
mean revenue volatility if client demand
dips, 
orders 
get 
delayed, 
or 
global
competition intensifies; diversification via
own‑brands reduces but doesn’t eliminate
that risk.
Dependence on third-party / contract
manufacturing 
demand 
and 
client
acquisitions
For their own brands (Glow Up / Regero /
future “Avicel”), success will depend heavily
on how they are perceived — quality, trust,
effectiveness, marketing, distribution reach.
Building a strong brand identity requires
sustained 
investment, 
clear 
value
proposition (e.g. clean/organic, affordable,
high-quality), and consistency.
In cosmetics, consumers are increasingly
discerning 
— 
expecting 
transparency
(ingredients, claims, certifications), ethical
sourcing, possibly cruelty-free / clean-label
products. 
Meeting 
these 
expectations
consistently will be key for long-term
viability.
Need for brand building, marketing, and
consumer trust — especially in cosmetics
Operating both pharmaceuticals (regulated,
drug‑safety, 
prescriptions, 
compliance-
heavy) and cosmetics/personal care 

In that context, Astonea Labs Limited — by
virtue of its diversified product portfolio (both
pharma 
and 
cosmetics), 
manufacturing
capabilities, compliance certifications, mix of
contract manufacturing + own brands, and
recent 
capital 
raise 
via 
IPO 
— 
appears
reasonably well-positioned to ride the wave.
The macro outlook for India’s pharmaceutical
and cosmetics / personal‑care industries over
the next 5–10 years is broadly positive:
sustained growth in demand, rising domestic
consumption, 
export 
potential, 
increasing
sophistication and quality expectations, and a
diversified, expanding consumer base.
ASTONEA AS A MICROCOSM OF
MACRO TRENDS WELL‑POSITIONED,
BUT EXECUTION MATTERS
If Astonea continues to invest in capacity,
maintain high standards, build brand trust, and
adapt to evolving consumer and regulatory
trends, it could capture a disproportionate
share of the growth potential in India’s
transforming 
pharmaand 
beauty 
markets,
essentially becoming a micro‑cosm of the
larger transformation we outlined earlier.
However and this is critical success will
strongly depend on execution: how well the
company manages dual verticals, invests in
quality/compliance, 
scales 
exports, 
builds
brands, competes in crowded markets, and
navigates regulatory & market challenges.

DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION &
TECHNOLOGY IN PHARMA & COSMETICS
1. PHARMACEUTICALS
Digital adoption in pharma includes AI‑driven R&D, predictive analytics for drug
discovery, automation in manufacturing, IoT for supply‑chain monitoring, and
digital pharmacy platforms for distribution.
Increasingly, data-driven quality control and regulatory compliance monitoring
are becoming critical, particularly for exports.
Telemedicine integration and e-pharmacies are transforming the domestic
distribution ecosystem, enabling companies to reach Tier-II and Tier-III markets
efficiently.
2. COSMETICS / BEAUTY & PERSONAL CARE
E-commerce platforms and D2C apps dominate growth, requiring companies to
invest in digital marketing, CRM, and AI-powered recommendation systems.
AR/VR tech allows consumers to try products virtually (e.g., “try-on” for
cosmetics), improving engagement and sales.
Supply chains are increasingly automated and analytics-driven, enabling faster
delivery and inventory optimization.
Sustainability tracking and ingredient traceability are digitalized to meet
consumer expectations for “clean and transparent” products.

HOW DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION CAN ACCELERATE
ASTONEA’S GROWTH
1. SMART MANUFACTURING & INDUSTRY 4.0
Automation & IoT sensors in Astonea’s manufacturing units can improve precision in tablet,
softgel, ointment, and cream production.
Predictive maintenance for equipment reduces downtime and improves OEE (Overall
Equipment Effectiveness).
Integration with ERP systems can unify inventory, production, quality, and regulatory data
across pharma and cosmetic verticals.
Impact: Higher efficiency, lower wastage, better compliance — aligning with India’s trend of
high-quality pharma exports and premium cosmetics production.
2. DATA-DRIVEN R&D & FORMULATION INNOVATION
Use AI/ML to analyze formulation data, optimize drug compositions, and improve cosmetic
product efficacy (e.g., anti-aging creams, hair care solutions).
Simulations and predictive analytics reduce time-to-market for both pharma and cosmetic
products.
Impact: Accelerates product development, supports specialty drugs or innovative cosmetic
formulations, strengthens differentiation in crowded markets
3. DIGITAL SUPPLY CHAIN & TRACEABILITY
Implement blockchain-enabled supply chains to track APIs, herbal ingredients, or cosmetics
raw materials from source to finished product.
IoT sensors for cold-chain monitoring (pharma) or temperature/humidity-sensitive storage
(cosmetics).
Impact: Critical for exports, regulatory compliance, and consumer trust — increasingly
required for international markets and premium domestic segments.
4. E-COMMERCE & DIGITAL MARKETING
Leverage D2C e-commerce portals, social media marketing, influencer collaborations, and 0.
AR/VR “virtual try-on” for cosmetics, chatbots for consumer engagement, loyalty programs,
personalized subscription models.
Impact: Expands reach into Tier-II/III cities, strengthens brand identity, and aligns with digital-
savvy Indian consumers.
5. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE & QUALITY MANAGEMENT DIGITIZATION
Use digital dashboards for batch tracking, adverse-event reporting, and real-time regulatory
compliance monitoring.
Integration of GMP and ISO standards in digital workflow systems ensures consistent quality
across production lines.
Impact: Supports Astonea’s ambitions in international pharma exports and high-end
cosmetics markets.

STEWARDSHIP AND GOVERNANCE
ASTONEA LABS LIMITED
Stewardship and governance are the frameworks through which a company ensures
long-term value creation, compliance, ethical conduct, and sustainable growth. For
Astonea Labs, given its positioning in two highly regulated industries (pharma and
cosmetics), good governance is critical for risk mitigation, investor confidence, and
operational excellence.
1. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE
Board Composition & Leadership
Astonea emphasizes a balanced board, comprising executive directors for operational
oversight, independent directors for unbiased decision-making, and advisors with sector
expertise.
Industry best practices suggest that boards in pharma/cosmetics companies should include
expertise in regulatory affairs, R&D, finance, ESG, and digital transformation to guide strategic
decisions effectively.
Committees
Audit Committee: Ensures financial integrity, internal controls, and regulatory compliance.
Nomination & Remuneration Committee: Aligns executive incentives with company
performance, ethical practices, and long-term goals.
Stakeholders’ Relationship Committee: Ensures transparency in communications with
investors, regulators, and partners.
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Committee: Oversees sustainability initiatives, social
impact programs, ethical practices, and community development efforts.
Implication: A robust governance framework protects stakeholder interests and supports
compliance with domestic and international regulatory expectations — critical for export-oriented
pharma and premium cosmetics segments.
2. STEWARDSHIP OF REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
Pharmaceutical Governance
Compliance with GMP, ISO, WHO certification, and drug regulatory standards ensures safe
manufacturing and market trust.
Export-focused operations require adherence to US FDA, EU EMA, or equivalent standards,
depending on the target market.
Cosmetic Governance
Adherence to ingredient safety, labelling standards, Halal, ECOCERT, cruelty-free certifications
protects brand reputation and ensures access to premium/global markets.

STEWARDSHIP AND GOVERNANCE: ASTONEA LABS LIMITED(CONTD.)
Digital Oversight
Use of digital governance platforms for batch tracking, quality reporting, supply chain
monitoring, and adverse-event reporting enhances real-time compliance and reduces
operational risk.
Environmental Stewardship
Zero-liquid discharge plant demonstrates commitment to environmentally responsible
manufacturing.
Eco-friendly packaging, sustainable sourcing of cosmetic ingredients, and energy-efficient
operations reduce environmental footprint.
Ensuring employee safety, skill development, and ethical workplace practices aligns with
modern governance standards.
Responsible marketing in cosmetics and pharma ensures consumer trust, especially in sensitive
products (herbal, OTC drugs, skincare).
Governance Integration
ESG practices are integrated into board oversight, aligning with global investor expectations,
regulatory trends, and consumer preference for responsible brands.
With digital transformation (AI-R&D, smart manufacturing, e-commerce), governance ensures:
Stewardship ensures that Astonea maintains operational discipline, quality, and safety while scaling
globally.
3. FINANCIAL STEWARDSHIP
Post-IPO, capital raised is managed to optimize operational expansion, R&D, marketing, and
capacity building.
Transparent financial reporting, rigorous internal audits, and risk monitoring are vital to sustain
investor confidence.
Governance in financial management ensures sustainable growth, particularly as dual verticals
(pharma + cosmetics) require capital for both manufacturing and brand-building initiatives.
4. ESG (ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, GOVERNANCE) AND SUSTAINABILITY
Social Stewardship
Effectively, Astonea’s stewardship integrates profitability with responsibility, reducing risks in
compliance-heavy sectors and building long-term trust.
5. STRATEGIC OVERSIGHT IN A DIGITAL ERA

controls.
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework ensures identification, assessment, and
mitigation of:
Astonea’s governance ensures transparent and ethical interactions with all stakeholders:
7. STAKEHOLDER STEWARDSHIP

information. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the
Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section
143(10) 
of 
the 
Companies 
Act, 
2013. 
Our
responsibilities under those Standards are further
described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit
of the Financial Statements section of our report. We
are independent of the Company in accordance with the
Code of Ethics issued by The Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the
financial statements under the provisions of the Act and
the rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
BASIS FOR OPINION 
EMPHASIS OF MATTER
The Company’s Board of Directors are responsible for
the preparation of the other information. The other
information comprises the information included in the
annual report but does not include the financial
statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Information other than the Financial Statements and
Auditor's Report thereon
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover
the other information and we do not express any form
of assurance conclusion thereon.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude
that if there is a material misstatement of this other
information, we are required to report that fact. We have
nothing to report in this regard.
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the
matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect
to the preparation of these financial statements that
give a true and fair view of the financial position,
financial performance and cash flows of the Company
in accordance with the accounting principles generally
accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards
specified under Section 133 of the Act, read with Rule 7
of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2021. This
responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of
the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and
for 
preventing 
and 
detecting 
frauds 
and 
other
irregularities; selection and application of appropriate
accounting policies; making judgements and estimates
that 
are

and 
prudent;

Responsibility 
of 
Management 
for 
the 
Financial
Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements
can arise from fraud or error and are considered
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial
statements.
Identify 
and 
assess 
the 
risks 
of 
material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise
professional 
judgment 
and 
maintain 
professional
skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
financial controls, that were operating effectively for
ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the
accounting records, relevant to the preparation and
presentation of these financial statements that give a
true and fair view and are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is
responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern and using the going
concern basis of accounting unless management either
intends 
to 
liquidate 
the 
Company 
or 
to 
cease
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
Those Board of Directors are also responsible for
overseeing the company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of Financial
Statements
Obtain an understanding of internal financial
controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures 
that 
are 
appropriate 
in 
the
circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act,
we are also responsible for expressing our opinion
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies
used 
and 
the 
reasonableness 
of 
accounting
estimates 
and 
related 
disclosures 
made 
by
management.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (CONTD.)
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s
use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a
material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we
are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report
to 
the 
related 
disclosures 
in 
the 
financial
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor’s 
report. 
However, 
future 
events 
or
conditions may cause the Company to cease to
continue as a going concern.
on whether the Company has adequate internal
financial controls with reference to  financial
statements in place and the operating effectiveness
of such controls.
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and
content of the financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the financial statements
represent the underlying transactions and events in
a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the
standalone financial statements that, individually or in
aggregate, makes it probable that the economic
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the
financial statements may be influenced. We consider
quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i)
planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating
the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of
any 
identified 
misstatements 
in 
the 
financial
statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings,
including any significant deficiencies in internal control
that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements 
regarding 
independence, 
and 
to
communicate with them all relationships and other
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our
independence, 
and 
where 
applicable, 
related
safeguards.

1.As required by Section 143(3) of the Act, we report that:
From the matters communicated with those charged
with governance, we determine those matters that were
of most significance in the audit of the financial
statements of the current period and are therefore the
key audit matters. We describe these matters in our
auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should
not be communicated in our report because the adverse
consequences of doing so would reasonably be
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of
such communication.
