Tata Steel’s Dutch arms face €1.4 bn 
lawsuit over pollution allegations 
Firm calls allegations unsubstantiated, says it’ll ‘vehemently’ defend itself as environmental group sues it 
saket kumar 
New Delhi, 26 December 
Tata Steel’s two Dutch subsidiaries 
are facing a €1.4 billion lawsuit in 
the Netherlands alleging health 
and property damage caused by 
emissions from the company’s 
steelmaking operations, a charge 
which the Indian conglomerate 
labelled as “unsubstantiated and 
speculative”. 
In an exchange ﬁling on Thurs-
day, Tata Steel said that environ-
mental group Stichting Frisse 
Wind.nu (SFW) has served a writ of 
summons on Tata Steel Nederland 
BV and Tata Steel IJmuiden BV on 
December 19. 
And the proceedings have 
begun before the District Court of 
North Holland in Haarlem under 
the Dutch Act on Collective Settle-
ment of Mass Claims (WAMCA).  
SFW has said that it is acting on 
behalf of residents living near Tata 
Steel’s IJmuiden plant. The lawsuit 
relates 
to 
allegations 
that 
emissions of hazardous or harmful 
substances from Tata Steel’s oper-
ations in Velsen-Noord have 
adversely 
affected 
residents’ 
health and living conditions. 
According to the ﬁling, SFW is 
seeking approximately € 1.4 billion 
in compensation, citing increased 
susceptibility to various health 
issues and loss of enjoyment of 
homes. Justifying the claim, SFW 
said that average home values in 
the region lag those in comparable 
areas due to the impact of Tata 
Steel’s operations. 
On its part, Tata Steel said that 
SFW has provided no supporting 
evidence. The company said its 
Dutch subsidiaries, collectively 
referred to as TSN, reject the allega-
tions and consider the claims to be 
without any basis. 
“TSN considers that it has 
strong 
arguments 
to 
defend 
against the claims and will vehe-
mently defend itself,” Tata Steel 
said. The company also added that, 
in its assessment, SFW faces con-
siderable challenges in establish-
ing both the admissibility of the 
case and the merits of its claims. 
Under the WAMCA framework, 
proceedings are conducted in two 
stages: Admissibility and merits, 
with each phase expected to take 
two-three years to conclude. 
Tata Steel said that given the 
nature of the process, a discussion 
on the quantum of claims is not 
expected in the coming years thus 
limiting the likelihood of near term 
ﬁnancial implications for the com-
pany. The ﬁling also disclosed that 
the SFW’s action is being funded by 
Redbreast Associates NV and 
Omni Bridgeway SA, both third 
party litigation funders. SFW has 
published a compliance statement 
outlining the compensation struc-
ture for ﬁnanciers. 
It allows them to receive either 
a multiple of their investment or a 
share of any recovered amount, 
capped at 25 per cent. 
Tata Steel said health and a 
clean living environment remain 
key priorities for its Dutch oper-
ations. The company highlighted 
that TSN has made substantial 
investments under its Roadmap+ 
programme over the past ﬁve years 
to address concerns raised by 
neighbouring communities. 
“TSN consistently ranks among 
the leading global blast furnace-
based steel producers in terms of 
CO2 efficiency, with performance 
metrics well below both European 
and global averages,” it added. 
Given these efforts, the com-
pany said it believes that SFW's 
claim lacks merit. 
The company said it is examin-
ing the documents received from 
SFW, consulting legal counsel and 
assessing potential implications.

Bengaluru, 26 December 
India’s retail sector is sharpening its focus on 
woman workforce as a key talent pool, with 
retailers across the sector planning to step up 
female hiring over the next few years. 
From shop ﬂoors to mid-management 
and leadership pipelines, retailers say 
women’s participation is no longer viewed as 
a diversity add-on but a business necessity. 
It is shaping customer experience, workforce 
stability and long-term growth. 
Retailers said as they scaled their ph ysical 
presence, women were expected to play a 
bigger role not only in sales and visual mer-
chandising, but also in store operations, people 
management and brand-building functions. 
Yet women’s participation in retail remains un -
even, with sharp disparities across categ o r i es, 
roles and regions, reﬂecting structural barriers. 
Staffing ﬁrm TeamLease Services said 
women’s participation varies dramatically, 
depending on the product being sold, even 
when jobs are similar in skill and pay. “In life-
style, fashion, beauty and cosmetics retail, 
women account for nearly two-thirds of the 
frontline workforce,” said Balasubramanian A, 
senior vice-president at TeamLease Services. 
He added, “But in electronics and consu -
mer durables, women make up barely 5-7 per 
cent, despite the work cards, compensation 
and store environments being very similar.” 
The gender gap is widest in fast-moving 
consumer goods (FMCG) feet-on-street sales, 
where travel, tough targets, low pay and poor 
facilities keep women below 5 per cent. 
Rising women’s participation has fol-
lowed deliberate workplace invest-
ments, 
with 
electronics 
manufacturing service (EMS) 
and garment manufacturers 
building 
women-heavy 
teams through hostels, safe 
transport, female-managed 
housing and paid training.  
“It’s harder to attract 
women initially, but once they 
come in, retention is signiﬁcantly 
higher,” TeamLease said. “Women 
tend to stay longer if the ecosystem works.”  
Some organised retailers are redesigning 
store leaderships, appointing women as HR 
heads. This is to boost trust, grievance 
redressal, and female workforce participation. 
The female workforce share has surged by 
23 per cent, led by ﬂexible schedules, gig 
formats, and customer-facing roles in fashion, 
beauty, and e-commerce, according to a report 
by V5 Global, a part of First Meridian Group.  
Further, India’s retail sector is poised to 
grow from $1.18 trillion in 2025 to nearly $2 
trillion by 2030, with organised retail’s share 
climbing to over 35 per cent from 18 per cent.  
Essensai067, a mall based in Bengaluru, 
maintains an almost equal gender ratio 
across its retail, food and beverages (F&B), 
operations and creative teams. Founder and 
managing director (MD) Haresh 
Mirpuri 
said 
this 
balance 
emerged organically rather 
than through quotas. “Retail 
is uniquely positioned to 
support women’s participa-
tion by blending human 
interaction, creativity and 
leadership,” Mirpuri said. 
He added, “When the 
environment is safe, respectful 
and growth-oriented, women elev-
ate the entire experience.” 
As Essensai067 expands, it expects 
women’s participation to rise further, par-
ticularly in mid-level and senior roles span-
ning community management, hospitality, 
events and brand storytelling. 
At Archies, women account for nearly 50 
per cent across its offline retail network, with 
particularly strong representation in cus-
tomer-facing roles. 
Executive director Hanisha Gandhi said 
the next phase would focus on moving 
women into supervisory and regional man-
agement positions. “Retail must move 
beyond viewing women as only frontline 
staff,” Gandhi said. “The real shift happens 
when women are trusted with responsibility, 
continuity and leadership.” 
Kolhapur-based Ghodawat Retail, part of 
Sanjay Ghodawat Group, said women ac count 
for about 30 per cent of its workforce na -
tionally, rising to 42 per cent in Maharashtra. 
Group chief human resource officer 
(CHRO) Santosh Rudrawar said it aims to 
achieve a 40 per cent female workforce at 
stores within 18-24 months through hyper-
local hiring and ﬂexible roles. “The future of 
retail growth in India depends on transition-
ing women from participation to leader-
ship,” Rudrawar said. 
Kolkata-based OEM Motovolt said women 
currently make up just over 10 per cent of its 
350-workforce, with a higher presence in man -
ufacturing among STEM graduates. Founder 
and CEO Tushar Choudhary said women will 
play a key role as the company scales oper-
ations, R&D and leadership functions. 
Ricky Vasandani, CEO and co-founder of 
Pune-based jewellery retailer Solitario, said 
the company is working towards a 1:1 gender 
balance at its head office through targeted 
hiring and mentorship initiatives. 
Satish Kumar Singh, founder and CEO of 
Delhi-based healthcare retail chain MY LYF 
CARE, said women form about half its store 
workforce and could rise to 65-70 per cent in 
three years.
Housing sales 
in 7 cities down 
14% in ’25 but 
value up 6% 
Housing sales in seven major 
cities in 2025 declined 14 per 
cent from the previous year 
even as the value increased  
6 per cent, said a report by 
Anarock, a real estate consul-
tancy ﬁrm.  
Hardening 
property 
prices, layoffs in the informa-
tion technology (IT) sector, 
geopolitical tensions and 
‘other uncertainties’ slowed 
down the residential prop-
erty 
market’s 
growth 
momentum in 2025. The 
growth in value was driven by 
demand for luxury housing, 
as the post-pandemic prefer-
ence for larger, better homes 
by branded developers con-
tinued. About 3,95,625 hous-
ing units worth more than ~6 
trillion were sold in 2025, 
compared to 4,59,645 units 
valued at more than ~5.68 
trillion in 2024. The Mumbai 
metropolitan region (MMR), 
Pune, Bengaluru, Hyderabad 
and the National Capital 
Region (NCR) accounted for 
90 per cent of all sales. 
MMR recorded the high-
est sales at about 1,27,875 
units, down 18 per cent from 
2024. Pune followed with 
65,135 units sold, a 20 per cent 
decline. Together, these two 
western markets led residen-
tial sales in 2025, accounting 
for 49 per cent of total vol-
umes. Chennai was the only 
city to see an increase in sales, 
up 15 per cent year-on-year 
with 22,180 units sold.  
As many as 4,19,170 units 
were launched in 2025, up  
2 per cent from about 4,12,520 
the previous year. MMR and 
Bengaluru saw the highest 
new 
supply, 
together 
accounting for nearly 48  
per cent of launches during 
the year. The share of new 
supply priced above ~2.5 
crore across the seven cities 
rose to 21 per cent in 2025, 
from 18 per cent in 2024. This 
trend is expected to continue 
in 2026.

Restaurants brace 
for gig workers’ strike 
on New Year’s Eve 
akshara srivastava, peerzada 
abrar & auhona mukherjee 
New Delhi/ Bengaluru, 26 December 
Restaurants are bracing for a quiet 
New Year’s Eve (NYE) as gig workers 
plan to go on a strike, after denting 
their businesses on Christmas. 
Christmas and NYE are among the 
highest volume days for eateries, and 
the strike on Thursday impacted 
orders for most eateries, especially in 
the northern parts of the country, led 
by Gurugram. 
Unions called the strikes in 
response to low and falling earnings, 
arbitrary incentives, long working 
hours, lack of social security, sudden 
ID deactivations, and platforms’ 
refusal to formally recognise unions, 
said Shaik Salauddin, founder presi-
dent, Telangana Gig and Platform 
Workers Union (TGPWU). 
He is also the national general sec-
retary at Indian Federation of App-
based Transport Workers (IFAT). 
“The last seven days of December 
are almost like a 13th month and the 
strike on December 25 impacted us 
badly. Of our 800 pan-India outlets, 
operations at almost 100 were 
impacted, leading to losses in the 
range of 20-25 per cent,” Sagar 
Daryani, co-founder and chief execu-
tive officer (CEO), Wow! Momo told 
Business Standard. 
“We felt the maximum effect in 
Gurugram, while Patna and Delhi 
faced a lunch-washout. Prominent 
southern markets like Chennai, Ben-
galuru, and Hyderabad were also 
impacted. While some orders were 
delivered through our own app, where 
we partner with players like Rapido 
and Porter, almost one-fourth of sales 
were washed away,” he added. 
Another prominent cloud chain, 
with close to 100 kitchens across the 
country, said the disruption was 
quite serious. 
“We lost almost 12 per cent of our 
sales, but on a day like Christmas, 
when volumes are massive, 12 per 
cent translates into a lot of revenue 
loss,” the industry executive said, 
adding that they are in touch with 
relationship managers from Zomato 
and Swiggy. 
“Aggregators need to do a better job 
at managing such crises, because at 
the end of it all, it is customers and res-
taurants who suffer. We rely on the 
year-end period a lot as sales are high 
and these things leave a bad taste in 
the mouth,” the executive further said. 
“Multiple representations, notices, 
and meetings were sought with plat-
form companies at city and state 
levels, but they remained largely 
unfruitful. Platforms mostly delayed 
decisions or gave assurances without 
concrete action,” Salauddin said. 
These meetings featured dis-
cussions on fair and transparent pric-
ing, minimum earnings guarantee, 
reduction of commissions, protection 
from unjust deactivations, insurance, 
and social security. 
Meanwhile, some quick-com-
merce players agreed that while there 
has not been any monumental 
impact, it has impacted services in 
some areas. In apprehension of the 
strike on 31st December, players said 
they would increase incentives. 
“Anyways during the last ﬁve days of 
December incentives are high. Just as 
during the festive season. On an aver-
age gig workers earn ~2,000- ~3,000 per 
day. During these days they will earn 
~5000-7000 per day,” said an official 
from a quick commerce platform. 
However, e-commerce industry 
executives said the strike had little 
impact on platform operations, with 
companies reporting business con-
tinuity during a peak demand period. 
Executives said companies are 
adhering to global best practices, 
offering delivery partners insurance 
coverage, access to medical care, rest 
facilities, emergency support, safety 
training, and ﬂexible work arrange-
ments as part of broader efforts to sup-
port worker welfare. 
“Some of these protests are driven 
by vested interests and political 
ambitions,” said one e-commerce 
executive. “Strike calls tend to surface 
during festive and year-end periods, 
but we have not seen any disruption 
to operations.” 
Unions called the strike in 
response to low earnings, arbitrary 
incentives, long working hours, 
lack of social security, etc
