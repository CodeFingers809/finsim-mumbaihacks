Justice for Hadi: Protesters 
block key Dhaka junction 
PTI 
DHAKA/NEW DELH! 
Bangladesh’s 
slain 
radical 
leader Sharif Osman Hadi's 
party activists on Friday blo- 
cked one of Dhaka’s busiest in- 
tersections, demanding justice 
for his killing, disrupting traf- 
fic in capital Dhaka for several 
hours. 
After 
 Friday 
prayers, 
leadersand supporters of Ing- 
ilab Moncho and July Moncho, 
joined by students and 
members of the public, 
brought out a protest proces- 
sion from the Dhaka Univer- 
sity Central Mosque and 
marched towards Shahbagh, 
where they staged a sit-in 
demonstration, ‘The Daily 
Star’ newspaper reported. 
Md Moniruzzaman, officer- 
in-charge of Shahbagh Police 
Station, said the agitators 
began blocking the intersec- 
tion at around 2:30 pm local 
time and traffic has remained 
suspended since then. 
Japan OKs 
$58h defence 
budget 
AP 
TOKYO 
The Japanese cabinet on Fri- 
day okayed a record defence 
budget plan exceeding 9 tril- 
lion yen (58 billion) for the 
coming year to fortify its 
strike-back capability and co- 
astal defence 
with cruise miss- 
ilesand unmanned arsenals as 
tensions rise in the region. 
The draft budget for fiscal 
2026 beginning April is up 
9.4% from 2025 and marks the 
fourth year of Japan's ongoing 
5-year programme to double 
annual arms spending to 2% 
of gross domestic product. 
The rise comes as Japan 
faces elevated tension from 
China. PM Sanae Takaichi said 
in November her country'’s 
military could get involved if 
China were to take action 
against Taiwan, the self-gov- 
erning island that Beijing says 
must come under its rule. 
Takaichis 
 government, 
under US pressure for a mili- 
tary rise, vowed to achieve the 
2% target by March, 2 years 
earlier than planned. Japan 
also plans to revise the secur- 
ity and defence policy by De- 
cember 2026 to further 
strengthen its military. 
Kim unveils North 
Korean plan to 
hoost missile, 
IANS 
SEOUL 
North Korean leader Kim Jong- 
un has unveiled a plan to build 
new munitions factories to ex- 
pand the production capacity 
of missiles and shells, stressing 
raising their production s criti- 
cal in bolstering 
the war deter- 
rent, state media reported on 
Friday. 
The report came a day after 
the North’s mediasaid Kimhad 
inspected an 8.700-tonne “nu- 
clear-powered strategic guided 
missile submarine” under con- 
struction. 
The North's leader ordered 
expanding the production ca- 
pacity of missiles and shells 
during his visit to major muni- 
tions industry enterprisesashe 
inspected the missile and shell 
production in the fourth 
quarter, according to the 
Korean Central News Agency 
(KCNA). It did not elaborate on 
the date of his inspection or the 
factories’ locations. Kim noted 
plans to construct new muni- 
tions factories will be decided 
at the upcoming party con- 
gress, stressing the importance 
of modernising the munitions 
industry, as per the KCNA. 
The protesters blocked the 
main roads at Shahbagh, 
bringing vehicular movement 
in the arca to a complete halt. 
Addressing the demonstr: 
tors, Ingilab Moncho Member 
Secretary Abdullah Al Jaber 
said the group would continue 
the blockade until justice was 
ensured for Hadis killing, ad- 
“From today, we declare this 
Shahbagh as ‘Shaheed Osman 
Hadi Chattar’, Our movement 
will not leave the streets until 
justice is ensured for Hadis 
Killing,” Al Jaber was quoted as 
saying by The Dhaka Tribune’ 
newspaper. Shahbagh is a stra- 
tegic junction connecting sev- 
eral key parts of Dhaka, and 
blockades there often cause 
widespread traffic congestion 
across the city. 
ding, protesters were pre- 
pared to stay overnight at the 
site if necessary.
