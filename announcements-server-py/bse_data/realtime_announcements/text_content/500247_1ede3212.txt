Dear Sirs, 
 
Sub: Intimation under Regulation 30 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure 
Requirements) Regulations, 2015 – Alteration of the Capital Clause of the Memorandum 
of Association of the Bank 
 
We refer to our letters dated November 21, 2025 and December 27, 2025 and inform you that, after having 
received the requisite approvals of the Reserve Bank of India and the Members of the Bank, the Memorandum 
of Association (“MOA”) of the Bank stands amended as follows: 
 
The existing Clause V of the MOA of the Bank relating to the Authorized Share Capital has been substituted 
with the following Clause: 
 
V. The authorised share capital of the Company is Rs. 1900,00,00,000 (Rupees One Thousand Nine Hundred 
Crore Only) divided into 1400,00,00,000 (One Thousand Four Hundred Crore) equity shares of Re. 1 (Rupee 
One Only) each and 100,00,00,000 (One Hundred Crore) preference shares of Rs. 5 (Rupees Five Only) each. 
The Company has power, from time to time, to increase or reduce or cancel its capital and to attach thereto 
respectively such preferential, cumulative, convertible, guarantee, qualified or other special rights, privilege 
condition or restriction, as may be determined by or in accordance with the Articles of Association of the 
Company and to vary, modify or abrogate any such right, privilege or condition or restriction in such 
manner as may for the time being be permitted by the Articles of Association or the legislative provisions for 
the time being in force in that behalf.  
 
Provided however, that the subscribed capital of the Company shall not be less than one-half of the authorized 
capital and the paid-up capital, if not the same as the subscribed capital, shall not be less than one-half of the 
subscribed capital and that, if the capital is so increased, the Company shall comply with the conditions 
prescribed, within such period not exceeding two years as the Reserve Bank of India may allow. 
 
This intimation is also being hosted on the Bank's website https://www.kotak.bank.in/en/investor-
relations/governance/sebi-listing-disclosures.html 
 
We request you to take the above on record and disseminate the same on your website. 
 
Thanking you, 
 
Yours faithfully, 
For Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited
